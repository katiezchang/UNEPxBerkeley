PIF SECTIONS FOR CUBA
================================================================================

### NDC TRACKING MODULE

Cuba's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) are structured around a comprehensive framework that outlines the country's commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate change. The NDC includes specific targets, such as a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, with an aspiration to achieve a 30% reduction contingent upon receiving international support. The NDC is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and reflects Cuba's commitment to sustainable development and climate resilience.

To monitor and report on progress towards these targets, Cuba has established a Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system. This system is designed to track emissions and assess the effectiveness of implemented measures. The MRV framework is integrated into the national climate change strategy, which is overseen by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment (CITMA). The institutional arrangements involve collaboration among various governmental entities, including the Ministry of Economy and Planning and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, ensuring a multi-sectoral approach to climate action.

Despite these efforts, Cuba faces several challenges in effectively tracking its NDC progress. One significant challenge is the limited availability of data, particularly in rural areas, which hampers the accurate assessment of emissions and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Additionally, the country experiences gaps in technical capacity and resources, which are essential for implementing robust MRV systems. The need for enhanced training and capacity-building initiatives is evident to strengthen the institutional framework and improve data collection processes.

Cuba has made notable achievements in its climate transparency efforts, including the development of the National Climate Change Strategy and the establishment of the National System for Climate Change. These initiatives have facilitated the integration of climate considerations into national and local development plans. Furthermore, Cuba has participated in international cooperation initiatives, such as the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which have provided valuable support in enhancing its MRV capabilities. According to the PATPA report, ongoing efforts are focused on improving the quality of data and expanding the scope of the MRV system to include more comprehensive indicators that reflect the country's climate actions.

In summary, while Cuba has made significant strides in establishing a framework for tracking its NDC commitments, challenges related to data availability, technical capacity, and resource constraints remain. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of the MRV system and ensuring that Cuba can meet its climate goals.

### SUPPORT NEEDED AND RECEIVED MODULE

Cuba's climate action efforts are supported through various financial flows, technical assistance, and capacity-building initiatives. The country has established a support tracking system that aims to monitor and evaluate the resources received for climate-related projects. This system is crucial for understanding the financial landscape and ensuring that support aligns with national priorities outlined in the NDC.

Financial flows to Cuba for climate initiatives have come from multiple sources, including international donors, multilateral development banks, and bilateral agreements. Notably, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) has been a significant source of funding, with Cuba receiving approximately USD 30 million for projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience and reducing emissions. Additionally, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has provided funding for various environmental projects, contributing to the overall financial support for climate action.

Technical assistance is another critical component of the support received by Cuba. Various international organizations, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), have collaborated with Cuban institutions to provide expertise in areas such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and disaster risk reduction. These partnerships have facilitated knowledge transfer and capacity building, enabling Cuba to implement effective climate strategies.

Despite the support received, there are notable gaps and needs that Cuba must address to enhance its climate action efforts. The country requires additional financial resources to scale up its climate initiatives, particularly in sectors such as renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, there is a pressing need for enhanced technical capacity to implement and monitor climate projects effectively. According to the ICAT report, strengthening the institutional framework and improving coordination among stakeholders are essential for optimizing the use of available resources.

In conclusion, while Cuba has made progress in securing support for its climate initiatives, challenges related to funding gaps and technical capacity remain. Continued efforts to enhance the support tracking system and foster international collaboration will be vital for ensuring that Cuba can effectively implement its NDC and achieve its climate goals.
