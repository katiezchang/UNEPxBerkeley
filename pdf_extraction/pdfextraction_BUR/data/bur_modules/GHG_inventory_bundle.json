In the same year, the sector’s GHG\nemissions accounted for 35,411.9 ktCO2eq., increasing by 6.4 % since 1990, mainly due to the increase in the country’s energy consumption, which includes the consumption of diesel and natural\ngas for electricity generation, as well as the consumption of liquid\nfuels for land transportation, mostly diesel and gasoline.\nIn 2016, the IPPU sector accounted for emissions of 776.3 ktCO2eq., representing only 1.6 % of the country’s total emissions\nexcluding FOLU, 73.6 % less than 1990, as it was the sector most\naffected by the economic crisis that the country endured in early\n1990s, and has not yet recovered, which is evident throughout the\nseries.\nThe AFOLU sector is the second most important as regards\nemissions in the country. It is also the only sector that acts as a\nCO2 sink. In 2016, it represented 20.1 % of GHG emissions in the\ncountry. In the same year, the balance of GHG emissions in the\nsector was negative, which shows that removals from forestry activities were higher than emissions from agricultural activities. The\ntotal resulting from the AFOLU sector accounted for an absolute\nremoval of 17,037.8 ktCO2eq., increasing by 1,431 % since 1990. This\n\n45\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsignificant increase is mainly due to the increase in the country’s\nforest areas since the beginning of the analyzed period, which has\nmaintained a marked increment throughout the series, increasing\nthe removal of emissions by 67.2 % since 1990.\nThe Wastes sector accounted for 7.8 % of total GHG emissions\n(excluding FOLU) in 2016. In the same year, the sector’s GHG\nemissions accounted for 3,916 ktCO2eq., increasing by 24.8 % since\n1990. The main cause is attributed to the sustained increase in the\ngeneration of solid wastes and their final disposal in uncategorized\nlandfills.\nMitigation actions\nPrioritized sectors for mitigation\nactions\nEnergy, AFOLU\nMain characteristics of mitigation\nactions\nA systemic process of identification and follow-up of mitigation\nactions began, in a more harmonized manner and with monitoring\nby the Government, from Cuba’s\nincorporation to the Paris Agreement and the implementation of\nthe Task Life.\nThe mitigation actions shown in the table below have been identified and are in different statuses of design and implementation.\nNone of them is still under an MRV system. The establishment of\nsuch a system for mitigation actions is one of the priorities included in the document General Bases for the establishment of an\nMRV System in Cuba. The country’s approach to establishing a\nreinforced transparency system under the Paris Agreement is expanded in point 4.1 of this Report.\nFor the implementation of the outlined mitigation strategy, it\nis necessary to overcome a set of important barriers, among which\nstand out:\n• Incorporation of the mitigation dimension into the strategies,\nplans and projects of the sectors and territories;\n• Design of new mechanisms and incentives for the implementation of mitigation actions;\n• Lack of personnel with sufficient training in the subject of cli-\n\n46\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nmate change, and specifically in mitigation, in the different\nsectors, territories and development projects where the mitigation dimension should be taken into account;\n• Information gathering systems designed for other purposes\nthat are inappropriate for mitigation purposes;\n• Lack of financing for the implementation of mitigation actions;\n• Difficulties in accessing the most appropriate technologies to\nface climate change, due to the regulations related to the US\nblockade against Cuba.\n• The implementation of the Life Task has achieved multisectoral and territorial approaches; however, there is still insufficient connection among sectors and between these and the\nterritories.\n• Insufficient systematization, in correspondence with the new\nrequirements of the reinforced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement, of the methodological, data and calculation basis for ex-ante evaluations, systematic monitoring\nand ex-post evaluations. For example: methodologies adopted for the determination of baselines, emission reduction\npotentials, national emission factors, among others.\n• Lack of national emission factors that more truly reflect the\ncharacteristics of fuels, technologies, processes and activities\nin the domestic context.\n• Lack of MRV systems required for the sectors, actions and\nprojects with the greatest impact on mitigation.\n\nMitigation\naction\nSector / Scope\nObjective /\nActions\nStatus\nBase year (base\nvalue) / target\nyear (target value)\nObtained Results\nImprovement\nActions\n1.

It is estimated that, if the necessary support were received, the country\nwould have a basically Enhanced Transparency Framework implemented in 2025.\nThe report presents the general Governance scheme of the\nMRV system, which will be legalized once the Decree for Confronting Climate Change is passed. Its draft is in the approval phase\nand recognizes the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (CITMA) as the body responsible for the general coordination of the transparency framework, to ensure compliance with\nthe international commitments assumed by the country related\nto the subject. In relation to mitigation and the transparency framework, the rest of the Agencies of the Central State Administration (OACE) are assigned, among others, specific functions related\nto the assessment and incorporation of the GHG mitigation dimension into their programs, plans and investment projects; as\nwell as the identification and contribution of the information required to control GHG emissions, as a tool to plan future actions\nand establish the necessary procedures to control and report these\nactions; and the management and use of available international financial resources, both from global and regional climate funds, as\nwell as from bilateral sources, to execute the investments, projects\nand actions that fulfill the priorities for tackling climate change.\nThe National Office of Statistics and Information, together\nwith the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment,\nis entrusted with the establishment of the bases of an information\nsystem for climate change that allows capturing the necessary information to fulfill the commitments assumed by Cuba, with the\nparticipation of the agencies of the Central State Administration,\nnational entities, Administration Councils, Higher Organization of\nBusiness Management, as well as any state or private entity, which\nare under the obligation to provide information directly related to\nclimate change.\nThe BUR presents the progress of the MRV system for the inventory, its objectives, governance, institutional arrangements, the flow\nof processes to develop the GHG Inventory, the phases/stages and\ntasks to be carried out in each phase of the inventory cycle, as well\nas its coordinators, participants and main verification indicators.\n\n52\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nSimilarly, for the MRV system of mitigation actions, the report\nshows its objectives, the mitigation measures to which the MRV\nsystem is applied, the governance system, requirements and form\nof presentation and registration of mitigation actions, as well as\nthe requirements and form of presentation of progress reports on\nmitigation actions.\nFinancing, technology and capacity building needs, and\nsupport received\nThe MRV subsystem for support is not designed yet in the country.

Circunstancias nacionales y\narreglos institucionales relativos a la\npreparación del Primer Informe Bienal\nde Actualización de Cuba\nEn respuesta a la decisión 2/CP17 de la CMNUCC, la República\nde Cuba como Estado Insular en Desarrollo, puede presentar a su\ndiscreción informes bienales de actualización. Cuba se ha comprometido a producir su Primer Informe Bienal de Actualización\n(IBA).\nEl primer Informe Bienal de Cuba se presenta en conjunción\ncon la Tercera Comunicación Nacional del país. Por consiguiente,\neste Capítulo ofrece una visión muy sintética de las circunstancias\nnacionales más relevantes a la formulación del presente Informe.\nEn ese sentido, se muestra una panorámica básica de la caracterización general del archipiélago cubano, estructura y condiciones\neconómicas actuales, la situación de sus principales recursos naturales y se amplía en la consideración de los principales sectores\neconómicos con mayor influencia en las emisiones y remociones\nde GEI y en las acciones de mitigación, al tiempo que se apuntan\nsus capacidades y limitaciones para lograr una mitigación efectiva\ndel cambio climático.\nFinalmente, se describen los arreglos institucionales bajo los\ncuales se formuló este Informe.\nEste capítulo ofrece una caracterización general del archipiélago cubano, de su estructura y condiciones económicas actuales, el\nestado del medio ambiente nacional, la situación de sus principales recursos naturales y de los principales sectores económicos con\nmayor influencia en las emisiones y remociones de GEI y en las acciones de mitigación. Además, se evidencian sus capacidades y limitaciones para lograr una mitigación efectiva del cambio climático.\n1.1 Perfil físico-geográfico\nLa República de Cuba se localiza en el llamado Mediterráneo\nAmericano, entre los 19° 49’ y 23° 16’ de latitud norte, y los 74° 08’\ny 84° 57’ de longitud oeste (ONEI, 2018). Los límites geográficos se\npueden observar en la Figura 1.1.\n\n56\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 1.1 Límites geográficos del archipiélago cubano.\nEl archipiélago cubano está formado por la isla de Cuba, la Isla de\nla Juventud y más de 1,600 islas, islotes y cayos. Cuenta con una\nsuperficie total de 109,884 km2 (Tabla 1.1), convirtiéndolo en el Estado más extenso del Caribe insular y uno de los mayores de toda\nMesoamérica. En su conjunto, la costa norte y sur, abarcan 5,746 km\nlongitud.\nTabla 1.1 Datos de extensión superficial del archipiélago cubano5\nExtensión superficial (km2)\nIsla de Cuba\n104,338.33\nIsla de la Juventud\n2,419.27\nCayos e islotes\n3,126.41\nPlataforma insular\n67,832\nDesde el punto de vista político-administrativo, Cuba se divide en\n15 provincias y 168 municipios, incluyendo al Municipio Especial\nde la Isla de la Juventud; y atendiendo a las características geoeconómicas se reconocen tres regiones: Occidente, Centro y Oriente.\nExisten 117.6 km2, con 17.5 km de costa, usurpados y ocupados ilegalmente por los Estados Unidos de América, donde mantienen,\nen contra de la voluntad del pueblo y Gobiernos de Cuba, una base\nnaval. Cuba no es responsable de las acciones nocivas al medio\nambiente y al clima que en ese lugar se generan.\n5 Anuario Cuba 2018\n\n57\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nCon una longitud de 1,250 km su parte más ancha alcanza 191 km,\nmientras que la más angosta es de solo 31 km. Esta configuración,\njunto con su orientación de este a oeste, no permite la existencia\nde ríos largos y caudalosos (el 85 % con extensión inferior a 40 km),\nlos que en su mayoría presentan cuencas pequeñas (menores de\n200 km2), cursos cortos de poco caudal, con una evacuación rápida\nde las avenidas al mar. Los recursos hídricos superficiales y subterráneos son limitados, mientras que las cuencas subterráneas están\nvinculadas a un fuerte desarrollo cársico y se destinan a satisfacer\nlas principales demandas de agua, de la producción y la población.\nLa insularidad del territorio cubano y la morfología de sus costas cubiertas en un 70 % por manglares, 20 % por costas arenosas o\nplayas y un 10 % de costas rocosas o acantilados, aumenta la vulnerabilidad ante los posibles impactos del cambio climático. La gran\nextensión del litoral cubierta por zonas bajas e inundables hace\nque la vulnerabilidad al impacto del incremento del nivel del mar\nsea muy alta. En este sentido, la protección que brindan los ecosistemas marinos y costeros sanos, sobre todo los manglares, que\nademás de cubrir el 70 % del litoral de la isla principal conforman la\nmayor parte de los 4,000 cayos e islotes que bordean los extremos\nde la plataforma insular cubana, es esencial para el sostenimiento\nde las actividades socioeconómicas del país, al propio tiempo estas formaciones de manglar y otros ecosistemas costeros, pueden\nofrecer co beneficios de mitigación, todo lo cual se encuentra hoy\nbajo estudio.\n1.2 Perfil climático\nEl clima se caracteriza por ser cálido tropical con estación lluviosa en el verano, aunque es bastante aceptado expresar que el\nclima de Cuba es tropical, estacionalmente húmedo, con influencia marítima y rasgos de semicontinentalidad. Como factores determinantes en su formación se encuentran: la radiación solar,\nla circulación atmosférica, y las características físico-geográficas\npropias del territorio.\nLos ciclones tropicales y las tormentas locales severas (tornados, granizadas, trombas marinas y vientos lineales superiores a\n90 km/h) son los fenómenos meteorológicos a los que se asocia\nel mayor peligro de desastre, y son responsables de algunos de los\nextremos climáticos observados. La temporada ciclónica va del\n1 de junio al 30 de noviembre, en la cual el bimestre septiembre\n\n58\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n- octubre resulta el de mayor afectación, con el mayor reporte de\nhuracanes intensos.\nCuba es signataria y aplica los acuerdos internacionales para la\nreducción de desastres en el marco de SENDAI.\n1.3 Población, salud, educación. Índice\nde Desarrollo Humano\nEn diciembre 2017, la población cubana había llegado a 11.2 millones de habitantes, con un equilibrio entre los sexos (unos 991\nhombres por cada 1,000 mujeres); el 77 % del total de habitantes del\npaís vivían en zonas urbanas.\nCuba se ubica entre los países más envejecidos de América Latina y el Caribe, y dentro de dos o tres décadas pasará a ocupar el\nprimer lugar. Esta situación está influida por una tasa global de\nfecundidad, francamente descendente que al cierre de 2017 era de\n1.6, a la vez que la eficiencia de los sistemas de salud incrementó\nla esperanza de vida a 78.45 años en 2018. Esto se resume en una\nreducción de la población entre 0 y 14 años, el estancamiento de la\npoblación entre 15 y 59 años y el crecimiento de la población mayor de 60 años, que en 2017 llegó a ser el 20 % de la población total.\nA partir de la proyección 2015-2050 habrá alrededor de 1.4 millones de personas mayores de 60 años más que en 2015, mientras\nque la población entre 15 y 59 años se habrá contraído en 0.7 millones de personas en ese mismo intervalo. Ello constituye un reto\npara la sociedad cubana y su desarrollo, y demanda atención priorizada, así como la elaboración de políticas y programas acorde a\nla reducción de la población en edades laborales proyectada y la\natención a las especificidades de la población envejecida.\nEl comportamiento de la migración general en Cuba se muestra en la Figura 1.2.\nEl sistema de asentamientos humanos (SAH) en Cuba está conformado por un total de 7014 asentamientos (ONEI, 2014), de los\ncuales 6,417 son rurales y 597 urbanos. Al cierre del año 2012 residían en ellos 10.6 millones de personas de forma concentrada,\nmientras que otros 569.9 miles lo hacían de manera dispersa.\n\n59\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 1.2 Tasa de migración externa (izquierda) e interna (derecha) al cierre de\n2017.\nEn Cuba se ha trabajado con indicadores proxy de salud, educación, seguridad social y otros, y más recientemente se ha obtenido\nel Índice Global de Pobreza Multidimensional (IPM), de la iniciativa de igual nombre de la Universidad de Oxford de Gran Bretaña,\nel cual se acompaña de otros indicadores y resultados de índices\ncomo el de desarrollo Humano (IDH) que de manera inclusiva\nconstatan y evidencian los resultados en la eliminación de la pobreza en Cuba y la creación de bienestar creciente con sostenibilidad para su población.6\nCuba, de forma preliminar y en fase de validación, es el segundo país en el mundo de 105 que participan en el cálculo del IPM\ncon el valor más bajo en este índice de 0.0005 y una tasa de pobreza multidimensional de 0.15 por ciento de su población para 2017.\nEn los 10 indicadores estudiados en las dimensiones de salud,\neducación y condiciones de vida, los de mortalidad infantil, acceso\na electricidad y asistencia escolar tienen los menores porcientos de\npoblación con privaciones.\nOtro indicador vinculado con la eliminación de privaciones y\nla consecuente creación de capacidades es el Índice de Desarrollo\nHumano (IDH), calculado por la oficina homónima del Programa\nde Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD).\nEl IDH es una medida resumen de los logros del promedio en\nlas principales dimensiones del desarrollo humano: una vida larga\ny saludable, estar bien informados y tener un nivel de vida digno.\nSu cálculo y evolución se considera como el criterio más impor6 Oficina Nacional de Estadística e Información (2018).

Boletín No.1 Ministerio de la Agricultura\n2016\nLas tierras agrícolas se distribuyen en cuatro categorías, identificadas del I al IV en orden descendente de agroproductividad. En este\npotencial el 76.8 % de los suelos son de categoría IV y III, estos suelos menos productivos están más presentes en la región oriental\ndel país; mientras los suelos I y II (23.2 %), de mayor agroproductividad están más presentes en las regiones occidental y central.\nLos principales factores limitantes de la agroproductividad son\nla salinización y la erosión (natural y antrópica) a los que se unen,\nla baja presencia de materia orgánica, la acidez, la compactación,\nentre otros.\n1.6 Agricultura\nEn Cuba 6 300 175 ha son tierras agrícolas, encontrándose cultivadas 2 765 212 y no cultivadas el resto que son 3 534 962 hectáreas.\nDe la superficie agrícola, están dedicadas a cultivos temporales\n1 151 131 hectáreas; a cultivos permanentes se dedican 1 454 239\nhectáreas y a la ganadería, 3 694 804 hectáreas.\nEl 79 por ciento de las tierras agrícolas es propiedad estatal, el\n14 por ciento es propiedad de Agricultores Pequeños y el 7 % es de\npropiedad cooperativa. Un total de 303 424 personas naturales poseen tierras en usufructo y 131 802 son propietarios.\n\n63\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas áreas ociosas han ido disminuyendo gradualmente a partir\nde 2008. Desde ese año hasta la fecha, se han entregado para la línea fundamental de producción de ganadería 1 200 299 hectáreas\nde tierra. De ellas, 1 71 748 hectáreas a 105 061 personas naturales,\nlo que promedia a 10.2 ha/usufructuario.\nPara producciones agrícolas, se han otorgado 624 938 hectáreas, de ellas, 433 086 a 144 962 personas naturales, lo que promedia a 3 hectáreas por usufructuario. Para la actividad forestal, se\nhan otorgado 14 826 hectáreas, de las cuales 9 793 a 1 253 personas\nnaturales, con un promedio de 7.8 hectáreas.\nEl área cultivada es de 2 765 213 ha. Se consideran áreas donde\nse practica agricultura sostenible por estar sometidas a procesos de\nmanejo sostenible de suelos un total de 1 051 000 ha, lo que equivale a 60 % del área. Para 2030 se proyecta alcanzar el 100 % de las\náreas de cultivo y con ello además de otras medidas de tipo agrotécnicas lograr rendimientos superiores. Para lograr esto, se aplica\nuna estrategia para la conservación y mejoramiento de suelos que\nincluye un diagnóstico y las acciones estratégicas.\nEntre las acciones o líneas estratégicas para alcanzar las metas\npropuestas por el país al 2030 se encuentran:\n• Incrementar hasta el 2030 en un millón de hectáreas la superficie agrícola beneficiadas por el Programa Nacional de\nMejoramiento y Conservación de Suelos con el propósito de\ngarantizar el manejo sostenible de los suelos.\n• Aumentar hasta el 2030 en un 10 % el rendimiento productivo\nen áreas beneficiadas por el Programa Nacional de Conservación y Mejoramiento de Suelos, para contribuir a la seguridad\nalimentaria.\n• Extender hasta el 2030 en 150 000 hectáreas las áreas bajo categorías de Manejo Sostenible de Tierras asegurando la productividad de los suelos con enfoque integrado y sostenible\nde los recursos naturales, para contribuir a alcanzar la soberanía alimentaria del país.\n\nLa superficie bajo riego actualmente es de 459 008 hectáreas, representando 7.4 % con relación a la superficie agrícola\n(6 240 263 hectáreas) y 17 % de la superficie cultivada, indicador por\nel cual se mide la superficie con riego en otros países. Se proyecta\npara el período 2019-2030 llegar al 30 %, que representa 1 413 000\nha más, con lo cual, los rendimientos agrícolas y ganaderos se incrementarían.\n\n64\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.7 Bosques y prácticas de gestión forestal\nLos bosques cubanos se clasifican en siete categorías, sobre la base\nde un conjunto de elementos de orden físico, biológico, ecológico\ny social 9 (Tabla 1.3).

La expansión futura de la generación del SEN se sustentará esencialmente en el incremento de las\nfuentes renovables de energía, en el fortalecimiento de la generación térmica convencional y la instalación de nuevas capacidades\nen Ciclos Combinados a gas.\nUna transformación esencial del marco legal nacional, ocurre\ncon la promulgación del Decreto-Ley no. 345, de 23 de marzo de\n2017, 15 “Del desarrollo de las fuentes renovables y el uso eficiente\nde la energía”, Este Decreto Ley tiene como objeto (Artículo 1), establecer las regulaciones para el desarrollo de las fuentes renovables y el uso eficiente de la energía, a fin de contribuir con:\na.\tLa elevación de la participación de las fuentes renovables de\nenergía en la generación de electricidad;\nb.\tla sustitución progresiva de los combustibles fósiles;\nc.\tla diversificación de la estructura de los combustibles fósiles\nempleados en la generación de energía eléctrica;\nd.\tla elevación de la eficiencia y el ahorro energéticos;\ne.\tla estimulación de la inversión, la investigación y la elevación\nde la eficiencia energética, así como la producción y utilización de energía a partir de fuentes renovables, mediante el\nestablecimiento de incentivos y demás instrumentos que estimulen su desarrollo;\nf.\tel desarrollo de la producción de equipos, medios y piezas de\nrepuesto por la industria nacional, para el aprovechamiento\nde las fuentes renovables y la eficiencia energética; y\ng.\tel establecimiento en el sector estatal de un sistema de trabajo que incluya la planificación de las tareas que posibilite el\ncumplimiento de los objetivos trazados.\n1.10 Transporte\nEn Cuba las diferentes categorías pertenecientes al subsector transporte, se caracterizan por proceder de diferentes zonas geográficas y tener un variado conjunto de técnicas de fabricación, lo que\n15 Aparecido en la Gaceta Oficial No.95, Edición Ordinaria, la Habana, 28 de noviembre de\n2019 Año cxvii.\n\n75\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nunido al envejecimiento técnico ocasionado por el prolongado\nperíodo de explotación, y al uso de tecnologías de baja eficiencia\nenergética, promueven altos niveles de emisiones de gases producto a la combustión. Esto se ve agravado por una no adecuada\ncalidad de los combustibles que se producen en el país, que específicamente para los medios de transporte automotor de carretera\nconstituye una limitante en la adquisición de tecnologías de última generación.\nEn el período se han realizado acciones de desarrollo en el\nsector transporte. Entre las principales acciones se encuentran la\nintroducción, en el modo automotor, de vehículos eléctricos e híbridos (ómnibus para el transporte público y vehículos eléctricos\nen algunas empresas de servicios) y la entrada masiva de motos\neléctricas privadas. En cuanto al sector ferroviario se tiene la materialización, en su primera etapa, del proceso inversionista relacionado con la adquisición de 240 coches de pasajeros nuevos\nprocedente de la República Popular China, a razón de 80 coches\nanuales entre el 2019 y 2021 y 70 locomotoras rusas objetivo contemplado en el Programa de Recuperación y Desarrollo del Ferrocarril (2016-2028).\nA continuación, se ofrece una panorámica sobre los diferentes\nmodos de transporte en el país.\n1.10.1 Transporte automotor\nEl transporte automotor es el principal responsable de las emisiones\ndel subsector transporte. Más del 50 % de la flota vehicular presenta\nuna situación técnica deficiente,16 debido al régimen de explotación\nexcesivo al que es sometido como consecuencia de la poca disponibilidad de vehículos, el mal estado de las vías, la carencia de piezas\nde repuestos y la no periodicidad de los mantenimientos.\nEn el año 2017, la edad promedio de todo el parque vehicular\nera de 35.2 años (Figura 1.11), siendo los más envejecidos los autos,\nlos jeeps y las camionetas. La mayor incidencia en este envejecimiento lo tienen los vehículos particulares. Los paneles, ómnibus\ny microbuses están alrededor de los 20 años de explotación. En la\nactualidad el 89 % de los vehículos automotores, son equipos tractivos17 y se encuentran en buen estado de funcionamiento.\n16 Biart H. Rafael, et al.

Fuente:\nDatos del Registro de Vehículos y elaboración propia.\n1.10.2 Transporte ferroviario\nLa transportación de pasajeros por este modo de transporte se ha\ncaracterizado por el decrecimiento continuo del parque de equipos,\nel que se encuentra en mal estado técnico por ser de segunda mano y\ntener largos años de servicio, con reparaciones diferidas, bajo Coeficiente de Disponibilidad y un elevado Índice de fallos. Esto ocasiona\natrasos en la corrida de los trenes y alteración en la circulación ferroviaria, problemática que se extiende también a los coches motores.\nEsta situación ha originado la necesidad de sustituir algunos\nservicios por ómnibus y disminuir la frecuencia de salida de los\ntrenes nacionales a cuatro días. La calidad del servicio es deficiente, así como su confort, no existiendo una logística que garantice el\nsuministro de piezas de repuesto de manera estable. La velocidad\nde circulación de los coches ha tenido que ser reducida por su mal\nestado técnico\nEn el caso de la carga las transportaciones se han visto afectadas\npor la baja disponibilidad de locomotoras de alto porte, así como alto\níndice de fallos, alta rotación de los medios de transporte, bajo coeficiente de disponibilidad técnica de los vagones e incumplimientos de\nlos plazos de descarga de casillas en los Centros de Carga y Descarga.\n\n78\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nA partir del 2016 se ha visto una revitalización en este modo de\ntransporte, fundamentalmente con la adquisición de nuevos equipos tractivos y arrastres lo que favoreció el incremento del nivel\nde actividad del sector en la transportación de pasajeros y carga\nrespectivamente. El incremento de aportación del ferrocarril en el\nmovimiento de las cargas, conllevó una sensible disminución de la\nmisma para el automotor.\n1.10.3 Transporte marítimo\nEste modo de transporte en el país está subdivido en flota auxiliar de puerto y la de cabotaje, presentando cada una las siguientes\nproblemáticas.\nFlota auxiliar de puerto\nSe cuenta con 34 remolcadores; 20 lanchas de prácticos; siete (7)\nnaves auxiliares; 12 naves de consignatarios; una (1) patana taller;\ncinco (5) grúas flotantes; una (1) patana de carga PC-400; una (1)\ndragalina; cuatro (4) lanchas limpia-bahías y una (1) patana para\nrecogida de basura. Las naves auxiliares del puerto han sido operadas por alrededor de 23 años como promedio, estando el 21 % en\nmal estado técnico o no operacional.\nEn cuanto a los remolcadores se han operado por 17 años como\npromedio. A pesar de su relativo poco tiempo de uso, el deterioro\nde los mismos es más severo que en las otras naves.\nCon relación a la mitad de la flota de combustible esta se encuentra en mal estado, no siendo así el caso de las lanchas de prácticos que están en buenas condiciones.\nFlota de cabotaje\nSe cuenta con seis (6) buques RO-RO, 12 patanas, 10 de ellas destinada a la transportación de combustible y 11 remolcadores. La\nmayoría de estos medios presentan un gran deterioro causado por\nalrededor de 35 años de explotación sin una reparación adecuada.\nEn el caso de los remolcadores aunque presentan un estado\naceptable, llevan explotándose más de 40 años lo que inciden en\nsu capacidad técnica. Estos medios no son suficientes lo que motiva\nque a veces es utilizado en varios puertos, provocando mayores gastos de combustible y demoras para los barcos entrando al puerto.\n\n79\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.10.4 Transporte aéreo\nActualmente el número de vuelos totales programados publicados\npor día (llegadas y salidas) es de alrededor de 40, las cuales están\nprincipalmente concentrados durante las horas tempranas de la\nmañana y al final de la tarde, con escasos vuelos durante el día. La\ndemanda potencial para los vuelos nacionales es alta, especialmente\nentre turistas extranjeros, sin embargo como el número de naves es\nlimitado, no es posible incrementar el tráfico aéreo en las rutas\nLa flota de operación de Cubana está limitada a seis (6) pequeñas aeronaves operadas para vuelos nacionales/regionales y tres\n(3) Ilyshin IL 96 que son aeronaves de gran ancho de fuselaje para\nvuelos de largas distancias. Para rehabilitar los vuelos y remplazar\nlos aviones inmovilizados, Cubana está alquilando aeronaves (con\ny sin tripulación) de varios operadores extranjeros.\n1.10.5 Estrategias y planes del sector relacionadas\ncon la mitigación\nEntre las nuevas estrategias del sector está la promoción del uso de\nvehículos eléctricos, para lo que se ha elaborado una Propuesta de\npolítica para el uso y desarrollo perspectivo de los vehículos eléctricos en el transporte automotor 2020– 2030.\nEn estos momentos se explotan 40 ómnibus híbridos (eléctrico-Diésel) en la transportación de pasajeros en la capital, del tipo\nrígido de la firma Yutong. Funcionan con baterías eléctricas dos\ntaxis de la Empresa Taxi Cuba, una flota de 24 paneles de la Empresa Aguas de La Habana y un ómnibus operado por la Empresa\nde Ómnibus Urbano de la capital.\nSe continúa con el proceso de remotorización de los vehículos,\ncomo una forma de ahorro energético y por ende como una medida de mitigación.\nSe trabaja en el incremento de las transportaciones de pasajeros\npor ferrocarril, a partir de la adquisición de nuevos coches ferroviarios, así como el traspaso de carga del transporte automotor a\nferroviario para medianas y largas distancias.\nA escala de proyecto se trabaja en la implementación de un sistema de transporte bajo en carbono para La Habana, que permitirá evaluar y medir los resultados del mismo a partir del uso de la\nenergía eléctrica.\n\n80\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.11 Construcción\nLas principales emisiones de CO2 y partículas sólidas en este sector se derivan de la producción de materiales para la construcción (Tabla1.8). Además, en el sector están promoviendo una serie\nde acciones relacionadas con el cambio climático debido a lo cual\ncomo política está el incremento en cantidad de proyectos de investigación y como línea de deseo la introducción de tecnologías\nahorradoras de portadores energéticos (mediante paneles solares)\ny de recursos hídricos dentro de los procesos de producción industrial y de otra índole en el sector.\nTabla 1.8 Principales materiales de la construcción producidos en\nel país\nProducciones (Mt)\n2014\n2016\nCal\n51.5\n48.6\nCemento\n1,579.9\n1,492.6\n1.12 Desarrollo local\nEl desarrollo local en Cuba se asume como un proceso esencialmente endógeno, participativo, innovador y de articulación de\nintereses entre actores, territorios y escalas (municipal, provincial\ny sectorial/nacional). Se sustenta en el liderazgo de los gobiernos\nmunicipales y provinciales para la gestión de sus estrategias de\ndesarrollo dirigidas, desde la gestión del conocimiento y la innovación, al fomento de proyectos que generen transformaciones\neconómico-productivas, socioculturales, socioculturales, ambientales e institucionales, con el objetivo de elevar la calidad de vida\nde la población.\nLa visión del desarrollo territorial al 2030 se caracteriza por\nla objetividad de estrategias de desarrollo municipal y planes de\nordenamiento territorial y urbano que constituyen la base del proceso de planificación e inversión, que contribuyen a reducir las\ndesproporciones territoriales.\nEn el contexto nacional actual, se avanza hacia un proceso de\ndescentralización a partir del otorgamiento constitucional de una\nmayor autonomía municipal, con lo cual el desarrollo local adquiere mayor relevancia.\n\n81\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos municipios que se incorporan a esta perspectiva, orientan\nsu proceso de desarrollo sobre la base de su Estrategia de Desarrollo Municipal (EDM), conformada por programas y proyectos que\nresponden a políticas locales. Este instrumento rector del sistema\nde planificación a nivel municipal, se compatibiliza con el Plan\nGeneral de Ordenamiento Territorial y Urbano, lo cual propicia el\nestablecimiento de relaciones horizontales a través de la articulación multiactoral y multisectorial, permitiendo un uso más efectivo de los recursos disponibles.\nLos efectos del cambio climático tienen una expresión más concreta a escala local, pero también desde ella pueden acometerse\ngran parte de las acciones necesarias para su enfrentamiento, tanto en términos de mitigación como de adaptación, constituyendo\nuna prioridad orientada a garantizar la sostenibilidad del desarrollo. En este sentido, se promueve la inserción de este enfoque en\nlas políticas, programas y proyectos asociados a las EDM, así como\nla gestión de diversas fuentes de financiamiento para reducir las\nvulnerabilidades de cada territorio conforme a sus particularidades sociales, económicas y ambientales.\n1.13 Prioridades y objetivos de desarrollo\nLa sociedad cubana se encuentra en proceso de actualización de\nsu modelo económico y social de desarrollo socialista. En abril de\n2016, el 7mo. Congreso del Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) analizó y aprobó la Conceptualización del Modelo Económico y Social\nCubano de Desarrollo Socialista, las Bases del Plan Nacional de\nDesarrollo Económico y Social hasta el 2030: Visión de la Nación,\nEjes y Sectores Estratégicos y los Lineamientos de la Política Económica y Social del Partido y la Revolución para el período 20162021. Estos documentos fueron sometidos a un amplio proceso de\nconsulta popular y posteriormente se aprobaron por la Asamblea\nNacional del Poder Popular el 1 de junio de 2017.\nEn las Bases del PNDES hasta el 2030, se establecen seis ejes\nestratégicos, diseñados bajo un enfoque sistémico, que articulan\nla propuesta de desarrollo económico y social hasta el 2030 y\ncontribuyen, desde su área de influencia, a la consecución de ese\npropósito a largo plazo.\n\n82\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos seis ejes estratégicos son:\n1.\tGobierno socialista, eficaz, eficiente y de integración social;\n2.\tTransformación productiva e inserción internacional;\n3.\tInfraestructura;\n4.\tPotencial humano, ciencia, tecnología e innovación;\n5.\tRecursos naturales y medio ambiente\n6.\tDesarrollo humano, equidad y justicia social.\nEn torno a estos ejes estratégicos se establecen veintidós objetivos\ngenerales y ciento once objetivos específicos.\nEl planteamiento programático del país para la determinación\nde su futuro es que “La Visión de la Nación, entendida como el\nestado o situación que se desea alcanzar, se define como soberana,\nindependiente, socialista, democrática, próspera y sostenible. Entre los retos futuros que asume están los asociados a los constantes\ncambios en términos científicos, tecnológicos y climáticos”.\nCon estas premisas el modelo económico que se promueve\nconsidera vital el enfrentamiento al cambio climático y se plantea: Implementar de manera eficaz y eficiente los programas y acciones\npara el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, con énfasis en la adaptación, la reducción de la vulnerabilidad, y la introducción de estrategias\nsistémicas e intersectoriales, así como, Elevar la eficiencia energética y\nel desarrollo de fuentes renovables de energía, lo que contribuye, entre\notros beneficios, a reducir la generación de gases de efecto invernadero, a\nmitigar el cambio climático y a promover un desarrollo económico menos\nintenso en carbono.\nPara cumplir sus metas de desarrollo y de enfrentamiento al\ncambio climático, Cuba, como muchos países en vías de desarrollo, se enfrenta a gigantescos desafíos económicos, a lo cual se\nsuma la aplicación y el recrudecimiento de la política de bloqueo\neconómico, comercial y financiero impuesto por el gobierno de\nEstados Unidos por casi 60 años, que le impide acceder a financiamientos de las principales instituciones financieras internacionales\ny además, mantiene una férrea persecución financiera a aquellos\nrecursos a los que el país ha podido acceder, o a sus transacciones\nfinancieras resultado de su comercio exterior. El bloqueo impide al país acceder a tecnologías, equipamientos y conocimientos\ncientíficos y técnicos requeridos, para su desarrollo sostenible.\nMás recientemente el bloqueo ha continuado recrudeciéndose\ncon la aplicación del Título III de la Ley Helms-Burton, que ataca\nla libertad de comercio y refuerza el carácter extraterritorial de las\n\n83\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsanciones contra Cuba, además de dañar las relaciones económicas y comerciales del país con la Comunidad Internacional.\nLa política de bloqueo constituye el principal obstáculo al\ndesarrollo económico de Cuba y, por ende, a la implementación\ndel PNDES 2030, la Agenda 2030 y sus ODS, la Tarea Vida y las\nNDC.\n1.14 Prioridades relacionadas con la mitigación\ndel cambio climático\nLa contribución de Cuba a las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero es mínima y no rebasa el 0.08 %. No obstante, Cuba\nha realizado esfuerzos importantes en la reducción de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. Fue uno de los primeros países\nen el mundo en iniciar el reemplazo de las bombillas incandescentes (2005), y ha mantenido desde 1959 un incremento sostenido de\nsu cubierta boscosa.\nLa mitigación es apreciada en las políticas nacionales como una\ndimensión esencial del desarrollo que contribuye a la modernización y el desarrollo tecnológico sobre bases de sostenibilidad, al\nfortalecimiento de sus capacidades, la mejora de la efectividad y\neficiencia de los procesos al disminuir el consumo de portadores\nenergéticos de origen fósil, a un uso de tecnologías más eficientes,\na una mejor gestión de los residuos, entre otros elementos importantes y transversales a toda la actividad económica del país.\nCuba produce cerca del 96 % de su energía eléctrica a partir del\nempleo de combustibles fósiles, con una alta dependencia de la\nimportación, elevados costos de generación y una infraestructura\ntecnológica de altas emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero.\nEn respuesta a estas coyunturas, el Consejo de Ministros aprobó\nen 2014 la “Política para el Desarrollo Perspectivo de las Fuentes\nRenovables y el Uso Eficiente de la Energía”, dirigida a aprovechar\nal máximo los recursos renovables disponibles en el país.\nEl Plan Nacional de Desarrollo Económico y Social al 2030\n(PNDES 2030), introduce por primera vez en las políticas públicas\ndel país, el concepto de un desarrollo menos intenso en emisiones\nde gases de efecto invernadero.\nEl 25 de abril de 2017 el Consejo de Ministros aprobó el Plan de\nEstado para el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, conocido también como Tarea Vida. Este Plan tiene un alcance y jerarquía superiores a todos los documentos elaborados anteriormente sobre\n\n84\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\neste tema, además de actualizarlos e incluir la dimensión territorial. El Plan requiere concebir y ejecutar un programa de inversiones progresivas, a corto (2020), mediano (2030), largo (2050) y\nmuy largo plazos (2100).\nEn la “Tarea Vida” aparece una referencia particular a la mitigación y a su implementación en 12 sectores claves del desarrollo:\nseguridad alimentaria, energía renovable, eficiencia energética, ordenamiento territorial y urbano, pesca, agropecuaria, salud, turismo,\nconstrucción, transporte, industria y manejo integral de los bosques.\nEs importante considerar que, desde el punto de vista legal,\nCuba asume compromisos de mitigación, bajo la CMNUCC y el\nAcuerdo de París.\nCuba es parte de la CMNUCC, desde el cinco de marzo de 1994\ny es parte del Protocolo de Kioto desde julio de 2002. Firmó el\nAcuerdo de París el 22 de abril de 2016 y lo ratificó en enero de\n2017. Al ser parte de estos instrumentos internacionales, Cuba adquiere las responsabilidades que derivan de lo dispuesto en ellos.\nCuba presentó su propuesta de Contribución Nacionalmente\nDeterminada (INDC por sus siglas en inglés) el 23 de noviembre\ndel 2015, la cual se convirtió automáticamente en su CND al ratificar el Acuerdo de París. En ella se incluyen contribuciones en\nadaptación, reconocida como prioridad y contribuciones en mitigación. Las CND comunicadas por Cuba están en concordancia\ncon el Plan de Estado para el Enfrentamiento al Cambio Climático\n(Tarea Vida) y con el Programa de Desarrollo Económico y Social\ndel país al 2030 (PNDES 2030).\nSin embargo, mientras que la actual Contribución Nacionalmente Determinada (CND) de Cuba (2015) se concentra en el\nsector de la energía, con un peso importante en las energías renovables, el Plan de Estado amplía las exigencias de la mitigación\na otras políticas sectoriales, incluyendo el sector agropecuario,\nel turismo, la construcción, el transporte, la industria y el manejo de los bosques (Tarea 8), lo cual es potenciado por el llamado a “la promoción de un desarrollo menos intenso en carbono”,\nen las Bases del Plan de Desarrollo Económico y Social al 2030,\nesta extensión de las acciones de mitigación, incluye iniciativas\nvinculadas al uso de la bioenergía, la promoción de la movilidad\nsostenible, el papel de los bosques en la remoción de carbono y la\npromoción de estrategias de desarrollo bajo en carbono.\n\n85\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.15 Arreglos institucionales relativos\na la preparación del Primer Informe Bienal\nde Actualización de Cuba\nLa República de Cuba presenta su Primer Informe Bienal de Actualización (IBA) a la Convención Marco de Naciones Unidas sobre\nCambio Climático (CMNUCC). El IBA se ha elaborado con el apoyo financiero del Fondo para el Medio Ambiente Mundial (FMAM)\ny está siendo implementado por el Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología y Medio Ambiente, con el apoyo del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD).\nEl Primer IBA se elaboró bajo las Directrices de la CMNUCC\npara los IBA de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención adoptadas en la 17 Conferencia de las Partes (Anexo III de la\nDecisión 2/CP.17).\nPor la parte cubana, el Centro de Gestión de la Información y\nDesarrollo de la Energía (CUBAENERGÍA), bajo la coordinación\ngeneral del Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología y Medio Ambiente,\ncoordinó, a nivel técnico-ejecutivo, las actividades fundamentales\ncon los organismos y entidades nacionales para la conformación\ndel IBA. La elaboración del IBA se desarrolló en el marco y con el\napoyo del proyecto Tercera Comunicación y Primer Informe Bienal de\nActualización, financiado por el FMAM, con el acompañamiento\ndel PNUD como entidad implementadora y el INSMET como entidad ejecutora cubana.\nEl informe contiene una recopilación de los principales elementos de las circunstancias nacionales con mayor influencia en\nlas emisiones y remociones de GEI y en las acciones de mitigación,\nel inventario nacional de gases de efecto invernadero (INGEI) con\nbase en los datos del año 2016, la información sobre las acciones\nde mitigación, el estado de desarrollo e implementación del sistema MRV y el apoyo recibido y el requerido.\nPara la ejecución de todo el trabajo fue necesario de una coordinación muy estrecha de muchas instituciones nacionales. Un esquema general de los arreglos institucionales para la elaboración\ndel IBA se muestra en la figura 1.13.\nCada uno de los OACEs y ENs designaron funcionarios y especialistas para la conformación de los equipos técnicos que trabajaron cada uno de los capítulos del IBA.\n\n86\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos equipos técnicos estuvieron integrados por funcionarios\ny especialistas de los ministerios y entidades nacionales como el\nMINEM, MINAG, MITRANS, MINDUS, ONEI, IPF, INRH; por entidades y empresas como la UNE, ONURE, CUBAENERGÍA, UH,\nINAF, GEGAN, EIIP, INSMET, CIMAB.\nLa información requerida fue suministrada por la ONEI, por\nlos sistemas estadísticos complementarios de los organismos y por\nentidades y empresas. La coordinación para la elaboración del capítulo 2, referido al INGEI se realizó por el Equipo Técnico del\nINGEI del INSMET. La coordinación para la elaboración del resto\nde los capítulos se llevó a cabo por el Grupo de Cambio Climático\nde CUBAENERGÍA. La redacción final del informe se llevó a cabo\npor CUBAENERGÍA.\nFigura 1.13 Esquema general de los arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del IBA. Fuente: Equipo técnico mitigación CUBAENERGÍA.\nEl trabajo se inició en el año 2017 con un taller, donde participaron\nespecialistas y funcionarios de los organismos, entidades nacionales, centros académicos, universidades, instituciones proveedoras\nde datos e información, todos vinculados a las emisiones y remociones de gases de efecto invernadero y a las acciones de mitigación. Con ese taller quedaron esclarecidos los principales objetivos\ndel trabajo para la elaboración del IBA, las principales actividades\n\n87\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\na abordar y los principales resultados a obtener. En lo fundamental\nquedaron definidos los principales roles y responsabilidades de las\ninstituciones para la conformación del IBA.\nA partir de ese momento se efectuaron un total de 6 talleres,\ncon la participación de los principales especialistas y funcionarios\nvinculados con la elaboración del IBA, donde se iban exponiendo\nlos resultados obtenidos y la marcha de las actividades principales.\nEn los períodos intermedios de los talleres se efectuaron más de\n20 reuniones técnicas con las instituciones involucradas para tratar aspectos específicos del trabajo. En tres ocasiones la marcha del\ntrabajo de elaboración del IBA fue expuesto en el Grupo Nacional\nde Cambio Climático, que dirige la ministra del CITMA y donde\nparticipan representantes de los ministros del resto de los ministerios. Estas reuniones fueron muy importantes para socializar el\ntrabajo, intercambiar experiencias y tomar decisiones importantes\npara dar impulso al trabajo que se desarrollaba.\nUna vez concluida la etapa técnica, el IBA pasó a un nivel de\nconsulta amplio, bajo la coordinación de la ministra del CITMA,\ncon la participación de los representantes de los Jefes de todos los\nOACE y EN implicados. Finalmente, el IBA fue aprobado por el\nGobierno.\n\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nDE LA REPÚBLICA DE CUBA\n\n89\n2. Inventario Nacional de Gases de\nEfecto Invernadero\n2.1 Introducción\nDando cumplimiento al Artículo 4, párrafo 1a y al Artículo 12, párrafo 1a de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre\nCambio Climático (en lo adelante CMNUCC), Cuba en el marco de\ndos comunicaciones nacionales, ha presentado el reporte de emisiones y absorciones de gases de efecto invernadero (en lo adelante\nGEI) para los años pares de la serie 1990-2002 con las actualizaciones correspondientes (Tabla 2.1).\nTabla 2.1 Inventarios Nacionales de GEI de Cuba comunicados a la\nCMNUCC\nReporte\nAño de entrega\nAños incluidos en el INGEI\nPrimera Comunicación Nacional\n2001\n1990,1994\nSegunda Comunicación Nacional\n2015\nAños pares Serie 1990-2002\n(actualizaciones de 1990,1994)\nFuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.\nEn la 16 Conferencia de las Partes (COP16) con el propósito de\nreportar los avances en la implementación de los objetivos de la\nCMNUCC se estableció que los países en desarrollo deben entregar Informes Bienales de Actualización (IBA) con información actualizada sobre\nlos inventarios nacionales de gases de efecto invernadero18 (en lo adelante INGEI).\nPosteriormente, en la COP17 de 2011 se definió que los países en desarrollo deberían presentar su primer IBA (…) abarcando, como\nmínimo, un año civil anterior en no más de cuatro años a la fecha de\npresentación.19\n18 Decisión 1, párrafo 60(c) del Informe de la Conferencia de las Partes sobre su 16º período\nde sesiones, celebrado en Cancún del 29 de noviembre al 10 de diciembre de 2010.\n19 Decisión 1, párrafo 41(a) Informe de la Conferencia de las Partes sobre su 17º período de\nsesiones, celebrado en Durban del 28 de noviembre al 11 de diciembre de 2011.\n\n90\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nPara la elaboración de estos documentos los equipos técnicos de\nINGEI de los países se basan en las siguientes guías metodológicas:\n• Directrices de la Convención para los IBA de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención (Anexo III de la Decisión 2/CP.17)\n• Directrices para la elaboración de las Comunicaciones Nacionales de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención\n(Anexo de la Decisión 17/CP.8)\nCuba, simultáneamente con su 3CN, presenta su primer IBA, que\nincluye el INGEI para el año 2016 y la serie 1990-2016. El inventario se elaboró siguiendo las Directrices del Panel Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (Directrices del\nIPCC 2006) según la disponibilidad de datos de actividad para los\ncálculos y siguiendo los principios de transparencia, exhaustividad, coherencia, comparabilidad y exactitud.\nAbarca todo el territorio nacional e incluye las emisiones y absorciones de GEI de origen antropogénico no controlados por el\nProtocolo de Montreal. En este capítulo se describe el proceso llevado a cabo para la elaboración del INGEI, la metodología empleada, los resultados de las emisiones y absorciones de GEI del\npaís, así como las actualizaciones y mejoras incorporadas respecto\na reportes anteriores, entre otros aspectos relacionados con el reporte de los inventarios nacionales de GEI.\nEn la Tercera Comunicación Nacional (TCN) también se incluye un reporte de este capítulo para la misma serie de tiempo.\n2.1.1 Arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del\ninventario\nDesde mediados de la década de 1990 el INSMET coordina la elaboración y presentación del INGEI, bajo la responsabilidad de un\n“Equipo Técnico de Gases de Efecto Invernadero” (ETGEI). Este\nequipo lo lidera un Coordinador General y está integrado por expertos del INSMET y de los equipos de trabajo de cada sector involucrado en el inventario. El ETGEI responde por la elaboración,\nverificación, validación, y actualización sistemática del INGEI, la\npreparación de los informes para las comunicaciones nacionales y\nlos IBA, y por la información que requiera el Sistema Nacional de\nInformación y Estadística.\n\n91\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas instituciones que participan en la elaboración del INGEI\npertenecen a los ministerios relacionados con los sectores que generan las emisiones y las absorciones de GEI; también participan\nautoridades ambientales, instituciones públicas, académicas y productivas. Entre los participantes es relevante la Oficina Nacional de\nEstadísticas e Información (ONEI), institución transversal para todos los sectores, que compila y certifica los datos oficiales del país.\nLas instituciones involucradas con el inventario proveen datos\nde actividad, así como paramétricos y específicos necesarios para\nlas estimaciones. Por otra parte, aportan juicio de expertos, certificación de datos y revisión de informes, como parte del control de\nla calidad, exhaustividad y transparencia requeridos. Lo anterior\npermite refinar las estadísticas nacionales y determinar factores de\nemisión propios de país.\nLos sectores incluidos en el inventario, según las Directrices del\nIPCC de 2006 son: Energía, Procesos Industriales y Uso de Productos (IPPU por sus siglas en inglés), Agricultura, Silvicultura y Otros\nUsos de la Tierra (AFOLU, por sus siglas en inglés) y Desechos.\nLos arreglos institucionales del INGEI se muestran en la figura 2.1.\n Figura 2.1 Arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del INGEI en Cuba. Fuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.20\n20 Se ha comenzado a trabajar según estos arreglos, en correspondencia con lo propuesto\nen las Bases Generales del Sistema MRV del país, que deberá ser formalizado en el futuro.\n\n92\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.1.2 Proceso de preparación del Inventario\nLa elaboración del INGEI contempla una serie de actividades que\nse realizan de manera cíclica, comenzando cada vez que se hace\nnecesario actualizar el inventario para ser sometido a revisión por\nexpertos de la CMNUCC para los IBA y las CN.\nLa duración del ciclo del inventario depende de las circunstancias y los requerimientos de los informes nacionales. El diagrama\ndel ciclo del inventario, que se muestra en la figura 2.2, comprende\nseis ciclos de diferente duración en los cuales se exponen las actividades fundamentales para la elaboración del INGEI.

Para la\nestimación de la incertidumbre se tienen en cuenta además las\norientaciones del IPCC contenidas en las Directrices de buenas prácticas (GPG, 2000). La implementación de las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006 constituye un paso significativo respecto a reportes anteriores en los cuales se seguían fundamentalmente las Guías Revisadas\ndel IPCC de 1996.\nSe incluyen las emisiones y absorciones nacionales anuales de\nla serie 1990-2016 para los cuatro sectores contemplados en las\nDirectrices del IPCC de 2006.\n2.1.3.1 Metodologías\nLas metodologías utilizadas para compilar los datos de cada sector\nson comparables, lo que posibilita la comparabilidad de los resultados obtenidos. En cada sector, se incluyeron las categorías y subcategorías fuentes de emisiones y absorciones existentes en el país\nen las cuales se contó con la información necesaria para realizar\nlas estimaciones correspondientes al nivel de desagregación de las\nDirectrices del IPCC de 2006. Algunas categorías y subcategorías no\nfueron estimadas por la falta de datos de actividad.\nTomando en consideración la disponibilidad de datos de actividad, la información sobre los factores de emisión y los parámetros\nnecesarios para las estimaciones, se aplicaron, fundamentalmente,\nmétodos de Nivel 1, con factores de emisión por defecto y datos\nde actividad generados por instituciones nacionales. En algunas\nfuentes se aplicaron métodos de Nivel 2, con factores de emisión\npropios de país y por defecto. Estos métodos de estimación son:\nMétodo de Nivel 1: Es el “método por defecto”, la instancia metodológica más simple, aplicable cuando no se cuenta con datos de\nactividad propios o factores de emisión país específicos. Si bien el\nmétodo Nivel 1 permite hacer el cálculo, tiene el riesgo de que las\ncircunstancias nacionales no sean debidamente reflejadas.\n\n96\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nMétodo de Nivel 2: Se basa en el mismo procedimiento metodológico del Nivel 1, pero con factores de emisión o datos de actividad paramétricos propios del país o de una región. En estas\ncircunstancias, es altamente probable que las estimaciones de absorciones y emisiones de GEI sean más precisas, por lo cual esta\nopción debiera aplicarse a las categorías principales.\nMétodo Nivel 3: Corresponde a métodos específicos de un país\n(modelos, mediciones in situ censos y otros), cuya aplicación se\nrecomienda siempre que hayan sido debidamente validados.\nLos cálculos se realizaron a partir de la ecuación base que se muestra a continuación utilizando el software del IPCC del 2006 y hojas\nde cálculo desarrolladas por el ETGEI en base a las Directrices del\nIPCC, 2006.\nEcuación 2.1. Método de cálculo de las emisiones de GEI.\nEmisiones=Datos Actividad (DA) *Factor de Emisión (FE)\nTras estimar las emisiones y absorciones de cada GEI en las diversas fuentes se reportan los valores de GEI en forma agregada,\nexpresados en dióxido de carbono equivalente (CO2eq). Fueron\nusados los Potenciales de Calentamiento Global (PCG o GWP por\nsus siglas en inglés) proporcionados por el IPCC en su Segundo Informe de Evaluación en 1995 (SAR por sus siglas en ingles), que se\nbasan en los efectos de los GEI en un horizonte temporal de cien\naños. La tabla 2.3 muestra dichos PCG para los tres GEI estimados\nen el INGEI.\nTabla 2.3 Potenciales de calentamiento global de los GEI directos\nGas\nFórmula Química\n Potencial de Calentamiento\nGlobal a 100 años\nDióxido de Carbono\nCO2\n1\nMetano\nCH4\n21\nÓxido Nitroso\nN2O\n310\nFuente: Segundo Informe de Evaluación del IPCC (SAR, 1995)\n\n97\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.1.3.2 Datos de actividad\nLos datos de actividad provienen de diferentes fuentes teniendo\nen cuenta los sectores del INGEI. La información primaria utilizada proviene de los Anuarios Estadísticos publicados por la ONEI,\nsin embargo, en la actualidad, estos datos cubren solamente solo\nuna parte de la información necesaria para realizar las estimaciones, por lo que se solicita información a los diferentes ministerios\ne instituciones (según figura 2.1) ya que estas no son publicadas por\nla ONEI. A continuación, se describen de forma general las principales fuentes de información para cada sector.\nSector Energía. La ONEI y el Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MINEM) son las dos principales fuentes de información sobre datos\nde actividad (consumo y producción de combustibles) en el país.\nDichas instituciones son las encargadas de la elaboración del Balance Energético Nacional (BEN) en el cual se encuentra la información de producción, oferta interna y consumo nacional de todos los\ncombustibles por los diferentes sectores económicos del país.\nSe obtuvo además, información complementaria desde el Centro de Gestión y Desarrollo de la Energía (CUBAENERGÍA), el\nCentro de Investigaciones y Manejo Ambiental del Transporte (CIMAB), el Ministerio de Transporte (MITRANS), el Ministerio de\nIndustrias (MINDUS), el Grupo Empresarial AZCUBA, el Ministerio de la Agricultura (MINAG), el Ministerio de la Construcción\n(MICONS), así como otras pertenecientes al MINEM.\nSector IPPU. Se cuenta con datos de actividad estadísticos fundamentalmente de producción de diversas sustancias publicados\npor la ONEI, además de otros datos de actividad y paramétricos\nmás refinados aportados por el Ministerio de la Construcción (MICONS), por el Ministerio de Industrias (MINDUS), por el Centro\nde Investigaciones de la Industria Química (CIIQ) y el Grupo Empresarial de la Industria Sideromecánica (GESIME). A partir de esta\ninformación más detallada fue posible la aplicación de un método\nde Nivel 2 en algunas fuentes de emisión. Además, por medio de\ncriterio de expertos se determinó la No Ocurrencia (NO) para algunas subcategorías de la Industria Química.\nSector AFOLU. Se utilizaron varias fuentes de información, tanto\nde datos estadísticos como paramétricos. En la ONEI se publica\nuna cantidad significativa de información referente a la ganade-\n\n98\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nría y a los cultivos en Cuba, con datos certificados por el MINAG\ny sus instituciones especializadas, incluido el Grupo Empresarial\nGanadero (GEGAN). Diversos datos paramétricos de alimentación\ny sistemas de manejo del ganado fueron provistos por otras instituciones académicas del Ministerio de Educación Superior (MES),\ncomo el Instituto de Ciencia Animal (ICA), y la Estación Experimental de Pastos y Forrajes Indio Hatuey (EEPFIH).\nEl aporte de estas entidades, de conjunto con un grupo de expertos\ninternacionales,22 fue determinante en la refinación de los datos de\nactividad referentes a poblaciones ganaderas, alimentación animal\ny manejo del estiércol del ganado en el país para la estimación de\nlas emisiones en las categorías 3.A Ganadería y 3.C Fuentes agregadas\ny fuentes de emisión no CO2 de la tierra.\nLos datos de las categorías forestales se obtuvieron desde el\nInstituto de Investigaciones Agroforestales (INAF) perteneciente al\nGrupo Agroforestal del MINAG. Se obtuvieron además datos estadísticos y paramétricos desde el Instituto de Suelos (IS) y para\nel caso del cultivo del arroz criterios de expertos procedentes del\nInstituto de Investigaciones de Granos (IIG).\nSector Desechos. Las fuentes de datos de actividad y paramétricos\nde mayor importancia son la ONEI la cual publica toda la información estadística referente a la cantidad de población en el país; las\nEmpresas de Servicios Comunales y el Ministerio de Economía y\nPlanificación (MEP) que tributan datos referentes a la generación\nde desechos sólidos; el Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidráulicos (INRH) que provee información concerniente a los sistemas de\nmanejo de aguas residuales tanto domésticas como industriales.\nOtra fuente de información en este sector la constituye el MINDUS para el caso de las aguas residuales industriales.\nPartidas informativas\nComo parte del módulo de energía, también se estimaron los elementos\ninformativos referentes a Bunkers internacionales y Emisiones de CO2\npor quema de biomasa, que se muestran en el Anexo 3.\nComo buena práctica, se realizó la estimación de las emisiones\nde GEI por 1.A. Quema de combustibles por el método de referencia.\nEn el Anexo 4 se presentan los resultados obtenidos.\n22 En julio de 2019 se realizó en La Habana un Taller de fortalecimiento de capacidades para\nel sector AFOLU del INGEI de Cuba con la participación de varios expertos internacionales.\n\n99\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.1.3.3 Factores de emisión\nLos factores de emisión utilizados en su mayoría, fueron por defecto de nivel 1 tomados de las Directrices del IPPC de 2006.\nSector Energía. Para el cálculo de las emisiones de CO2, CH4 y\nN2O para las subcategorías del grupo 1.A. Quema de combustibles y\nsubcategorías del grupo 1.B. Emisiones Fugitivas se emplearon factores de emisión por defecto de Nivel 1. Aunque se han realizado\nestudios de factores de emisión propios para los diferentes combustibles del país, estos aún están pendientes de revisión y ajustes,\npor lo que se utilizaron los factores procedentes de las Directrices\ndel IPCC de 2006. Para el próximo ciclo del INGEI se utilizarán\nlos factores de emisión propios por tipo de combustible en el país.\nSector IPPU. Los factores de emisión empleados en este sector\npertenecientes a las categorías 2.A. Industria de los Minerales, 2.B.\nIndustria Química y 2.C. Industria de los metales fueron por defecto de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 tanto para Nivel 1 como\nNivel 2. Solamente en el caso de las emisiones relacionadas con la\nProducción de cemento fue posible obtener un factor de emisión\npropio de país para cada año de la serie aplicándose un método de\nNivel 2.\nSector AFOLU. Se utilizaron, en mayoría, factores de emisión\npor defecto provenientes de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nSin embargo, para la subcategoría 3.A.1 Fermentación entérica se\nutilizaron factores de emisión propios de país mediante juicio de\nexpertos del sector en Cuba, expertos asesores de Colombia y el\nETGEI de Cuba en el taller realizado.\nSector Desechos. Para este sector se utilizó el método de descomposición de primer orden (FOD, por sus siglas en inglés) de acuerdo con las Directrices del IPCC de 2006, manteniendo algunos\nparámetros por defecto y agregando datos específicos de país. Para\nel caso de las aguas residuales tanto domésticas como industriales\nse utilizaron factores de emisión por defecto provenientes de las\nDirectrices del IPCC 2006.\nLas metodologías y fuentes de información empleadas para la estimación de las emisiones de GEI por componentes, subcategorías, subsectores y sectores se muestran en el Anexo 1.\n\n100\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos métodos y criterios metodológicos utilizados para la estimación del INGEI de Cuba, serie 1990-2016 se muestran en el\nAnexo 2 (emisiones provenientes de las diferentes categorías y\nsubcategorías de fuente, tanto para los datos de actividad, factores\nde emisión y los diferentes GEI según las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006).\n2.1.4 Evaluación de la incertidumbre\nLa información sobre incertidumbres, no está destinada a disputar\nla validez de los estimados del inventario, sino para ayudar a priorizar los esfuerzos para mejorar la seguridad de este en el futuro y\nguiar las decisiones acerca de las elecciones metodológicas.\nAunque, para la mayor parte de los países y categorías de fuentes, los estimados de emisiones de gases de invernadero son razonablemente seguros, los reportes del inventario preparados\nutilizando las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 normalmente contienen un amplio rango de estimados de emisiones con diferente\ngrado de calidad.\nSegún las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 y sus orientaciones sobre\nbuenas prácticas y gestión de incertidumbre, la propagación de\nerror (Método 1) y el método de Montecarlo (Método 2) son los\nmétodos más utilizados para la estimación de la incertidumbre de\nemisiones.\nLa serie temporal de inventarios reportada en este IBA utiliza\nsolamente el método 1 de propagación de errores que supone que\nlos errores son pequeños y simétricos, requiere de la determinación\nde expresiones matemáticas de la varianza de una estimación. Estas\nexpresiones a veces resultan ser relativamente extensas y complejas\ny, por tanto, son propensas a errores humanos de cálculo.\nEn la sección 2.4 se presenta el resultado del análisis de la estimación de las incertidumbres para este INGEI.\n2.1.5 Análisis de categorías clave\nLas Directrices del IPCC de 2006 establecen dos criterios para la\nidentificación de categorías clave. Cada uno contempla dos análisis:\n• La evaluación del nivel, en la cual se evalúa la influencia de\ncada una de las emisiones en cada categoría con respecto a las\nemisiones totales en el último año del inventario, y\n\n101\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n• La evaluación de tendencia, en la cual se evalúa el aporte del\ncambio de emisiones de cada categoría en el cambio de emisiones o absorciones totales, entre el último año y un año de\nreferencia.\nExisten dos métodos para cada criterio de evaluación (el método 2,\na diferencia del método 1, integra en el análisis el valor de la incertidumbre como criterio de selección).\nPara la selección de las categorías claves del inventario nacional\nde emisiones GEI para la serie 1990-2016, se llevaron a cabo los\ncuatro análisis disponibles apoyados en la herramienta de cálculo\npara categorías claves versión 2.5 procedentes de las Directrices\ndel IPCC de 2006. En la sección 2.5 se muestra un análisis más\ndetallado de las categorías claves.\nTabla 2.4 Métodos y ecuaciones utilizados para la determinación\nde categorías clave\nMétodo 1\nNivel\nEcuación 4.1, volumen 1, capítulo\n4.

No obstante, para la\nelaboración del correspondiente a la serie 1990-2016, se han llevado a cabo acciones encaminadas a mejorar y establecer una ruta de\ntrabajo que garantice la permanencia en el tiempo del análisis, la\ngestión y el aseguramiento de la calidad. Estos procesos de control\ny aseguramiento de la calidad (QA/QC, por sus siglas en inglés)\n\n102\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\ndotan al inventario de una mayor consistencia y certidumbre en\nsus resultados. El control y el análisis están dirigidos a mejorar la\ncalidad de entrada de los datos de actividad y a la verificación de\nlos factores de emisión utilizados.\nEs un proceso continuo que comienza con el análisis de las categorías estimadas y no estimadas. Las categorías que no se han\npodido estimar, por falta de datos de actividad o de las metodologías apropiadas, y las que se certificaron que no ocurren en el país\nse han reportado usando claves de notación en el Anexo 2.\nComo parte del proceso de control de calidad una vez concluidos los informes de cada sector, se compartieron con expertos\nsectoriales, con el objetivo de esclarecer y revisar las estimaciones\nrealizadas. Este proceso contribuyó a mejorar la calidad de los informes, a certificar la información contenida en los mismos y a la\npresentación de los resultados en el primer IBA.\nEn la tabla 2.26 de la sección 2.6, como parte del plan de mejoramiento, se presentan determinadas acciones que responden a un\nproceso más riguroso de control de la calidad en el INGEI del país.\n2.2 Tendencia de las emisiones agregadas por\nsectores para la serie 1990-2016.\nLas emisiones totales brutas en 2016 se contabilizaron en 50,213.7\nktCO2eq., (tabla 2.7 y figura 2.3). Las absorciones de CO2 fueron de\n27,147.2 ktCO2eq., dando como resultado unas 23,066.5 ktCO2eq. de\nemisiones netas (tabla 2.8 y figura 2.4), disminuyendo en un 39.7 %\ndesde 1990 y en 4.7 % desde 2014.\nTabla 2.5 Emisiones y absorciones de GEI (ktCO2eq.) por sectores\n(excluye FOLU), para años seleccionados del período 1990-2016\nSectores\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n1- Energía\n33294.02\n31199.25\n36051.46\n34731.22\n36134.11\n35411.94\n2- IPPU\n2943.46\n958.37\n1032.84\n1093.53\n844.91\n776.32\n3- Agricultura\n15121.57\n10807.14\n9769.76\n9895.47\n10100.40\n10109.44\n4- Desechos\n3138.51\n2907.03\n3432.04\n3537.05\n3770.55\n3915.96\nTotal\n54497.55\n45871.80\n50286.10\n49257.28\n50849.98\n50213.66\nFuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.\n\n103\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.6 Emisiones y absorciones de GEI (ktCO2eq.) por sectores\n(incluye FOLU), para años seleccionados del período 1990-2016\nSectores\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n1- Energía\n33294.02\n31199.25\n36051.46\n34731.22\n36134.11\n35411.94\n2- IPPU\n2943.46\n958.37\n1032.84\n1093.53\n844.91\n776.32\n3- AFOLU\n-1113.02\n-7470.84\n-14283.91\n-14273.39\n-16554.12\n-17037.76\n4- Desechos\n3138.51\n2907.03\n3432.04\n3537.05\n3770.55\n3915.96\nBalance\n38262.96\n27593.82\n26232.43\n25088.42\n24195.46\n23066.46\nFuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.\nFigura 2.3 Emisiones y absorciones de GEI (ktCO2eq.) por sectores (excluye\nFOLU), para la serie 1990-2016.

En el mismo año, las\nemisiones de GEI del sector contabilizaron 35,411.9 ktCO2eq., incrementándose en un 6.4 % desde 1990 y disminuyendo en un 2 %\ndesde el 2014.\nEste incremento se debe, fundamentalmente, al aumento del\nconsumo energético, incluyendo el uso de diésel y de gas natural para la generación eléctrica, así como la utilización de combustibles líquidos para transporte terrestre, mayormente diésel\ny gasolina. La disminución con respecto al 2014 fue consecuencia de los bajos niveles de refinación de petróleo en el año 2016,\ndonde se refinó un 18.5 % menos de combustibles con respecto\nal 2014.\nEn cuanto a las categorías generales del sector, en 2016, el 87.9\n% de las emisiones de GEI correspondieron a la categoría 1.A.

La subcategoría 1.A.1. Industrias de la energía es\nla principal emisora representando el 60.2 % de las emisiones\ndel sector y la componente Generación de electricidad como\nactividad principal representa el 43.3 % de las emisiones entre\ntodas las componentes y subcategorías, considerándose como la\nmás importante tanto en el resto de la serie como en el 2016.\n23 El proyecto ENERGAS, empresa mixta entre operada con capital cubano de Cuba a través\nde la Unión CUPET y la UNE y capital de Canadá por medio de la Sherrit International.\nDisponible en https://www.sherritt.com/English/operations/power/default.aspx.\n\n113\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nEsto se debe a que en el país prácticamente toda la electricidad se\ngenera en centrales termoeléctricas, baterías de motores que consumen diésel y fuel oíl y motores de emergencia a base de diésel. A\npartir del año 2006, el país llevó a cabo un proceso conocido como\nla “Revolución Energética” en el que se llevaron a cabo varias acciones en aras de mejorar el sistema eléctrico nacional, con la entrada\nde una mayor cantidad de plantas generadoras y nuevas tecnologías\nde generación en algunas de las termoeléctricas del país.\nA partir de 2007 comienza un convenio de colaboración con la\nRepública Bolivariana de Venezuela (CUVENPETROL), para refinar grandes cantidades24 de carburantes en la Refinería de Cienfuegos al centro de la isla, por ello las elevadas emisiones en los\naños 2007 y 2008 respectivamente.\nLas emisiones de las 1.A.2. Industrias manufactureras y de la\nconstrucción representaron el 16.3 %. Esta subcategoría comprende tres tipos de industrias principales desagregadas en (Industria\nazucarera, Explotación de minas y canteras y Construcción). Las\ndemás industrias se agregaron en la componente Otras industrias\nmanufactureras. Si bien la esfera industrial en el país sufrió un\ndecrecimiento a inicios del período analizado, en la actualidad se\nencuentra en segundo lugar en cuanto a emisiones del sector se\nrefiere. Aunque aún no se rebasan las emisiones del año base, las\nnuevas inversiones y la elevación de los niveles de producción nacional requeridos, producirán un aumento de las emisiones en el\nsector a corto plazo.\nLas emisiones fugitivas de la subcategoría 1.B.2. Petróleo y Gas\nNatural alcanzaron el 12.1 %, experimentando un crecimiento continuo sobre todo a partir de 1997, cuando se comienzan a explotar\nlos yacimientos en la costa norte occidental del país y se crea la\nempresa mixta ENERGAS, la entrada de plantas de ciclo combinado para la generación eléctrica y el creciente consumo de gas en\nel sector residencial, han sido las principales causas del aumento\nen los consumos de gas natural y petróleo crudo cubano y con ello\nun aumento en las emisiones fugitivas asociadas a las actividades\nextractivas.\nEl 1.A.3. Transporte (principalmente el Transporte terrestre)\nemitió el 6.2 %. Este es uno de los sectores que más ha reducido las\nemisiones desde 1990, cuando representaba el 23 % de las emisiones de la categoría y el 22.3 % de las emisiones del sector Energía.\n24 La renovación de la refinería de Cienfuegos se encontraba inactiva y la inversión venezolana llevara su capacidad de producción a unos 50000b/pd (Feinberg, 2011).\n\n114\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nEste gran decrecimiento en las emisiones tiene su causa principal en la crisis experimentada por el país a inicios de la década de\nlos 90, y, posteriormente por el recrudecimiento del bloqueo estadounidense, que trajo consigo un deterioro en todas las ramas del\ntransporte, desplomándose de manera casi total la flota marítima\ny ferroviaria del país. En el transporte por carretera y la aviación\nlos impactos fueron menores, pero también tuvieron sus consecuencias, los bajos niveles de consumo de combustibles, por la disminución de vehículos circulando en el país, y la disminución del\ntransporte aéreo de cabotaje, incidieron de manera importante en\nlas reducciones de las emisiones hacia finales del período analizado.\nPor último, el sector denominado 1.A.4. Otros sectores (principalmente Residencial) representó el 5.3 % de las emisiones totales.\nDentro de este sector también se ha registrado un descenso en las\nemisiones, sobre todo en el sector residencial que representaba en\n1990, el 7.1 % de las emisiones totales de la subcategoría y en 2016\nsolo el 2.4 %.\nEste marcado decrecimiento es debido, casi en su totalidad, a la\nreducción en los consumos combustibles líquidos en los hogares,\ncomo el querosene y la sustitución de este por gas licuado de petróleo y cocinas de inducción que utilizan electricidad. Los componentes Comercial/Institucional y Agricultura/Silvicultura y Pesca,\nmantuvieron un comportamiento similar en toda la serie.

En 2016 las emisiones del sector llegaron a 776.3 ktCO2eq., representando el 1.6 %\nde las emisiones totales del país excluyendo FOLU, estos niveles\nde emisiones fueron un 73.6 % y 8.1 % inferiores a las correspondientes a 1990 y al 2014 respectivamente. Este es el sector que menos emisiones genera en el INGEI.\nEste sector es donde más se evidenció la crisis económica sufrida a inicios de la década de los 90, lo que se manifiesta claramente\nen la serie analizada para el INGEI. Las emisiones de 2016 por categorías, son inferiores a las de 1990, y para algunas categorías del\n2014.\nLa categoría 2.A. Industria de los minerales (tabla 2.15 y figura\n2.15) es la de mayores emisiones del sector con 709.2 ktCO2eq. para\nun 91.4 %, siendo un 57.2 % menores que las de 1990 y en 5.7 % desde\nel 2014.\nLa categoría 2.B. Industria Química con 50.8 ktCO2eq., representó el 6.5 % de las emisiones, siendo inferiores en 94 % con respecto a 1990 y en 29.5 % desde el 2014. La pronunciada caída de\nestas emisiones en comparación con 1990 se debe a que en ese año\nlas producciones de amoníaco generaron el 67.3 % de las emisiones, y a partir de 1992 dejó de producirse en el país.\nPor último, la categoría 2.C. Industria de los metales con 16.4\nktCO2eq. representa el 2.1 % restante, estando por debajo de las\nemisiones de 1990 y 2014 en un 96.3 % y 20.4 % respectivamente.\nEl pronunciado descenso con respecto al año base se debe a que,\nen ese año, funcionaban en la principal acería del país “hornos de\nsolera” (OHF) que, según datos brindados por el GESIME, en 1992\nfueron reemplazados por hornos de arco eléctrico (EAF), lo que\nprodujo un cambio de factores de emisión para realizar las estimaciones según lo establecido en el cuadro 4.1, Volumen 3, Capítulo 4,\npágina 4.28 de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nLa notable diferencia existente entre los factores de emisión\npara ambas tecnologías (1.72 tonCO2/ton de acero, para hornos de\nsolera y 0,08 tonCO2/ton de acero, para hornos de arco eléctrico)\ninfluyó de manera significativa en la reducción de las emisiones,\nya que en 2016 se produjo un 27.4 % más de acero que en 1992\n(último año de producción con horno de solera), sin embargo, las\nemisiones fueron un 84 % menores.\n\n118\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.15 Sector IPPU.

Producción de carburo de calcio (años pares\ndesde 1990 al 2004).\nEn 2016, la producción de cemento contabilizó 672 ktCO2eq.\nregistrando valores de emisiones inferiores con respecto al año\n1990 en 55.4 % y 5.7 % en relación con el 2014. Es la subcategoría\nque más influye en la tendencia y las principales variaciones a lo\nlargo de la serie. Las causas fundamentales de la disminución de\nlas emisiones se deben al denominado Período Especial en Tiempos de Paz, provocado por la desaparición del campo socialista y el\nrecrudecimiento del bloqueo de los Estados Unidos contra Cuba.\nEn los años 2006 y 2007 aumentan las emisiones, en gran medida por un aumento en las actividades constructivas en el sector\nresidencial y en instalaciones turísticas. Sin embargo, después del\naño 2013, las emisiones generadas por esta subcategoría disminuyeron debido a falta de financiamiento para la modernización del\nequipamiento que permita alcanzar mejores niveles productivos.\nPara el caso de la producción de ácido nítrico en 2016, se emitieron 50.8 ktCO2eq., lo que representó un 80.9 % inferior a las\nemisiones de 1990 y el 29.5 % desde el 2014. La variabilidad de las\nemisiones en la subcategoría responde a la situación económica\ndel país y a la disponibilidad de materias primas para para la producción de ácido nítrico.\nLa producción de cal sumó en el último año de la serie un total\nde 37.2 ktCO2eq. emitidos, siendo inferiores a las de 1990 en un\n72.7 % y 5.6 % con respecto al 2014. Al igual que la producción de\ncemento, la causa principal de las disminuciones en la subcategoría es la crisis económica sufrida en el país a inicios de los 90. Las\ncausantes de la variabilidad de las emisiones a lo largo de la serie\nestán relacionadas con el mantenimiento de las plantas y con la\nobsolescencia y modernización de las tecnologías productivas.\nLa subcategoría que menos emite dentro del sector es la producción de hierro, acero y coque metalúrgico con 16.4 ktCO2eq. en\n2016. Este valor representó una disminución con respecto a 1990\ndel 96.3 % y del 20.4 % desde el 2014. La causante de tal reducción\nfue el cambio metodológico de los factores de emisión asociados a\nnuevas tecnologías para la producción de acero en el país.\n\n120\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.16 Sector IPPU.

Este crecimiento, y,\nen general, los niveles de cobertura boscosa alcanzados, hacen que\nen esta categoría de fuente las remociones de CO2 superen notablemente a las emisiones en los años evaluados.\nLas categorías 3.A. Ganadería y 3.C. Fuentes agregadas y fuentes de emisión no CO2 de la tierra mantienen un comportamiento similar a lo largo de la serie analizada, ocurriendo las mayores\nemisiones en el año 1990 para ambas categorías (tabla 2.19) y el año\n2005 el de menores emisiones tanto para la Ganadería con 4,362.8\nktCO2eq. como para las emisiones de Fuentes agregadas y fuentes\nde emisión no CO2 de la tierra con 4,511.9 ktCO2eq.\nCon respecto a las subcategorías (tabla 2.19 y figura 2.19) la más\nrepresentativa es la 3.A.1. Fermentación entérica con el 36.3 % de\nlas emisiones del sector sin incluir FOLU contabilizando 3,664.9\nktCO2eq., siendo un 3.3 % menores que las generadas por esta subcategoría en 1990 y un 1.5 % menores que en 2014. Esta reducción\nse debe a la disminución en la masa ganadera en el año final con\nrespecto a los dos años de referencia (1990 y 2014) representando\nel 16.3 % y en 2.9 % respectivamente.\nLe siguen en importancia las 3.C.4. Emisiones directas de N2O\nde suelos gestionados, en los que se emitieron 2,814.8 ktCO2eq.,\nrepresentando el 27.8 % de las emisiones sin incluir FOLU, lo que\nrepresentó un 50 % menos que las emisiones generadas en 1990\ny un 2.3 % superiores a las registradas en el 2014. Las reducciones\ncon respecto al año base tienen su origen en la disminución del\nuso de fertilizantes nitrogenados sintéticos ya que se aplicaron casi\n280 mil toneladas menos en 2016 en comparación con 1990, lo\nque representó un 87.5 % menos de fertilizantes usados.\nLas 3.C.6. Emisiones indirectas de N2O generadas por la gestión\nde estiércol representaron en 2016 el 11.9 % con 1,206.04 ktCO2eq.\nde las emisiones sin incluir FOLU, siendo superiores a las de 1990\ny 2014 en 1.1 % y 6.6 % respectivamente. La principal causa del aumento registrado con respecto al 2014 se debió a que en 2016 aumentaron las cabezas de ganado porcino en 274,800 animales para\nun 16.6 % superior.\n\n124\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLa subcategoría 3.A.2 Gestión del estiércol generó 1,148.9 ktCO2eq. en 2016, para el 11.4 % de las emisiones excluyendo FOLU,\nsuperando las emisiones de 1990 en 6.9 % y las de 2014 en un 5 %.\nEste aumento se encuentra originado por el crecimiento de la\nmasa porcina en el país con respecto a esos dos años.\nLa subcategoría 3.C.5. Emisiones indirectas de N2O de suelos\ngestionados representó el 6.9 % del total de las emisiones del sector\nsin incluir FOLU, expulsando 698.3 ktCO2eq. Dicho valor es un\n57.3 % inferior al registrado para 1990 y 0.48 % al alcanzado en 2014.\nEl origen de este decrecimiento se debió se debió a la disminución\nen el uso de fertilizantes nitrogenados.\nLas emisiones relacionadas con la subcategoría 3.C.7 Cultivo\ndel arroz le suceden con 412.2 ktCO2eq., lo que representa el 4.08\n% de las emisiones en 2016 excluyendo FOLU, siendo inferiores a\nlas de 1990 en 9.6 % y a las del 2014 en 18.4 %. Al tener las emisiones\ndel arroz relación directa con el área sembrada, esta constituyó la\nprincipal causa de las reducciones al compararlas con el año base\ny al 2014, ya que se dejaron de sembrar unas 14,880 hectáreas (ha)\ny 31,556 ha con respecto a esos años.\nEl país tiene una política de incrementar la producción arrocera en el país, y, con la introducción de nuevas tecnologías se ha\nlogrado incrementar los rendimientos entre 0,8 y 1,6 t/ha (Pérez y\nPenichet, 2014), lo que hace que las producciones no se vean tan\nafectadas por la reducción de las áreas de siembra.\nLas restantes subcategorías 3.B.1.a.iv.

Por su parte, las incertidumbres introducidas en la tendencia en las emisiones nacionales totales son del 90.1 %.\nEn términos generales, los sectores que más aportan a la incertidumbre (contribución a la varianza) del 2016 son AFOLU y\nDesechos seguidos de Energía e IPPU.\nEn el sector Energía, la incertidumbre combinada total fue de\n-16.0 % y +45.5 % en 2016. Las fuentes de incertidumbre que en\nmayor medida contribuyen a la varianza se encuentran en las emi-\n\n132\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsiones fugitivas de CH4 en la extracción de petróleo, seguidas\nde las emisiones de CO2 en los combustibles líquidos para las\nindustrias de la energía y las emisiones de CO2 por el consumo\nde combustibles líquidos en Industrias Manufactureras y de la\nconstrucción.\nLa incertidumbre del sector se explica por los altos valores en\nel uso de factores de emisión por defecto, específicamente para\nel caso de las emisiones de CH4 y N2O en el uso de la biomasa en\nindustrias de la energía y en las emisiones fugitivas por petróleo\ny gas natural, más que por los datos de actividad levantados en el\nBalance Energético Nacional y otras estadísticas consultadas.\nEl sector IPPU presentó una incertidumbre combinada de ± 2.1 %.\nLas fuentes de incertidumbre que más contribuyen a la varianza\nson las emisiones de CO2 en la producción de cemento, seguidas\nde las emisiones de N2O en la producción de ácido nítrico. El principal elemento que influye en las incertidumbres del sector es el\nuso de factores de emisión por defecto, sobre todo en el caso de las\nemisiones de N2O en la producción de ácido nítrico.\nEn el sector AFOLU, la incertidumbre combinada total fue de\n-34.3 % y +51.6 % para el año 2016. Las fuentes de incertidumbre\nque más contribuyen a la varianza se encuentran las absorciones\nde CO2 en las tierras forestales que permanecen como tales, así\ncomo las emisiones indirectas de N2O provenientes de la gestión\ndel estiércol y las emisiones directas de N2O en los suelos gestionados, específicamente por la componente orina y estiércol\ndepositado en pastizales, prados y praderas. En general, la incertidumbre del sector se debe a los numerosos datos paramétricos,\nen su mayoría utilizados por defecto, principalmente en la subcategoría 3.C Fuentes agregadas y fuentes de emisión no CO2 de\nla tierra.\nEn el sector Desechos, la incertidumbre combinada total fue\nde -10.2 % y 16.2 % en 2016. Las fuentes que más contribuyen a la\nvarianza son las emisiones de CH4 en los sitios de disposición de\ndesechos sólidos no categorizados, seguidas de las emisiones de\nCH4 en el tratamiento y eliminación de aguas residuales domésticas e industriales. En general, la incertidumbre del sector se debe\nal uso de parámetros y factores de emisión por defecto, tanto en\nlas emisiones de CH4 por la disposición de desechos sólidos como\nen las emisiones de CH4 del tratamiento y eliminación de aguas\nresiduales domésticas.\n\n133\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.5 Análisis de categorías clave\nLa Tabla 2.24 muestra en filas las fuentes de emisión y absorción\nidentificadas como categorías clave marcadas con X, las columnas\nindican el criterio de identificación según las Directrices del IPCC\nde 2006.

Tierras (a excepción de la Subcategoría 3.B.1.a Tierras Forestales que permanecen como tales calculadas usando las\nGuías Revisadas del IPCC de 1996).\nA partir de este notable vacío, la experiencia desarrollada por\nel IDEAM de Colombia en el Sector AFOLU en general y esta\ncategoría en específico, y en el marco del trabajo cooperativo\nde la Red Latinoamericana de Inventarios de Gases de Efecto\nInvernadero (RedINGEI), Cuba solicita el apoyo financiero y\ntécnico del PNUD/GSP para implementar una cooperación entre\nambos países durante 2019 y 2020 con el propósito de estimar las\nemisiones y absorciones de GEI en esta categoría y así mejorar de\nforma considerable el INGEI de Cuba a incluir en los próximos\ncompromisos internacionales.\n\n138\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.6.1 Plan de mejoras\nCon el objetivo de superar estas dificultades se confeccionó un Plan\nde Mejoras como herramienta de apoyo para futuros inventarios,\nen el cual se recogen los puntos críticos y oportunidades de mejoras\ntransversales y sectoriales (tabla 2.26). Este plan de mejoras permite establecer las prioridades para reducir las incertidumbres en los\nresultados y refinar los procesos de transparencia en los reportes en\nfunción de las principales deficiencias encontradas.\nEste plan de mejoras tiene relación con los esfuerzos del país\nen la implementación de las acciones de mitigación, tema de gran\nimportancia a destacar en los futuros INGEI. En el país se han alcanzado avances este sentido con la elaboración de las “Bases generales para el establecimiento de un sistema de Medición Reporte y\nVerificación (MRV) en Cuba” y se encuentra en fase de confección\nla “Hoja de ruta para la implementación de las contribuciones de\nmitigación en las CND en Cuba”.\nLas actividades de mejora planteadas requieren de la participación\nde diferentes entidades del Estado (Ministerios e instituciones asociadas), como de las universidades, centros de investigación, plantas de\nproducción, además de una importante inversión de recursos.\nLas acciones están dirigidas fundamentalmente a dar solución a\nlos vacíos y barreras institucionales encontradas en el proceso de elaboración del último INGEI. Para ello se parte de mapeos, estudios y\nmesas de coordinación con los organismos involucrados en la provisión de datos de actividad, datos paramétricos que permitan refinar\nfactores de emisión propios de país y la determinación de criterio\nde expertos. En dichos estudios y mesas quedarán identificadas las\nnecesidades de datos para las diferentes componentes, las fuentes\nprimarias de los datos, la captación de los mismos por los sistemas\nestadísticos, (territoriales, complementarios y nacional), así como la\ndisponibilidad periódica de los mismos. A partir de ello serán elaborados y formalizados los arreglos institucionales, con amparo legal,\nentre las instituciones identificadas y el ETGEI y un plan de trabajo\nen el cual se definen las principales actividades a realizar por cada\nuna de las partes para el próximo ciclo del INGEI.\nOtro aspecto a destacar es la ejecución, en la actualidad, de un proyecto que tributa a la elaboración de un “Sistema Nacional de Inventario de emisiones de GEI” (SINGEI). Dicho proyecto proveerá las bases\nesenciales para el fortalecimiento de la actividad realizada por el ETGEI y permitirá la permanencia en el tiempo de dicho proceso ya que\ndotará al INGEI de mayor exhaustividad, confiabilidad y transparencia.\n\n139\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.26 Principales vacíos y barreras encontrados en el proceso de elaboración del INGEI 1990-2016 tanto a nivel de aspectos\ntransversales como a nivel sectorial.

Acciones de mitigación\n3.1 Visión general\nComo se abordó en el epígrafe 2.2 de este documento, en el 2016,\núltimo año en el que se estimaron las emisiones de GEI en Cuba,\nen la estructura de las emisiones totales brutas en ese año se contabilizaron en 50,213.7 ktCO2eq., las absorciones de CO2 fueron de\n27,147.20 ktCO2eq., dando como resultado unas 23,066.5 ktCO2eq.\nde emisiones netas. De las emisiones totales brutas de GEI, el 70.5 %\ncorresponden al sector Energía, las que sumadas con las del sector\nAFOLU, totalizan el 90.7 % de las emisiones del país.\nTeniendo en cuenta el aporte sectorial al inventario nacional\nde GEI, los sectores priorizados para la reducción de emisiones,\nen la etapa actual, son el sector de energía y la agricultura. En estos\nsectores se concentran los esfuerzos del país en la identificación e\nimplementación de las medidas de mitigación.\nSi bien Cuba ha realizado un esfuerzo importante en la conducción de programas que han conllevado a la reducción de las\nemisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, en el país no ha existido\nun sistema que identifique claramente, formule, registre y de seguimiento a esas acciones, desde el punto de vista de la mitigación.\nPara superar esta situación se ha adoptado un enfoque general\npara el diseño e implementación de un Marco de Transparencia\nReforzado bajo el Acuerdo de París (ver punto 4.1), que ha incluido el documento Bases Generales para el establecimiento de un\nSistema MRV en Cuba, que incluye el sistema para las acciones\nde mitigación.\nEl primer esfuerzo de análisis colectivo, a diferentes niveles\nsectoriales y de gobierno, enfocado en la identificación de acciones de mitigación, se realizó durante la formulación, análisis y comunicación de las INDC del país en el año 2015.\nEse proceso tendría un importante impacto en la formulación\ny aprobación de prioridades relacionadas con la mitigación, expresadas en el PNDES 2030 y en la Tarea Vida. En esos documentos, como se analiza en los puntos 1.20 y 1.21, se va más allá de lo\ndeclarado en las CND en cuanto a sectores y objetivos estratégicos.\n\n152\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas contribuciones de mitigación declaradas por el país en su\nCND26 son:\n1.\tLa instalación, sobre la base de fuentes renovables de energía,\nde 2144 MW de potencia conectada a la red eléctrica nacional,\nque incluye la construcción de:\n• 19 bioeléctricas anexas a los centrales azucareros con\n755 MW a partir de la biomasa cañera y forestal.\n• 13 parques eólicos con 633 MW.\n• 700 MW Fotovoltaicos y,\n• 74 pequeñas centrales hidroeléctricas\n2.\tLa instalación de 200 mil m2 de calentadores solares en los\nsectores residencial e industrial.\n3.\tLa instalación de bombas solares en la agricultura.\n4.\tEl aprovechamiento de los residuos orgánicos para la producción de biogás y la obtención de bioabonos que remplazan\nfertilizantes químicos coadyuvará a la reducción de las emisiones y a la disminución de la contaminación de cuencas hidrográficas y bahías.

Este proceso dio inicio de forma más colegiada y con un seguimiento de Gobierno a partir de la incorporación de Cuba al\nAcuerdo de París. En este último período se han estado creando\nlas condiciones para iniciar a partir del 2021 la implementación\nadecuada de las acciones de mitigación contenidas en la CND.\nNo obstante, Cuba participó en los instrumentos de la convención: Protocolo de Kioto; NAMAs.\n3.2.1 Proyectos planificados bajo el Mecanismo\nde Desarrollo Limpio (MDL) en Cuba\nBajo el Protocolo de Kioto, aunque de forma tardía al final del primer período del Protocolo, se realizó un trabajo de identificación\nde proyectos bajo el Mecanismo de Desarrollo Limpio (MDL).\nAl finalizar el primer período de implementación del Protocolo\nde Kioto, en el año 2012 se disponía en Cuba de 4 proyectos MDL,\ncon diferente grado de desarrollo y en diferentes etapas de aprobación.

Necesidades en materia\nde financiamiento, tecnología\ny desarrollo de capacidades y apoyo\nrecibido\n5.1 Necesidades en materia de financiamiento,\ntecnología y desarrollo de capacidades\nEn el transcurso del desarrollo del IBA, se identificaron barreras\ny vacíos relativos al perfeccionamiento del marco institucional, el\nINGEI y las medidas de mitigación. No obstante, aún el análisis de\nnecesidades es limitado.\nPor otra parte, aún no se dispone de la capacidad ni de la información actualizada para diferenciar las necesidades de apoyo\nfinanciero, de la transferencia de tecnología y el fortalecimiento de\ncapacidades. En cuanto a la evaluación de las necesidades tecnológicas, con el apoyo de UNEP-DTU Partnership, se desarrolló un\nproyecto (TNA) en los años 2010-2012, de mucha utilidad para la\nidentificación en ese entonces de metodologías, sectores y tecnologías para el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, que se requeriría actualizar en correspondencia con los cambios y avances que\nse han ido produciendo las políticas de enfrentamiento al cambio\nclimático.\nEl sistema MRV para el apoyo no está aún diseñado en el país.\nEste subsistema no se encuentra aún incluido en el documento\nelaborado Bases Generales para el establecimiento de un sistema MRV\nen Cuba.\nLas necesidades y el apoyo recibido que se reportan en este IBA\nson el resultado de la recopilación de información aportada por\ndiferentes instituciones, por lo que no es una información acabada, ni completa.

Método de referencia para la estimación de las\nemisiones GEI para la categoría 1.A. Quema de combustibles\nPara el año 2016 se realizó la estimación de emisiones de CO2 por\nquema de combustibles usando el método de referencia según\nlas buenas prácticas recomendadas en las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006. El método de referencia es un método de arriba hacia abajo (top-down) que utiliza los datos de estadísticas de energía del\npaís para calcular las emisiones de CO2 procedentes de la quema\nde combustibles fósiles principalmente, y permite obtener una segunda estimación independiente de las emisiones de CO2 procedentes de la quema de combustible real en los diferentes sectores,\ncon una exigencia limitada en cuanto al esfuerzo adicional y a los\nrequisitos de datos. Se lo puede considerar una verificación cruzada y forma parte del proceso de control de calidad y exhaustividad\nnecesario para el sector energético (IPCC, 2006).\nEl Método de referencia se basa en la hipótesis de que se conserva el carbono de modo que, por ejemplo, el carbono del petróleo\ncrudo es igual al contenido total de carbono de todos los productos derivados, además no establece ninguna distinción entre las\ndiferentes categorías de fuente del sector de energía y solo estima\nel total de emisiones de CO2 de la categoría de fuente 1.A Quema\nde combustibles. Las emisiones son el resultado de la combustión\nen el sector de energía, en el que se usa el combustible como fuente de calor para refinar o producir energía, y de la combustión en\nel consumo final del combustible o de sus productos secundarios\npor las restantes subcategorías y componentes del sector.\nMetodología\nFue utilizada la ecuación expuesta en las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nEcuación 2.2.

In the same year, the sector’s GHG\nemissions accounted for 35,411.9 ktCO2eq., increasing by 6.4 % since 1990, mainly due to the increase in the country’s energy consumption, which includes the consumption of diesel and natural\ngas for electricity generation, as well as the consumption of liquid\nfuels for land transportation, mostly diesel and gasoline.\nIn 2016, the IPPU sector accounted for emissions of 776.3 ktCO2eq., representing only 1.6 % of the country’s total emissions\nexcluding FOLU, 73.6 % less than 1990, as it was the sector most\naffected by the economic crisis that the country endured in early\n1990s, and has not yet recovered, which is evident throughout the\nseries.\nThe AFOLU sector is the second most important as regards\nemissions in the country. It is also the only sector that acts as a\nCO2 sink. In 2016, it represented 20.1 % of GHG emissions in the\ncountry. In the same year, the balance of GHG emissions in the\nsector was negative, which shows that removals from forestry activities were higher than emissions from agricultural activities. The\ntotal resulting from the AFOLU sector accounted for an absolute\nremoval of 17,037.8 ktCO2eq., increasing by 1,431 % since 1990. This\n\n45\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsignificant increase is mainly due to the increase in the country’s\nforest areas since the beginning of the analyzed period, which has\nmaintained a marked increment throughout the series, increasing\nthe removal of emissions by 67.2 % since 1990.\nThe Wastes sector accounted for 7.8 % of total GHG emissions\n(excluding FOLU) in 2016. In the same year, the sector’s GHG\nemissions accounted for 3,916 ktCO2eq., increasing by 24.8 % since\n1990. The main cause is attributed to the sustained increase in the\ngeneration of solid wastes and their final disposal in uncategorized\nlandfills.\nMitigation actions\nPrioritized sectors for mitigation\nactions\nEnergy, AFOLU\nMain characteristics of mitigation\nactions\nA systemic process of identification and follow-up of mitigation\nactions began, in a more harmonized manner and with monitoring\nby the Government, from Cuba’s\nincorporation to the Paris Agreement and the implementation of\nthe Task Life.\nThe mitigation actions shown in the table below have been identified and are in different statuses of design and implementation.\nNone of them is still under an MRV system. The establishment of\nsuch a system for mitigation actions is one of the priorities included in the document General Bases for the establishment of an\nMRV System in Cuba. The country’s approach to establishing a\nreinforced transparency system under the Paris Agreement is expanded in point 4.1 of this Report.\nFor the implementation of the outlined mitigation strategy, it\nis necessary to overcome a set of important barriers, among which\nstand out:\n• Incorporation of the mitigation dimension into the strategies,\nplans and projects of the sectors and territories;\n• Design of new mechanisms and incentives for the implementation of mitigation actions;\n• Lack of personnel with sufficient training in the subject of cli-\n\n46\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nmate change, and specifically in mitigation, in the different\nsectors, territories and development projects where the mitigation dimension should be taken into account;\n• Information gathering systems designed for other purposes\nthat are inappropriate for mitigation purposes;\n• Lack of financing for the implementation of mitigation actions;\n• Difficulties in accessing the most appropriate technologies to\nface climate change, due to the regulations related to the US\nblockade against Cuba.\n• The implementation of the Life Task has achieved multisectoral and territorial approaches; however, there is still insufficient connection among sectors and between these and the\nterritories.\n• Insufficient systematization, in correspondence with the new\nrequirements of the reinforced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement, of the methodological, data and calculation basis for ex-ante evaluations, systematic monitoring\nand ex-post evaluations. For example: methodologies adopted for the determination of baselines, emission reduction\npotentials, national emission factors, among others.\n• Lack of national emission factors that more truly reflect the\ncharacteristics of fuels, technologies, processes and activities\nin the domestic context.\n• Lack of MRV systems required for the sectors, actions and\nprojects with the greatest impact on mitigation.\n\nMitigation\naction\nSector / Scope\nObjective /\nActions\nStatus\nBase year (base\nvalue) / target\nyear (target value)\nObtained Results\nImprovement\nActions\n1.

It is estimated that, if the necessary support were received, the country\nwould have a basically Enhanced Transparency Framework implemented in 2025.\nThe report presents the general Governance scheme of the\nMRV system, which will be legalized once the Decree for Confronting Climate Change is passed. Its draft is in the approval phase\nand recognizes the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (CITMA) as the body responsible for the general coordination of the transparency framework, to ensure compliance with\nthe international commitments assumed by the country related\nto the subject. In relation to mitigation and the transparency framework, the rest of the Agencies of the Central State Administration (OACE) are assigned, among others, specific functions related\nto the assessment and incorporation of the GHG mitigation dimension into their programs, plans and investment projects; as\nwell as the identification and contribution of the information required to control GHG emissions, as a tool to plan future actions\nand establish the necessary procedures to control and report these\nactions; and the management and use of available international financial resources, both from global and regional climate funds, as\nwell as from bilateral sources, to execute the investments, projects\nand actions that fulfill the priorities for tackling climate change.\nThe National Office of Statistics and Information, together\nwith the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment,\nis entrusted with the establishment of the bases of an information\nsystem for climate change that allows capturing the necessary information to fulfill the commitments assumed by Cuba, with the\nparticipation of the agencies of the Central State Administration,\nnational entities, Administration Councils, Higher Organization of\nBusiness Management, as well as any state or private entity, which\nare under the obligation to provide information directly related to\nclimate change.\nThe BUR presents the progress of the MRV system for the inventory, its objectives, governance, institutional arrangements, the flow\nof processes to develop the GHG Inventory, the phases/stages and\ntasks to be carried out in each phase of the inventory cycle, as well\nas its coordinators, participants and main verification indicators.\n\n52\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nSimilarly, for the MRV system of mitigation actions, the report\nshows its objectives, the mitigation measures to which the MRV\nsystem is applied, the governance system, requirements and form\nof presentation and registration of mitigation actions, as well as\nthe requirements and form of presentation of progress reports on\nmitigation actions.\nFinancing, technology and capacity building needs, and\nsupport received\nThe MRV subsystem for support is not designed yet in the country.

Circunstancias nacionales y\narreglos institucionales relativos a la\npreparación del Primer Informe Bienal\nde Actualización de Cuba\nEn respuesta a la decisión 2/CP17 de la CMNUCC, la República\nde Cuba como Estado Insular en Desarrollo, puede presentar a su\ndiscreción informes bienales de actualización. Cuba se ha comprometido a producir su Primer Informe Bienal de Actualización\n(IBA).\nEl primer Informe Bienal de Cuba se presenta en conjunción\ncon la Tercera Comunicación Nacional del país. Por consiguiente,\neste Capítulo ofrece una visión muy sintética de las circunstancias\nnacionales más relevantes a la formulación del presente Informe.\nEn ese sentido, se muestra una panorámica básica de la caracterización general del archipiélago cubano, estructura y condiciones\neconómicas actuales, la situación de sus principales recursos naturales y se amplía en la consideración de los principales sectores\neconómicos con mayor influencia en las emisiones y remociones\nde GEI y en las acciones de mitigación, al tiempo que se apuntan\nsus capacidades y limitaciones para lograr una mitigación efectiva\ndel cambio climático.\nFinalmente, se describen los arreglos institucionales bajo los\ncuales se formuló este Informe.\nEste capítulo ofrece una caracterización general del archipiélago cubano, de su estructura y condiciones económicas actuales, el\nestado del medio ambiente nacional, la situación de sus principales recursos naturales y de los principales sectores económicos con\nmayor influencia en las emisiones y remociones de GEI y en las acciones de mitigación. Además, se evidencian sus capacidades y limitaciones para lograr una mitigación efectiva del cambio climático.\n1.1 Perfil físico-geográfico\nLa República de Cuba se localiza en el llamado Mediterráneo\nAmericano, entre los 19° 49’ y 23° 16’ de latitud norte, y los 74° 08’\ny 84° 57’ de longitud oeste (ONEI, 2018). Los límites geográficos se\npueden observar en la Figura 1.1.\n\n56\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 1.1 Límites geográficos del archipiélago cubano.\nEl archipiélago cubano está formado por la isla de Cuba, la Isla de\nla Juventud y más de 1,600 islas, islotes y cayos. Cuenta con una\nsuperficie total de 109,884 km2 (Tabla 1.1), convirtiéndolo en el Estado más extenso del Caribe insular y uno de los mayores de toda\nMesoamérica. En su conjunto, la costa norte y sur, abarcan 5,746 km\nlongitud.\nTabla 1.1 Datos de extensión superficial del archipiélago cubano5\nExtensión superficial (km2)\nIsla de Cuba\n104,338.33\nIsla de la Juventud\n2,419.27\nCayos e islotes\n3,126.41\nPlataforma insular\n67,832\nDesde el punto de vista político-administrativo, Cuba se divide en\n15 provincias y 168 municipios, incluyendo al Municipio Especial\nde la Isla de la Juventud; y atendiendo a las características geoeconómicas se reconocen tres regiones: Occidente, Centro y Oriente.\nExisten 117.6 km2, con 17.5 km de costa, usurpados y ocupados ilegalmente por los Estados Unidos de América, donde mantienen,\nen contra de la voluntad del pueblo y Gobiernos de Cuba, una base\nnaval. Cuba no es responsable de las acciones nocivas al medio\nambiente y al clima que en ese lugar se generan.\n5 Anuario Cuba 2018\n\n57\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nCon una longitud de 1,250 km su parte más ancha alcanza 191 km,\nmientras que la más angosta es de solo 31 km. Esta configuración,\njunto con su orientación de este a oeste, no permite la existencia\nde ríos largos y caudalosos (el 85 % con extensión inferior a 40 km),\nlos que en su mayoría presentan cuencas pequeñas (menores de\n200 km2), cursos cortos de poco caudal, con una evacuación rápida\nde las avenidas al mar. Los recursos hídricos superficiales y subterráneos son limitados, mientras que las cuencas subterráneas están\nvinculadas a un fuerte desarrollo cársico y se destinan a satisfacer\nlas principales demandas de agua, de la producción y la población.\nLa insularidad del territorio cubano y la morfología de sus costas cubiertas en un 70 % por manglares, 20 % por costas arenosas o\nplayas y un 10 % de costas rocosas o acantilados, aumenta la vulnerabilidad ante los posibles impactos del cambio climático. La gran\nextensión del litoral cubierta por zonas bajas e inundables hace\nque la vulnerabilidad al impacto del incremento del nivel del mar\nsea muy alta. En este sentido, la protección que brindan los ecosistemas marinos y costeros sanos, sobre todo los manglares, que\nademás de cubrir el 70 % del litoral de la isla principal conforman la\nmayor parte de los 4,000 cayos e islotes que bordean los extremos\nde la plataforma insular cubana, es esencial para el sostenimiento\nde las actividades socioeconómicas del país, al propio tiempo estas formaciones de manglar y otros ecosistemas costeros, pueden\nofrecer co beneficios de mitigación, todo lo cual se encuentra hoy\nbajo estudio.\n1.2 Perfil climático\nEl clima se caracteriza por ser cálido tropical con estación lluviosa en el verano, aunque es bastante aceptado expresar que el\nclima de Cuba es tropical, estacionalmente húmedo, con influencia marítima y rasgos de semicontinentalidad. Como factores determinantes en su formación se encuentran: la radiación solar,\nla circulación atmosférica, y las características físico-geográficas\npropias del territorio.\nLos ciclones tropicales y las tormentas locales severas (tornados, granizadas, trombas marinas y vientos lineales superiores a\n90 km/h) son los fenómenos meteorológicos a los que se asocia\nel mayor peligro de desastre, y son responsables de algunos de los\nextremos climáticos observados. La temporada ciclónica va del\n1 de junio al 30 de noviembre, en la cual el bimestre septiembre\n\n58\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n- octubre resulta el de mayor afectación, con el mayor reporte de\nhuracanes intensos.\nCuba es signataria y aplica los acuerdos internacionales para la\nreducción de desastres en el marco de SENDAI.\n1.3 Población, salud, educación. Índice\nde Desarrollo Humano\nEn diciembre 2017, la población cubana había llegado a 11.2 millones de habitantes, con un equilibrio entre los sexos (unos 991\nhombres por cada 1,000 mujeres); el 77 % del total de habitantes del\npaís vivían en zonas urbanas.\nCuba se ubica entre los países más envejecidos de América Latina y el Caribe, y dentro de dos o tres décadas pasará a ocupar el\nprimer lugar. Esta situación está influida por una tasa global de\nfecundidad, francamente descendente que al cierre de 2017 era de\n1.6, a la vez que la eficiencia de los sistemas de salud incrementó\nla esperanza de vida a 78.45 años en 2018. Esto se resume en una\nreducción de la población entre 0 y 14 años, el estancamiento de la\npoblación entre 15 y 59 años y el crecimiento de la población mayor de 60 años, que en 2017 llegó a ser el 20 % de la población total.\nA partir de la proyección 2015-2050 habrá alrededor de 1.4 millones de personas mayores de 60 años más que en 2015, mientras\nque la población entre 15 y 59 años se habrá contraído en 0.7 millones de personas en ese mismo intervalo. Ello constituye un reto\npara la sociedad cubana y su desarrollo, y demanda atención priorizada, así como la elaboración de políticas y programas acorde a\nla reducción de la población en edades laborales proyectada y la\natención a las especificidades de la población envejecida.\nEl comportamiento de la migración general en Cuba se muestra en la Figura 1.2.\nEl sistema de asentamientos humanos (SAH) en Cuba está conformado por un total de 7014 asentamientos (ONEI, 2014), de los\ncuales 6,417 son rurales y 597 urbanos. Al cierre del año 2012 residían en ellos 10.6 millones de personas de forma concentrada,\nmientras que otros 569.9 miles lo hacían de manera dispersa.\n\n59\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 1.2 Tasa de migración externa (izquierda) e interna (derecha) al cierre de\n2017.\nEn Cuba se ha trabajado con indicadores proxy de salud, educación, seguridad social y otros, y más recientemente se ha obtenido\nel Índice Global de Pobreza Multidimensional (IPM), de la iniciativa de igual nombre de la Universidad de Oxford de Gran Bretaña,\nel cual se acompaña de otros indicadores y resultados de índices\ncomo el de desarrollo Humano (IDH) que de manera inclusiva\nconstatan y evidencian los resultados en la eliminación de la pobreza en Cuba y la creación de bienestar creciente con sostenibilidad para su población.6\nCuba, de forma preliminar y en fase de validación, es el segundo país en el mundo de 105 que participan en el cálculo del IPM\ncon el valor más bajo en este índice de 0.0005 y una tasa de pobreza multidimensional de 0.15 por ciento de su población para 2017.\nEn los 10 indicadores estudiados en las dimensiones de salud,\neducación y condiciones de vida, los de mortalidad infantil, acceso\na electricidad y asistencia escolar tienen los menores porcientos de\npoblación con privaciones.\nOtro indicador vinculado con la eliminación de privaciones y\nla consecuente creación de capacidades es el Índice de Desarrollo\nHumano (IDH), calculado por la oficina homónima del Programa\nde Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD).\nEl IDH es una medida resumen de los logros del promedio en\nlas principales dimensiones del desarrollo humano: una vida larga\ny saludable, estar bien informados y tener un nivel de vida digno.\nSu cálculo y evolución se considera como el criterio más impor6 Oficina Nacional de Estadística e Información (2018).

Boletín No.1 Ministerio de la Agricultura\n2016\nLas tierras agrícolas se distribuyen en cuatro categorías, identificadas del I al IV en orden descendente de agroproductividad. En este\npotencial el 76.8 % de los suelos son de categoría IV y III, estos suelos menos productivos están más presentes en la región oriental\ndel país; mientras los suelos I y II (23.2 %), de mayor agroproductividad están más presentes en las regiones occidental y central.\nLos principales factores limitantes de la agroproductividad son\nla salinización y la erosión (natural y antrópica) a los que se unen,\nla baja presencia de materia orgánica, la acidez, la compactación,\nentre otros.\n1.6 Agricultura\nEn Cuba 6 300 175 ha son tierras agrícolas, encontrándose cultivadas 2 765 212 y no cultivadas el resto que son 3 534 962 hectáreas.\nDe la superficie agrícola, están dedicadas a cultivos temporales\n1 151 131 hectáreas; a cultivos permanentes se dedican 1 454 239\nhectáreas y a la ganadería, 3 694 804 hectáreas.\nEl 79 por ciento de las tierras agrícolas es propiedad estatal, el\n14 por ciento es propiedad de Agricultores Pequeños y el 7 % es de\npropiedad cooperativa. Un total de 303 424 personas naturales poseen tierras en usufructo y 131 802 son propietarios.\n\n63\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas áreas ociosas han ido disminuyendo gradualmente a partir\nde 2008. Desde ese año hasta la fecha, se han entregado para la línea fundamental de producción de ganadería 1 200 299 hectáreas\nde tierra. De ellas, 1 71 748 hectáreas a 105 061 personas naturales,\nlo que promedia a 10.2 ha/usufructuario.\nPara producciones agrícolas, se han otorgado 624 938 hectáreas, de ellas, 433 086 a 144 962 personas naturales, lo que promedia a 3 hectáreas por usufructuario. Para la actividad forestal, se\nhan otorgado 14 826 hectáreas, de las cuales 9 793 a 1 253 personas\nnaturales, con un promedio de 7.8 hectáreas.\nEl área cultivada es de 2 765 213 ha. Se consideran áreas donde\nse practica agricultura sostenible por estar sometidas a procesos de\nmanejo sostenible de suelos un total de 1 051 000 ha, lo que equivale a 60 % del área. Para 2030 se proyecta alcanzar el 100 % de las\náreas de cultivo y con ello además de otras medidas de tipo agrotécnicas lograr rendimientos superiores. Para lograr esto, se aplica\nuna estrategia para la conservación y mejoramiento de suelos que\nincluye un diagnóstico y las acciones estratégicas.\nEntre las acciones o líneas estratégicas para alcanzar las metas\npropuestas por el país al 2030 se encuentran:\n• Incrementar hasta el 2030 en un millón de hectáreas la superficie agrícola beneficiadas por el Programa Nacional de\nMejoramiento y Conservación de Suelos con el propósito de\ngarantizar el manejo sostenible de los suelos.\n• Aumentar hasta el 2030 en un 10 % el rendimiento productivo\nen áreas beneficiadas por el Programa Nacional de Conservación y Mejoramiento de Suelos, para contribuir a la seguridad\nalimentaria.\n• Extender hasta el 2030 en 150 000 hectáreas las áreas bajo categorías de Manejo Sostenible de Tierras asegurando la productividad de los suelos con enfoque integrado y sostenible\nde los recursos naturales, para contribuir a alcanzar la soberanía alimentaria del país.\n\nLa superficie bajo riego actualmente es de 459 008 hectáreas, representando 7.4 % con relación a la superficie agrícola\n(6 240 263 hectáreas) y 17 % de la superficie cultivada, indicador por\nel cual se mide la superficie con riego en otros países. Se proyecta\npara el período 2019-2030 llegar al 30 %, que representa 1 413 000\nha más, con lo cual, los rendimientos agrícolas y ganaderos se incrementarían.\n\n64\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.7 Bosques y prácticas de gestión forestal\nLos bosques cubanos se clasifican en siete categorías, sobre la base\nde un conjunto de elementos de orden físico, biológico, ecológico\ny social 9 (Tabla 1.3). La Ley Forestal también establece que los bosques son administrados con arreglo a sus funciones y ubicación\ngeográfica.\nTabla 1.3 Clasificación de los bosques en Cuba (Ley Forestal; Ley\n85 de 1998)\nClasificación\nCategorías\n1.

Tal crecimiento ha significado una incorporación promedio a la superficie boscosa del país de 30 mil hectáreas\ncada año.\n9 La Ley Forestal cubana (Ley 85) (ANPP, 1998) vigente desde octubre de 1998, estableció en\nsu Artículo 15 la clasificación de los bosques cubanos\n\n65\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 1.4 Área cubierta de bosques (Mha) y porcentaje de cobertura boscosa en\nCuba. Fuente: Dirección Forestal, Flora y Fauna Silvestre MINAG, 2016.\n1.8 Recursos hidráulicos\nLos recursos hídricos nacionales están afectados en cantidad y calidad, debido a la sobreexplotación de acuíferos, el vertimiento de\nsustancias contaminantes a los cuerpos de agua, los cambios en el\nuso del suelo tales como la deforestación, las prácticas agrícolas inadecuadas, el incremento de urbanizaciones en zonas de producción hídrica, la intrusión salina, entre otros. El potencial de estos\nrecursos se muestra en la Figura 1.5.\nFigura 1.5 Esquema de la disponibilidad de agua en Cuba\n\n66\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nCuba presenta un trabajo sostenido en alza constante de la cobertura de agua a la población, alcanzándose en el 2017 un 95,6 %.\nEl país exhibe una ardua gestión en la cobertura de saneamiento\nbásico, que alcanza el 97 % por ciento de la población total residente.\nLa infraestructura actual dispone de 242 embalses, los que almacenan cerca de 9 mil millones de metros cúbicos. A ellos se unen 61\nderivadoras, 805 micropresas, 788.4 km de canales magistrales, 16\ngrandes estaciones de bombeo, 1,300.4 km de diques y 1,009.2 km\nde canales para la protección contra inundaciones.\nEn la última década, el volumen de agua entregado anualmente\npara todos los usos, ha oscilado entre 6 mil y 8 mil millones de m3.\nEn la Figura 1.6 se muestra un esquema de este uso por sectores.\nFigura 1.6 Esquema del uso del agua en Cuba\nEn el año 2017, fueron emitidas dos disposiciones de gran relevancia; se trata de la Ley 124 “De las Aguas Terrestres” de 14 de julio\nde 2017 y su Reglamento aprobado por el Decreto 337. En ellas se\nregula la gestión integrada y sostenible de las aguas terrestres que\nse encuentran dentro de la corteza terrestre o encima de ella, independientemente de su composición física, química o bacteriológica, en el espacio que conforma la parte emergida del territorio\nnacional limitado por la línea de costa. En dichas normativas, por\n\n67\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nprimera vez en el marco legal nacional, se trata de manera expresa\nsobre la protección de las aguas, así como, se declara como uno\nde los objetivos establecer medidas para reducir su vulnerabilidad\nante los efectos actuales o esperados de los cambios del clima.\n1.9 Energía\nEl sector energía es transversal a todo el desarrollo económico y\nsocial del país. En términos de emisiones a este sector corresponde\nel 71.2 % de las emisiones totales del país, por lo que es clave para\nla mitigación.\nA continuación, se muestran los principales indicadores del\nsector entre el 2015 y el 2018\n1.9.1 Producción de energía primaria\nLa producción de energía primaria se muestra en la figura 1.7, donde se aprecia que la producción de gas natural (en este caso es gas\nacompañante del petróleo) disminuye ligeramente en el período.\nEl petróleo y los productos de la caña decrecen en el 2016 y tienen\nun pequeño incremento en el 2017 y 2018. La producción nacional de energía primaria en el 2018 es 2.5 % menor que en el 2015\n(ONEI, 2017; ONEI, 2018).\nFigura 1.7 Producción de energía primaria por portadores energéticos.\n\n68\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLa matriz de producción de energía primaria en el 2018 fue: 50.3 %\nPetróleo, 30.2 % Productos de caña, 16.6 % Gas natural, 2.6 % Leña\ny 0.2 % Hidroenergía (Excluida de la figura porque no se aprecia).\nLa participación del biogás, eólica y solar es insignificante (ONEI,\n2017; ONEI, 2018; ONEI, 2019).\n1.9.2 Producción de energía secundaria\nLa producción nacional de energía secundaria en el 2015 fue 1.3 veces superior a la de energía primaria, en el 2016 fue 5.3 % inferior,\nen el 2017 fue 17.7 % inferior y en el 2018 fue 18.8 % inferior respecto\nal 2015. Entre el 2015 y el 2018 la producción de energía secundaria\ndecreció en 40.1 % por la reducción de la refinación ya que la producción de electricidad solo tuvo un incremento del 2.7 % en ese\nperíodo (Figura 1.8) (ONEI, 2017; ONEI, 2018; ONEI, 2019).\nLa matriz de producción de energía secundaria en el 2018 fue:\n53.8 % Derivados del petróleo, 42.8 % electricidad, 2 % Gas manufacturado, 1.2 % Carbón vegetal y 0.3 % Alcohol desnaturalizado\n(ONEI, 2019).\nFigura 1.8 Producción de energía secundaria por portadores energéticos\n1.9.3 Importaciones\nCuba cuenta con limitadas producciones de petróleo y gas acompañante del petróleo y se ve necesitada de importar crudo princi-\n\n69\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\npalmente para la refinación, ya que el crudo nacional se utiliza en\nla generación de electricidad y derivados ya que las capacidades\nde refinación no abastecen la demanda nacional de derivados.

La expansión futura de la generación del SEN se sustentará esencialmente en el incremento de las\nfuentes renovables de energía, en el fortalecimiento de la generación térmica convencional y la instalación de nuevas capacidades\nen Ciclos Combinados a gas.\nUna transformación esencial del marco legal nacional, ocurre\ncon la promulgación del Decreto-Ley no. 345, de 23 de marzo de\n2017, 15 “Del desarrollo de las fuentes renovables y el uso eficiente\nde la energía”, Este Decreto Ley tiene como objeto (Artículo 1), establecer las regulaciones para el desarrollo de las fuentes renovables y el uso eficiente de la energía, a fin de contribuir con:\na.\tLa elevación de la participación de las fuentes renovables de\nenergía en la generación de electricidad;\nb.\tla sustitución progresiva de los combustibles fósiles;\nc.\tla diversificación de la estructura de los combustibles fósiles\nempleados en la generación de energía eléctrica;\nd.\tla elevación de la eficiencia y el ahorro energéticos;\ne.\tla estimulación de la inversión, la investigación y la elevación\nde la eficiencia energética, así como la producción y utilización de energía a partir de fuentes renovables, mediante el\nestablecimiento de incentivos y demás instrumentos que estimulen su desarrollo;\nf.\tel desarrollo de la producción de equipos, medios y piezas de\nrepuesto por la industria nacional, para el aprovechamiento\nde las fuentes renovables y la eficiencia energética; y\ng.\tel establecimiento en el sector estatal de un sistema de trabajo que incluya la planificación de las tareas que posibilite el\ncumplimiento de los objetivos trazados.\n1.10 Transporte\nEn Cuba las diferentes categorías pertenecientes al subsector transporte, se caracterizan por proceder de diferentes zonas geográficas y tener un variado conjunto de técnicas de fabricación, lo que\n15 Aparecido en la Gaceta Oficial No.95, Edición Ordinaria, la Habana, 28 de noviembre de\n2019 Año cxvii.\n\n75\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nunido al envejecimiento técnico ocasionado por el prolongado\nperíodo de explotación, y al uso de tecnologías de baja eficiencia\nenergética, promueven altos niveles de emisiones de gases producto a la combustión. Esto se ve agravado por una no adecuada\ncalidad de los combustibles que se producen en el país, que específicamente para los medios de transporte automotor de carretera\nconstituye una limitante en la adquisición de tecnologías de última generación.\nEn el período se han realizado acciones de desarrollo en el\nsector transporte. Entre las principales acciones se encuentran la\nintroducción, en el modo automotor, de vehículos eléctricos e híbridos (ómnibus para el transporte público y vehículos eléctricos\nen algunas empresas de servicios) y la entrada masiva de motos\neléctricas privadas. En cuanto al sector ferroviario se tiene la materialización, en su primera etapa, del proceso inversionista relacionado con la adquisición de 240 coches de pasajeros nuevos\nprocedente de la República Popular China, a razón de 80 coches\nanuales entre el 2019 y 2021 y 70 locomotoras rusas objetivo contemplado en el Programa de Recuperación y Desarrollo del Ferrocarril (2016-2028).\nA continuación, se ofrece una panorámica sobre los diferentes\nmodos de transporte en el país.\n1.10.1 Transporte automotor\nEl transporte automotor es el principal responsable de las emisiones\ndel subsector transporte. Más del 50 % de la flota vehicular presenta\nuna situación técnica deficiente,16 debido al régimen de explotación\nexcesivo al que es sometido como consecuencia de la poca disponibilidad de vehículos, el mal estado de las vías, la carencia de piezas\nde repuestos y la no periodicidad de los mantenimientos.\nEn el año 2017, la edad promedio de todo el parque vehicular\nera de 35.2 años (Figura 1.11), siendo los más envejecidos los autos,\nlos jeeps y las camionetas. La mayor incidencia en este envejecimiento lo tienen los vehículos particulares. Los paneles, ómnibus\ny microbuses están alrededor de los 20 años de explotación. En la\nactualidad el 89 % de los vehículos automotores, son equipos tractivos17 y se encuentran en buen estado de funcionamiento.\n16 Biart H. Rafael, et al.

La distribución por clases, aptos para funcionar, se\nmuestra en la tabla 1.7, donde se aprecia que los mayores porcientos\nen cantidad, se acumulan en las motos y los autos, para aproximadamente el 81.8 % del total de los vehículos. No obstante, ellos son\nvehículos de uso prácticamente individual, mientras que los de uso\ncolectivo: camiones, ómnibus y cuñas solo agrupan al 10.4 %.\nTabla 1.7 Distribución por clases de los vehículos tractivos en explotación\nAutos\nCamión\nCamionetas\nMotos\nÓmnibus\nPaneles\nCuñas\nJeep\nMicrobús\n29.0%\n7.2%\n2.4%\n52.8%\n2.3%\n1.8%\n0.9%\n3.0%\n0.7%\nFuente: Datos del Registro de Vehículos, la Aduana y elaboración propia.\nEn general, en el país el 99.98 % de los vehículos, consumen gasolina y diésel, solo el 0.2 % utiliza otro tipo de carburante (gas, electricidad y otros). La cantidad de cada uno de estos combustibles, en\ncada una de las clases no es homogénea, además de diferenciarse\nla norma de consumo de cada uno de ellos.

Fuente:\nDatos del Registro de Vehículos y elaboración propia.\n1.10.2 Transporte ferroviario\nLa transportación de pasajeros por este modo de transporte se ha\ncaracterizado por el decrecimiento continuo del parque de equipos,\nel que se encuentra en mal estado técnico por ser de segunda mano y\ntener largos años de servicio, con reparaciones diferidas, bajo Coeficiente de Disponibilidad y un elevado Índice de fallos. Esto ocasiona\natrasos en la corrida de los trenes y alteración en la circulación ferroviaria, problemática que se extiende también a los coches motores.\nEsta situación ha originado la necesidad de sustituir algunos\nservicios por ómnibus y disminuir la frecuencia de salida de los\ntrenes nacionales a cuatro días. La calidad del servicio es deficiente, así como su confort, no existiendo una logística que garantice el\nsuministro de piezas de repuesto de manera estable. La velocidad\nde circulación de los coches ha tenido que ser reducida por su mal\nestado técnico\nEn el caso de la carga las transportaciones se han visto afectadas\npor la baja disponibilidad de locomotoras de alto porte, así como alto\níndice de fallos, alta rotación de los medios de transporte, bajo coeficiente de disponibilidad técnica de los vagones e incumplimientos de\nlos plazos de descarga de casillas en los Centros de Carga y Descarga.\n\n78\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nA partir del 2016 se ha visto una revitalización en este modo de\ntransporte, fundamentalmente con la adquisición de nuevos equipos tractivos y arrastres lo que favoreció el incremento del nivel\nde actividad del sector en la transportación de pasajeros y carga\nrespectivamente. El incremento de aportación del ferrocarril en el\nmovimiento de las cargas, conllevó una sensible disminución de la\nmisma para el automotor.\n1.10.3 Transporte marítimo\nEste modo de transporte en el país está subdivido en flota auxiliar de puerto y la de cabotaje, presentando cada una las siguientes\nproblemáticas.\nFlota auxiliar de puerto\nSe cuenta con 34 remolcadores; 20 lanchas de prácticos; siete (7)\nnaves auxiliares; 12 naves de consignatarios; una (1) patana taller;\ncinco (5) grúas flotantes; una (1) patana de carga PC-400; una (1)\ndragalina; cuatro (4) lanchas limpia-bahías y una (1) patana para\nrecogida de basura. Las naves auxiliares del puerto han sido operadas por alrededor de 23 años como promedio, estando el 21 % en\nmal estado técnico o no operacional.\nEn cuanto a los remolcadores se han operado por 17 años como\npromedio. A pesar de su relativo poco tiempo de uso, el deterioro\nde los mismos es más severo que en las otras naves.\nCon relación a la mitad de la flota de combustible esta se encuentra en mal estado, no siendo así el caso de las lanchas de prácticos que están en buenas condiciones.\nFlota de cabotaje\nSe cuenta con seis (6) buques RO-RO, 12 patanas, 10 de ellas destinada a la transportación de combustible y 11 remolcadores. La\nmayoría de estos medios presentan un gran deterioro causado por\nalrededor de 35 años de explotación sin una reparación adecuada.\nEn el caso de los remolcadores aunque presentan un estado\naceptable, llevan explotándose más de 40 años lo que inciden en\nsu capacidad técnica. Estos medios no son suficientes lo que motiva\nque a veces es utilizado en varios puertos, provocando mayores gastos de combustible y demoras para los barcos entrando al puerto.\n\n79\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.10.4 Transporte aéreo\nActualmente el número de vuelos totales programados publicados\npor día (llegadas y salidas) es de alrededor de 40, las cuales están\nprincipalmente concentrados durante las horas tempranas de la\nmañana y al final de la tarde, con escasos vuelos durante el día. La\ndemanda potencial para los vuelos nacionales es alta, especialmente\nentre turistas extranjeros, sin embargo como el número de naves es\nlimitado, no es posible incrementar el tráfico aéreo en las rutas\nLa flota de operación de Cubana está limitada a seis (6) pequeñas aeronaves operadas para vuelos nacionales/regionales y tres\n(3) Ilyshin IL 96 que son aeronaves de gran ancho de fuselaje para\nvuelos de largas distancias. Para rehabilitar los vuelos y remplazar\nlos aviones inmovilizados, Cubana está alquilando aeronaves (con\ny sin tripulación) de varios operadores extranjeros.\n1.10.5 Estrategias y planes del sector relacionadas\ncon la mitigación\nEntre las nuevas estrategias del sector está la promoción del uso de\nvehículos eléctricos, para lo que se ha elaborado una Propuesta de\npolítica para el uso y desarrollo perspectivo de los vehículos eléctricos en el transporte automotor 2020– 2030.\nEn estos momentos se explotan 40 ómnibus híbridos (eléctrico-Diésel) en la transportación de pasajeros en la capital, del tipo\nrígido de la firma Yutong. Funcionan con baterías eléctricas dos\ntaxis de la Empresa Taxi Cuba, una flota de 24 paneles de la Empresa Aguas de La Habana y un ómnibus operado por la Empresa\nde Ómnibus Urbano de la capital.\nSe continúa con el proceso de remotorización de los vehículos,\ncomo una forma de ahorro energético y por ende como una medida de mitigación.\nSe trabaja en el incremento de las transportaciones de pasajeros\npor ferrocarril, a partir de la adquisición de nuevos coches ferroviarios, así como el traspaso de carga del transporte automotor a\nferroviario para medianas y largas distancias.\nA escala de proyecto se trabaja en la implementación de un sistema de transporte bajo en carbono para La Habana, que permitirá evaluar y medir los resultados del mismo a partir del uso de la\nenergía eléctrica.\n\n80\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.11 Construcción\nLas principales emisiones de CO2 y partículas sólidas en este sector se derivan de la producción de materiales para la construcción (Tabla1.8). Además, en el sector están promoviendo una serie\nde acciones relacionadas con el cambio climático debido a lo cual\ncomo política está el incremento en cantidad de proyectos de investigación y como línea de deseo la introducción de tecnologías\nahorradoras de portadores energéticos (mediante paneles solares)\ny de recursos hídricos dentro de los procesos de producción industrial y de otra índole en el sector.\nTabla 1.8 Principales materiales de la construcción producidos en\nel país\nProducciones (Mt)\n2014\n2016\nCal\n51.5\n48.6\nCemento\n1,579.9\n1,492.6\n1.12 Desarrollo local\nEl desarrollo local en Cuba se asume como un proceso esencialmente endógeno, participativo, innovador y de articulación de\nintereses entre actores, territorios y escalas (municipal, provincial\ny sectorial/nacional). Se sustenta en el liderazgo de los gobiernos\nmunicipales y provinciales para la gestión de sus estrategias de\ndesarrollo dirigidas, desde la gestión del conocimiento y la innovación, al fomento de proyectos que generen transformaciones\neconómico-productivas, socioculturales, socioculturales, ambientales e institucionales, con el objetivo de elevar la calidad de vida\nde la población.\nLa visión del desarrollo territorial al 2030 se caracteriza por\nla objetividad de estrategias de desarrollo municipal y planes de\nordenamiento territorial y urbano que constituyen la base del proceso de planificación e inversión, que contribuyen a reducir las\ndesproporciones territoriales.\nEn el contexto nacional actual, se avanza hacia un proceso de\ndescentralización a partir del otorgamiento constitucional de una\nmayor autonomía municipal, con lo cual el desarrollo local adquiere mayor relevancia.\n\n81\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos municipios que se incorporan a esta perspectiva, orientan\nsu proceso de desarrollo sobre la base de su Estrategia de Desarrollo Municipal (EDM), conformada por programas y proyectos que\nresponden a políticas locales. Este instrumento rector del sistema\nde planificación a nivel municipal, se compatibiliza con el Plan\nGeneral de Ordenamiento Territorial y Urbano, lo cual propicia el\nestablecimiento de relaciones horizontales a través de la articulación multiactoral y multisectorial, permitiendo un uso más efectivo de los recursos disponibles.\nLos efectos del cambio climático tienen una expresión más concreta a escala local, pero también desde ella pueden acometerse\ngran parte de las acciones necesarias para su enfrentamiento, tanto en términos de mitigación como de adaptación, constituyendo\nuna prioridad orientada a garantizar la sostenibilidad del desarrollo. En este sentido, se promueve la inserción de este enfoque en\nlas políticas, programas y proyectos asociados a las EDM, así como\nla gestión de diversas fuentes de financiamiento para reducir las\nvulnerabilidades de cada territorio conforme a sus particularidades sociales, económicas y ambientales.\n1.13 Prioridades y objetivos de desarrollo\nLa sociedad cubana se encuentra en proceso de actualización de\nsu modelo económico y social de desarrollo socialista. En abril de\n2016, el 7mo. Congreso del Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) analizó y aprobó la Conceptualización del Modelo Económico y Social\nCubano de Desarrollo Socialista, las Bases del Plan Nacional de\nDesarrollo Económico y Social hasta el 2030: Visión de la Nación,\nEjes y Sectores Estratégicos y los Lineamientos de la Política Económica y Social del Partido y la Revolución para el período 20162021. Estos documentos fueron sometidos a un amplio proceso de\nconsulta popular y posteriormente se aprobaron por la Asamblea\nNacional del Poder Popular el 1 de junio de 2017.\nEn las Bases del PNDES hasta el 2030, se establecen seis ejes\nestratégicos, diseñados bajo un enfoque sistémico, que articulan\nla propuesta de desarrollo económico y social hasta el 2030 y\ncontribuyen, desde su área de influencia, a la consecución de ese\npropósito a largo plazo.\n\n82\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos seis ejes estratégicos son:\n1.\tGobierno socialista, eficaz, eficiente y de integración social;\n2.\tTransformación productiva e inserción internacional;\n3.\tInfraestructura;\n4.\tPotencial humano, ciencia, tecnología e innovación;\n5.\tRecursos naturales y medio ambiente\n6.\tDesarrollo humano, equidad y justicia social.\nEn torno a estos ejes estratégicos se establecen veintidós objetivos\ngenerales y ciento once objetivos específicos.\nEl planteamiento programático del país para la determinación\nde su futuro es que “La Visión de la Nación, entendida como el\nestado o situación que se desea alcanzar, se define como soberana,\nindependiente, socialista, democrática, próspera y sostenible. Entre los retos futuros que asume están los asociados a los constantes\ncambios en términos científicos, tecnológicos y climáticos”.\nCon estas premisas el modelo económico que se promueve\nconsidera vital el enfrentamiento al cambio climático y se plantea: Implementar de manera eficaz y eficiente los programas y acciones\npara el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, con énfasis en la adaptación, la reducción de la vulnerabilidad, y la introducción de estrategias\nsistémicas e intersectoriales, así como, Elevar la eficiencia energética y\nel desarrollo de fuentes renovables de energía, lo que contribuye, entre\notros beneficios, a reducir la generación de gases de efecto invernadero, a\nmitigar el cambio climático y a promover un desarrollo económico menos\nintenso en carbono.\nPara cumplir sus metas de desarrollo y de enfrentamiento al\ncambio climático, Cuba, como muchos países en vías de desarrollo, se enfrenta a gigantescos desafíos económicos, a lo cual se\nsuma la aplicación y el recrudecimiento de la política de bloqueo\neconómico, comercial y financiero impuesto por el gobierno de\nEstados Unidos por casi 60 años, que le impide acceder a financiamientos de las principales instituciones financieras internacionales\ny además, mantiene una férrea persecución financiera a aquellos\nrecursos a los que el país ha podido acceder, o a sus transacciones\nfinancieras resultado de su comercio exterior. El bloqueo impide al país acceder a tecnologías, equipamientos y conocimientos\ncientíficos y técnicos requeridos, para su desarrollo sostenible.\nMás recientemente el bloqueo ha continuado recrudeciéndose\ncon la aplicación del Título III de la Ley Helms-Burton, que ataca\nla libertad de comercio y refuerza el carácter extraterritorial de las\n\n83\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsanciones contra Cuba, además de dañar las relaciones económicas y comerciales del país con la Comunidad Internacional.\nLa política de bloqueo constituye el principal obstáculo al\ndesarrollo económico de Cuba y, por ende, a la implementación\ndel PNDES 2030, la Agenda 2030 y sus ODS, la Tarea Vida y las\nNDC.\n1.14 Prioridades relacionadas con la mitigación\ndel cambio climático\nLa contribución de Cuba a las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero es mínima y no rebasa el 0.08 %. No obstante, Cuba\nha realizado esfuerzos importantes en la reducción de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. Fue uno de los primeros países\nen el mundo en iniciar el reemplazo de las bombillas incandescentes (2005), y ha mantenido desde 1959 un incremento sostenido de\nsu cubierta boscosa.\nLa mitigación es apreciada en las políticas nacionales como una\ndimensión esencial del desarrollo que contribuye a la modernización y el desarrollo tecnológico sobre bases de sostenibilidad, al\nfortalecimiento de sus capacidades, la mejora de la efectividad y\neficiencia de los procesos al disminuir el consumo de portadores\nenergéticos de origen fósil, a un uso de tecnologías más eficientes,\na una mejor gestión de los residuos, entre otros elementos importantes y transversales a toda la actividad económica del país.\nCuba produce cerca del 96 % de su energía eléctrica a partir del\nempleo de combustibles fósiles, con una alta dependencia de la\nimportación, elevados costos de generación y una infraestructura\ntecnológica de altas emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero.\nEn respuesta a estas coyunturas, el Consejo de Ministros aprobó\nen 2014 la “Política para el Desarrollo Perspectivo de las Fuentes\nRenovables y el Uso Eficiente de la Energía”, dirigida a aprovechar\nal máximo los recursos renovables disponibles en el país.\nEl Plan Nacional de Desarrollo Económico y Social al 2030\n(PNDES 2030), introduce por primera vez en las políticas públicas\ndel país, el concepto de un desarrollo menos intenso en emisiones\nde gases de efecto invernadero.\nEl 25 de abril de 2017 el Consejo de Ministros aprobó el Plan de\nEstado para el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, conocido también como Tarea Vida. Este Plan tiene un alcance y jerarquía superiores a todos los documentos elaborados anteriormente sobre\n\n84\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\neste tema, además de actualizarlos e incluir la dimensión territorial. El Plan requiere concebir y ejecutar un programa de inversiones progresivas, a corto (2020), mediano (2030), largo (2050) y\nmuy largo plazos (2100).\nEn la “Tarea Vida” aparece una referencia particular a la mitigación y a su implementación en 12 sectores claves del desarrollo:\nseguridad alimentaria, energía renovable, eficiencia energética, ordenamiento territorial y urbano, pesca, agropecuaria, salud, turismo,\nconstrucción, transporte, industria y manejo integral de los bosques.\nEs importante considerar que, desde el punto de vista legal,\nCuba asume compromisos de mitigación, bajo la CMNUCC y el\nAcuerdo de París.\nCuba es parte de la CMNUCC, desde el cinco de marzo de 1994\ny es parte del Protocolo de Kioto desde julio de 2002. Firmó el\nAcuerdo de París el 22 de abril de 2016 y lo ratificó en enero de\n2017. Al ser parte de estos instrumentos internacionales, Cuba adquiere las responsabilidades que derivan de lo dispuesto en ellos.\nCuba presentó su propuesta de Contribución Nacionalmente\nDeterminada (INDC por sus siglas en inglés) el 23 de noviembre\ndel 2015, la cual se convirtió automáticamente en su CND al ratificar el Acuerdo de París. En ella se incluyen contribuciones en\nadaptación, reconocida como prioridad y contribuciones en mitigación. Las CND comunicadas por Cuba están en concordancia\ncon el Plan de Estado para el Enfrentamiento al Cambio Climático\n(Tarea Vida) y con el Programa de Desarrollo Económico y Social\ndel país al 2030 (PNDES 2030).\nSin embargo, mientras que la actual Contribución Nacionalmente Determinada (CND) de Cuba (2015) se concentra en el\nsector de la energía, con un peso importante en las energías renovables, el Plan de Estado amplía las exigencias de la mitigación\na otras políticas sectoriales, incluyendo el sector agropecuario,\nel turismo, la construcción, el transporte, la industria y el manejo de los bosques (Tarea 8), lo cual es potenciado por el llamado a “la promoción de un desarrollo menos intenso en carbono”,\nen las Bases del Plan de Desarrollo Económico y Social al 2030,\nesta extensión de las acciones de mitigación, incluye iniciativas\nvinculadas al uso de la bioenergía, la promoción de la movilidad\nsostenible, el papel de los bosques en la remoción de carbono y la\npromoción de estrategias de desarrollo bajo en carbono.\n\n85\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.15 Arreglos institucionales relativos\na la preparación del Primer Informe Bienal\nde Actualización de Cuba\nLa República de Cuba presenta su Primer Informe Bienal de Actualización (IBA) a la Convención Marco de Naciones Unidas sobre\nCambio Climático (CMNUCC). El IBA se ha elaborado con el apoyo financiero del Fondo para el Medio Ambiente Mundial (FMAM)\ny está siendo implementado por el Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología y Medio Ambiente, con el apoyo del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD).\nEl Primer IBA se elaboró bajo las Directrices de la CMNUCC\npara los IBA de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención adoptadas en la 17 Conferencia de las Partes (Anexo III de la\nDecisión 2/CP.17).\nPor la parte cubana, el Centro de Gestión de la Información y\nDesarrollo de la Energía (CUBAENERGÍA), bajo la coordinación\ngeneral del Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología y Medio Ambiente,\ncoordinó, a nivel técnico-ejecutivo, las actividades fundamentales\ncon los organismos y entidades nacionales para la conformación\ndel IBA. La elaboración del IBA se desarrolló en el marco y con el\napoyo del proyecto Tercera Comunicación y Primer Informe Bienal de\nActualización, financiado por el FMAM, con el acompañamiento\ndel PNUD como entidad implementadora y el INSMET como entidad ejecutora cubana.\nEl informe contiene una recopilación de los principales elementos de las circunstancias nacionales con mayor influencia en\nlas emisiones y remociones de GEI y en las acciones de mitigación,\nel inventario nacional de gases de efecto invernadero (INGEI) con\nbase en los datos del año 2016, la información sobre las acciones\nde mitigación, el estado de desarrollo e implementación del sistema MRV y el apoyo recibido y el requerido.\nPara la ejecución de todo el trabajo fue necesario de una coordinación muy estrecha de muchas instituciones nacionales. Un esquema general de los arreglos institucionales para la elaboración\ndel IBA se muestra en la figura 1.13.\nCada uno de los OACEs y ENs designaron funcionarios y especialistas para la conformación de los equipos técnicos que trabajaron cada uno de los capítulos del IBA.\n\n86\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos equipos técnicos estuvieron integrados por funcionarios\ny especialistas de los ministerios y entidades nacionales como el\nMINEM, MINAG, MITRANS, MINDUS, ONEI, IPF, INRH; por entidades y empresas como la UNE, ONURE, CUBAENERGÍA, UH,\nINAF, GEGAN, EIIP, INSMET, CIMAB.\nLa información requerida fue suministrada por la ONEI, por\nlos sistemas estadísticos complementarios de los organismos y por\nentidades y empresas. La coordinación para la elaboración del capítulo 2, referido al INGEI se realizó por el Equipo Técnico del\nINGEI del INSMET. La coordinación para la elaboración del resto\nde los capítulos se llevó a cabo por el Grupo de Cambio Climático\nde CUBAENERGÍA. La redacción final del informe se llevó a cabo\npor CUBAENERGÍA.\nFigura 1.13 Esquema general de los arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del IBA. Fuente: Equipo técnico mitigación CUBAENERGÍA.\nEl trabajo se inició en el año 2017 con un taller, donde participaron\nespecialistas y funcionarios de los organismos, entidades nacionales, centros académicos, universidades, instituciones proveedoras\nde datos e información, todos vinculados a las emisiones y remociones de gases de efecto invernadero y a las acciones de mitigación. Con ese taller quedaron esclarecidos los principales objetivos\ndel trabajo para la elaboración del IBA, las principales actividades\n\n87\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\na abordar y los principales resultados a obtener. En lo fundamental\nquedaron definidos los principales roles y responsabilidades de las\ninstituciones para la conformación del IBA.\nA partir de ese momento se efectuaron un total de 6 talleres,\ncon la participación de los principales especialistas y funcionarios\nvinculados con la elaboración del IBA, donde se iban exponiendo\nlos resultados obtenidos y la marcha de las actividades principales.\nEn los períodos intermedios de los talleres se efectuaron más de\n20 reuniones técnicas con las instituciones involucradas para tratar aspectos específicos del trabajo. En tres ocasiones la marcha del\ntrabajo de elaboración del IBA fue expuesto en el Grupo Nacional\nde Cambio Climático, que dirige la ministra del CITMA y donde\nparticipan representantes de los ministros del resto de los ministerios. Estas reuniones fueron muy importantes para socializar el\ntrabajo, intercambiar experiencias y tomar decisiones importantes\npara dar impulso al trabajo que se desarrollaba.\nUna vez concluida la etapa técnica, el IBA pasó a un nivel de\nconsulta amplio, bajo la coordinación de la ministra del CITMA,\ncon la participación de los representantes de los Jefes de todos los\nOACE y EN implicados. Finalmente, el IBA fue aprobado por el\nGobierno.\n\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nDE LA REPÚBLICA DE CUBA\n\n89\n2. Inventario Nacional de Gases de\nEfecto Invernadero\n2.1 Introducción\nDando cumplimiento al Artículo 4, párrafo 1a y al Artículo 12, párrafo 1a de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre\nCambio Climático (en lo adelante CMNUCC), Cuba en el marco de\ndos comunicaciones nacionales, ha presentado el reporte de emisiones y absorciones de gases de efecto invernadero (en lo adelante\nGEI) para los años pares de la serie 1990-2002 con las actualizaciones correspondientes (Tabla 2.1).\nTabla 2.1 Inventarios Nacionales de GEI de Cuba comunicados a la\nCMNUCC\nReporte\nAño de entrega\nAños incluidos en el INGEI\nPrimera Comunicación Nacional\n2001\n1990,1994\nSegunda Comunicación Nacional\n2015\nAños pares Serie 1990-2002\n(actualizaciones de 1990,1994)\nFuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.\nEn la 16 Conferencia de las Partes (COP16) con el propósito de\nreportar los avances en la implementación de los objetivos de la\nCMNUCC se estableció que los países en desarrollo deben entregar Informes Bienales de Actualización (IBA) con información actualizada sobre\nlos inventarios nacionales de gases de efecto invernadero18 (en lo adelante INGEI).\nPosteriormente, en la COP17 de 2011 se definió que los países en desarrollo deberían presentar su primer IBA (…) abarcando, como\nmínimo, un año civil anterior en no más de cuatro años a la fecha de\npresentación.19\n18 Decisión 1, párrafo 60(c) del Informe de la Conferencia de las Partes sobre su 16º período\nde sesiones, celebrado en Cancún del 29 de noviembre al 10 de diciembre de 2010.\n19 Decisión 1, párrafo 41(a) Informe de la Conferencia de las Partes sobre su 17º período de\nsesiones, celebrado en Durban del 28 de noviembre al 11 de diciembre de 2011.\n\n90\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nPara la elaboración de estos documentos los equipos técnicos de\nINGEI de los países se basan en las siguientes guías metodológicas:\n• Directrices de la Convención para los IBA de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención (Anexo III de la Decisión 2/CP.17)\n• Directrices para la elaboración de las Comunicaciones Nacionales de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención\n(Anexo de la Decisión 17/CP.8)\nCuba, simultáneamente con su 3CN, presenta su primer IBA, que\nincluye el INGEI para el año 2016 y la serie 1990-2016. El inventario se elaboró siguiendo las Directrices del Panel Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (Directrices del\nIPCC 2006) según la disponibilidad de datos de actividad para los\ncálculos y siguiendo los principios de transparencia, exhaustividad, coherencia, comparabilidad y exactitud.\nAbarca todo el territorio nacional e incluye las emisiones y absorciones de GEI de origen antropogénico no controlados por el\nProtocolo de Montreal. En este capítulo se describe el proceso llevado a cabo para la elaboración del INGEI, la metodología empleada, los resultados de las emisiones y absorciones de GEI del\npaís, así como las actualizaciones y mejoras incorporadas respecto\na reportes anteriores, entre otros aspectos relacionados con el reporte de los inventarios nacionales de GEI.\nEn la Tercera Comunicación Nacional (TCN) también se incluye un reporte de este capítulo para la misma serie de tiempo.\n2.1.1 Arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del\ninventario\nDesde mediados de la década de 1990 el INSMET coordina la elaboración y presentación del INGEI, bajo la responsabilidad de un\n“Equipo Técnico de Gases de Efecto Invernadero” (ETGEI). Este\nequipo lo lidera un Coordinador General y está integrado por expertos del INSMET y de los equipos de trabajo de cada sector involucrado en el inventario. El ETGEI responde por la elaboración,\nverificación, validación, y actualización sistemática del INGEI, la\npreparación de los informes para las comunicaciones nacionales y\nlos IBA, y por la información que requiera el Sistema Nacional de\nInformación y Estadística.\n\n91\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas instituciones que participan en la elaboración del INGEI\npertenecen a los ministerios relacionados con los sectores que generan las emisiones y las absorciones de GEI; también participan\nautoridades ambientales, instituciones públicas, académicas y productivas. Entre los participantes es relevante la Oficina Nacional de\nEstadísticas e Información (ONEI), institución transversal para todos los sectores, que compila y certifica los datos oficiales del país.\nLas instituciones involucradas con el inventario proveen datos\nde actividad, así como paramétricos y específicos necesarios para\nlas estimaciones. Por otra parte, aportan juicio de expertos, certificación de datos y revisión de informes, como parte del control de\nla calidad, exhaustividad y transparencia requeridos. Lo anterior\npermite refinar las estadísticas nacionales y determinar factores de\nemisión propios de país.\nLos sectores incluidos en el inventario, según las Directrices del\nIPCC de 2006 son: Energía, Procesos Industriales y Uso de Productos (IPPU por sus siglas en inglés), Agricultura, Silvicultura y Otros\nUsos de la Tierra (AFOLU, por sus siglas en inglés) y Desechos.\nLos arreglos institucionales del INGEI se muestran en la figura 2.1.\n Figura 2.1 Arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del INGEI en Cuba.

El diagrama\ndel ciclo del inventario, que se muestra en la figura 2.2, comprende\nseis ciclos de diferente duración en los cuales se exponen las actividades fundamentales para la elaboración del INGEI. En el caso\nde Cuba el inventario se realiza, actualmente, cada dos años.\nEl actual ciclo presenta la información relevante que se debe\nconsiderar y adoptar con el fin de reflejar los arreglos institucionales en el programa de desarrollo del inventario (tabla 2.2).

Para la\nestimación de la incertidumbre se tienen en cuenta además las\norientaciones del IPCC contenidas en las Directrices de buenas prácticas (GPG, 2000). La implementación de las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006 constituye un paso significativo respecto a reportes anteriores en los cuales se seguían fundamentalmente las Guías Revisadas\ndel IPCC de 1996.\nSe incluyen las emisiones y absorciones nacionales anuales de\nla serie 1990-2016 para los cuatro sectores contemplados en las\nDirectrices del IPCC de 2006.\n2.1.3.1 Metodologías\nLas metodologías utilizadas para compilar los datos de cada sector\nson comparables, lo que posibilita la comparabilidad de los resultados obtenidos. En cada sector, se incluyeron las categorías y subcategorías fuentes de emisiones y absorciones existentes en el país\nen las cuales se contó con la información necesaria para realizar\nlas estimaciones correspondientes al nivel de desagregación de las\nDirectrices del IPCC de 2006. Algunas categorías y subcategorías no\nfueron estimadas por la falta de datos de actividad.\nTomando en consideración la disponibilidad de datos de actividad, la información sobre los factores de emisión y los parámetros\nnecesarios para las estimaciones, se aplicaron, fundamentalmente,\nmétodos de Nivel 1, con factores de emisión por defecto y datos\nde actividad generados por instituciones nacionales. En algunas\nfuentes se aplicaron métodos de Nivel 2, con factores de emisión\npropios de país y por defecto. Estos métodos de estimación son:\nMétodo de Nivel 1: Es el “método por defecto”, la instancia metodológica más simple, aplicable cuando no se cuenta con datos de\nactividad propios o factores de emisión país específicos. Si bien el\nmétodo Nivel 1 permite hacer el cálculo, tiene el riesgo de que las\ncircunstancias nacionales no sean debidamente reflejadas.\n\n96\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nMétodo de Nivel 2: Se basa en el mismo procedimiento metodológico del Nivel 1, pero con factores de emisión o datos de actividad paramétricos propios del país o de una región. En estas\ncircunstancias, es altamente probable que las estimaciones de absorciones y emisiones de GEI sean más precisas, por lo cual esta\nopción debiera aplicarse a las categorías principales.\nMétodo Nivel 3: Corresponde a métodos específicos de un país\n(modelos, mediciones in situ censos y otros), cuya aplicación se\nrecomienda siempre que hayan sido debidamente validados.\nLos cálculos se realizaron a partir de la ecuación base que se muestra a continuación utilizando el software del IPCC del 2006 y hojas\nde cálculo desarrolladas por el ETGEI en base a las Directrices del\nIPCC, 2006.\nEcuación 2.1. Método de cálculo de las emisiones de GEI.\nEmisiones=Datos Actividad (DA) *Factor de Emisión (FE)\nTras estimar las emisiones y absorciones de cada GEI en las diversas fuentes se reportan los valores de GEI en forma agregada,\nexpresados en dióxido de carbono equivalente (CO2eq). Fueron\nusados los Potenciales de Calentamiento Global (PCG o GWP por\nsus siglas en inglés) proporcionados por el IPCC en su Segundo Informe de Evaluación en 1995 (SAR por sus siglas en ingles), que se\nbasan en los efectos de los GEI en un horizonte temporal de cien\naños.

La información primaria utilizada proviene de los Anuarios Estadísticos publicados por la ONEI,\nsin embargo, en la actualidad, estos datos cubren solamente solo\nuna parte de la información necesaria para realizar las estimaciones, por lo que se solicita información a los diferentes ministerios\ne instituciones (según figura 2.1) ya que estas no son publicadas por\nla ONEI. A continuación, se describen de forma general las principales fuentes de información para cada sector.\nSector Energía. La ONEI y el Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MINEM) son las dos principales fuentes de información sobre datos\nde actividad (consumo y producción de combustibles) en el país.\nDichas instituciones son las encargadas de la elaboración del Balance Energético Nacional (BEN) en el cual se encuentra la información de producción, oferta interna y consumo nacional de todos los\ncombustibles por los diferentes sectores económicos del país.\nSe obtuvo además, información complementaria desde el Centro de Gestión y Desarrollo de la Energía (CUBAENERGÍA), el\nCentro de Investigaciones y Manejo Ambiental del Transporte (CIMAB), el Ministerio de Transporte (MITRANS), el Ministerio de\nIndustrias (MINDUS), el Grupo Empresarial AZCUBA, el Ministerio de la Agricultura (MINAG), el Ministerio de la Construcción\n(MICONS), así como otras pertenecientes al MINEM.\nSector IPPU. Se cuenta con datos de actividad estadísticos fundamentalmente de producción de diversas sustancias publicados\npor la ONEI, además de otros datos de actividad y paramétricos\nmás refinados aportados por el Ministerio de la Construcción (MICONS), por el Ministerio de Industrias (MINDUS), por el Centro\nde Investigaciones de la Industria Química (CIIQ) y el Grupo Empresarial de la Industria Sideromecánica (GESIME). A partir de esta\ninformación más detallada fue posible la aplicación de un método\nde Nivel 2 en algunas fuentes de emisión. Además, por medio de\ncriterio de expertos se determinó la No Ocurrencia (NO) para algunas subcategorías de la Industria Química.\nSector AFOLU. Se utilizaron varias fuentes de información, tanto\nde datos estadísticos como paramétricos. En la ONEI se publica\nuna cantidad significativa de información referente a la ganade-\n\n98\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nría y a los cultivos en Cuba, con datos certificados por el MINAG\ny sus instituciones especializadas, incluido el Grupo Empresarial\nGanadero (GEGAN). Diversos datos paramétricos de alimentación\ny sistemas de manejo del ganado fueron provistos por otras instituciones académicas del Ministerio de Educación Superior (MES),\ncomo el Instituto de Ciencia Animal (ICA), y la Estación Experimental de Pastos y Forrajes Indio Hatuey (EEPFIH).\nEl aporte de estas entidades, de conjunto con un grupo de expertos\ninternacionales,22 fue determinante en la refinación de los datos de\nactividad referentes a poblaciones ganaderas, alimentación animal\ny manejo del estiércol del ganado en el país para la estimación de\nlas emisiones en las categorías 3.A Ganadería y 3.C Fuentes agregadas\ny fuentes de emisión no CO2 de la tierra.\nLos datos de las categorías forestales se obtuvieron desde el\nInstituto de Investigaciones Agroforestales (INAF) perteneciente al\nGrupo Agroforestal del MINAG. Se obtuvieron además datos estadísticos y paramétricos desde el Instituto de Suelos (IS) y para\nel caso del cultivo del arroz criterios de expertos procedentes del\nInstituto de Investigaciones de Granos (IIG).\nSector Desechos. Las fuentes de datos de actividad y paramétricos\nde mayor importancia son la ONEI la cual publica toda la información estadística referente a la cantidad de población en el país; las\nEmpresas de Servicios Comunales y el Ministerio de Economía y\nPlanificación (MEP) que tributan datos referentes a la generación\nde desechos sólidos; el Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidráulicos (INRH) que provee información concerniente a los sistemas de\nmanejo de aguas residuales tanto domésticas como industriales.\nOtra fuente de información en este sector la constituye el MINDUS para el caso de las aguas residuales industriales.\nPartidas informativas\nComo parte del módulo de energía, también se estimaron los elementos\ninformativos referentes a Bunkers internacionales y Emisiones de CO2\npor quema de biomasa, que se muestran en el Anexo 3.\nComo buena práctica, se realizó la estimación de las emisiones\nde GEI por 1.A. Quema de combustibles por el método de referencia.\nEn el Anexo 4 se presentan los resultados obtenidos.\n22 En julio de 2019 se realizó en La Habana un Taller de fortalecimiento de capacidades para\nel sector AFOLU del INGEI de Cuba con la participación de varios expertos internacionales.\n\n99\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.1.3.3 Factores de emisión\nLos factores de emisión utilizados en su mayoría, fueron por defecto de nivel 1 tomados de las Directrices del IPPC de 2006.\nSector Energía. Para el cálculo de las emisiones de CO2, CH4 y\nN2O para las subcategorías del grupo 1.A. Quema de combustibles y\nsubcategorías del grupo 1.B. Emisiones Fugitivas se emplearon factores de emisión por defecto de Nivel 1. Aunque se han realizado\nestudios de factores de emisión propios para los diferentes combustibles del país, estos aún están pendientes de revisión y ajustes,\npor lo que se utilizaron los factores procedentes de las Directrices\ndel IPCC de 2006. Para el próximo ciclo del INGEI se utilizarán\nlos factores de emisión propios por tipo de combustible en el país.\nSector IPPU. Los factores de emisión empleados en este sector\npertenecientes a las categorías 2.A. Industria de los Minerales, 2.B.\nIndustria Química y 2.C. Industria de los metales fueron por defecto de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 tanto para Nivel 1 como\nNivel 2. Solamente en el caso de las emisiones relacionadas con la\nProducción de cemento fue posible obtener un factor de emisión\npropio de país para cada año de la serie aplicándose un método de\nNivel 2.\nSector AFOLU. Se utilizaron, en mayoría, factores de emisión\npor defecto provenientes de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nSin embargo, para la subcategoría 3.A.1 Fermentación entérica se\nutilizaron factores de emisión propios de país mediante juicio de\nexpertos del sector en Cuba, expertos asesores de Colombia y el\nETGEI de Cuba en el taller realizado.\nSector Desechos. Para este sector se utilizó el método de descomposición de primer orden (FOD, por sus siglas en inglés) de acuerdo con las Directrices del IPCC de 2006, manteniendo algunos\nparámetros por defecto y agregando datos específicos de país. Para\nel caso de las aguas residuales tanto domésticas como industriales\nse utilizaron factores de emisión por defecto provenientes de las\nDirectrices del IPCC 2006.\nLas metodologías y fuentes de información empleadas para la estimación de las emisiones de GEI por componentes, subcategorías, subsectores y sectores se muestran en el Anexo 1.\n\n100\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos métodos y criterios metodológicos utilizados para la estimación del INGEI de Cuba, serie 1990-2016 se muestran en el\nAnexo 2 (emisiones provenientes de las diferentes categorías y\nsubcategorías de fuente, tanto para los datos de actividad, factores\nde emisión y los diferentes GEI según las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006).\n2.1.4 Evaluación de la incertidumbre\nLa información sobre incertidumbres, no está destinada a disputar\nla validez de los estimados del inventario, sino para ayudar a priorizar los esfuerzos para mejorar la seguridad de este en el futuro y\nguiar las decisiones acerca de las elecciones metodológicas.\nAunque, para la mayor parte de los países y categorías de fuentes, los estimados de emisiones de gases de invernadero son razonablemente seguros, los reportes del inventario preparados\nutilizando las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 normalmente contienen un amplio rango de estimados de emisiones con diferente\ngrado de calidad.\nSegún las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 y sus orientaciones sobre\nbuenas prácticas y gestión de incertidumbre, la propagación de\nerror (Método 1) y el método de Montecarlo (Método 2) son los\nmétodos más utilizados para la estimación de la incertidumbre de\nemisiones.\nLa serie temporal de inventarios reportada en este IBA utiliza\nsolamente el método 1 de propagación de errores que supone que\nlos errores son pequeños y simétricos, requiere de la determinación\nde expresiones matemáticas de la varianza de una estimación. Estas\nexpresiones a veces resultan ser relativamente extensas y complejas\ny, por tanto, son propensas a errores humanos de cálculo.\nEn la sección 2.4 se presenta el resultado del análisis de la estimación de las incertidumbres para este INGEI.\n2.1.5 Análisis de categorías clave\nLas Directrices del IPCC de 2006 establecen dos criterios para la\nidentificación de categorías clave. Cada uno contempla dos análisis:\n• La evaluación del nivel, en la cual se evalúa la influencia de\ncada una de las emisiones en cada categoría con respecto a las\nemisiones totales en el último año del inventario, y\n\n101\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n• La evaluación de tendencia, en la cual se evalúa el aporte del\ncambio de emisiones de cada categoría en el cambio de emisiones o absorciones totales, entre el último año y un año de\nreferencia.\nExisten dos métodos para cada criterio de evaluación (el método 2,\na diferencia del método 1, integra en el análisis el valor de la incertidumbre como criterio de selección).\nPara la selección de las categorías claves del inventario nacional\nde emisiones GEI para la serie 1990-2016, se llevaron a cabo los\ncuatro análisis disponibles apoyados en la herramienta de cálculo\npara categorías claves versión 2.5 procedentes de las Directrices\ndel IPCC de 2006. En la sección 2.5 se muestra un análisis más\ndetallado de las categorías claves.\nTabla 2.4 Métodos y ecuaciones utilizados para la determinación\nde categorías clave\nMétodo 1\nNivel\nEcuación 4.1, volumen 1, capítulo\n4.

No obstante, para la\nelaboración del correspondiente a la serie 1990-2016, se han llevado a cabo acciones encaminadas a mejorar y establecer una ruta de\ntrabajo que garantice la permanencia en el tiempo del análisis, la\ngestión y el aseguramiento de la calidad. Estos procesos de control\ny aseguramiento de la calidad (QA/QC, por sus siglas en inglés)\n\n102\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\ndotan al inventario de una mayor consistencia y certidumbre en\nsus resultados. El control y el análisis están dirigidos a mejorar la\ncalidad de entrada de los datos de actividad y a la verificación de\nlos factores de emisión utilizados.\nEs un proceso continuo que comienza con el análisis de las categorías estimadas y no estimadas. Las categorías que no se han\npodido estimar, por falta de datos de actividad o de las metodologías apropiadas, y las que se certificaron que no ocurren en el país\nse han reportado usando claves de notación en el Anexo 2.\nComo parte del proceso de control de calidad una vez concluidos los informes de cada sector, se compartieron con expertos\nsectoriales, con el objetivo de esclarecer y revisar las estimaciones\nrealizadas. Este proceso contribuyó a mejorar la calidad de los informes, a certificar la información contenida en los mismos y a la\npresentación de los resultados en el primer IBA.\nEn la tabla 2.26 de la sección 2.6, como parte del plan de mejoramiento, se presentan determinadas acciones que responden a un\nproceso más riguroso de control de la calidad en el INGEI del país.\n2.2 Tendencia de las emisiones agregadas por\nsectores para la serie 1990-2016.\nLas emisiones totales brutas en 2016 se contabilizaron en 50,213.7\nktCO2eq., (tabla 2.7 y figura 2.3).

La subcategoría 1.A.1. Industrias de la energía es\nla principal emisora representando el 60.2 % de las emisiones\ndel sector y la componente Generación de electricidad como\nactividad principal representa el 43.3 % de las emisiones entre\ntodas las componentes y subcategorías, considerándose como la\nmás importante tanto en el resto de la serie como en el 2016.\n23 El proyecto ENERGAS, empresa mixta entre operada con capital cubano de Cuba a través\nde la Unión CUPET y la UNE y capital de Canadá por medio de la Sherrit International.\nDisponible en https://www.sherritt.com/English/operations/power/default.aspx.\n\n113\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nEsto se debe a que en el país prácticamente toda la electricidad se\ngenera en centrales termoeléctricas, baterías de motores que consumen diésel y fuel oíl y motores de emergencia a base de diésel. A\npartir del año 2006, el país llevó a cabo un proceso conocido como\nla “Revolución Energética” en el que se llevaron a cabo varias acciones en aras de mejorar el sistema eléctrico nacional, con la entrada\nde una mayor cantidad de plantas generadoras y nuevas tecnologías\nde generación en algunas de las termoeléctricas del país.\nA partir de 2007 comienza un convenio de colaboración con la\nRepública Bolivariana de Venezuela (CUVENPETROL), para refinar grandes cantidades24 de carburantes en la Refinería de Cienfuegos al centro de la isla, por ello las elevadas emisiones en los\naños 2007 y 2008 respectivamente.\nLas emisiones de las 1.A.2. Industrias manufactureras y de la\nconstrucción representaron el 16.3 %. Esta subcategoría comprende tres tipos de industrias principales desagregadas en (Industria\nazucarera, Explotación de minas y canteras y Construcción). Las\ndemás industrias se agregaron en la componente Otras industrias\nmanufactureras. Si bien la esfera industrial en el país sufrió un\ndecrecimiento a inicios del período analizado, en la actualidad se\nencuentra en segundo lugar en cuanto a emisiones del sector se\nrefiere. Aunque aún no se rebasan las emisiones del año base, las\nnuevas inversiones y la elevación de los niveles de producción nacional requeridos, producirán un aumento de las emisiones en el\nsector a corto plazo.\nLas emisiones fugitivas de la subcategoría 1.B.2. Petróleo y Gas\nNatural alcanzaron el 12.1 %, experimentando un crecimiento continuo sobre todo a partir de 1997, cuando se comienzan a explotar\nlos yacimientos en la costa norte occidental del país y se crea la\nempresa mixta ENERGAS, la entrada de plantas de ciclo combinado para la generación eléctrica y el creciente consumo de gas en\nel sector residencial, han sido las principales causas del aumento\nen los consumos de gas natural y petróleo crudo cubano y con ello\nun aumento en las emisiones fugitivas asociadas a las actividades\nextractivas.\nEl 1.A.3. Transporte (principalmente el Transporte terrestre)\nemitió el 6.2 %. Este es uno de los sectores que más ha reducido las\nemisiones desde 1990, cuando representaba el 23 % de las emisiones de la categoría y el 22.3 % de las emisiones del sector Energía.\n24 La renovación de la refinería de Cienfuegos se encontraba inactiva y la inversión venezolana llevara su capacidad de producción a unos 50000b/pd (Feinberg, 2011).\n\n114\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nEste gran decrecimiento en las emisiones tiene su causa principal en la crisis experimentada por el país a inicios de la década de\nlos 90, y, posteriormente por el recrudecimiento del bloqueo estadounidense, que trajo consigo un deterioro en todas las ramas del\ntransporte, desplomándose de manera casi total la flota marítima\ny ferroviaria del país. En el transporte por carretera y la aviación\nlos impactos fueron menores, pero también tuvieron sus consecuencias, los bajos niveles de consumo de combustibles, por la disminución de vehículos circulando en el país, y la disminución del\ntransporte aéreo de cabotaje, incidieron de manera importante en\nlas reducciones de las emisiones hacia finales del período analizado.\nPor último, el sector denominado 1.A.4. Otros sectores (principalmente Residencial) representó el 5.3 % de las emisiones totales.\nDentro de este sector también se ha registrado un descenso en las\nemisiones, sobre todo en el sector residencial que representaba en\n1990, el 7.1 % de las emisiones totales de la subcategoría y en 2016\nsolo el 2.4 %.\nEste marcado decrecimiento es debido, casi en su totalidad, a la\nreducción en los consumos combustibles líquidos en los hogares,\ncomo el querosene y la sustitución de este por gas licuado de petróleo y cocinas de inducción que utilizan electricidad. Los componentes Comercial/Institucional y Agricultura/Silvicultura y Pesca,\nmantuvieron un comportamiento similar en toda la serie. La subcategoría Combustibles sólidos se reporta como NO - No Ocurre,\nsegún las metodologías de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nTabla 2.12 Sector Energía.

En 2016 las emisiones del sector llegaron a 776.3 ktCO2eq., representando el 1.6 %\nde las emisiones totales del país excluyendo FOLU, estos niveles\nde emisiones fueron un 73.6 % y 8.1 % inferiores a las correspondientes a 1990 y al 2014 respectivamente. Este es el sector que menos emisiones genera en el INGEI.\nEste sector es donde más se evidenció la crisis económica sufrida a inicios de la década de los 90, lo que se manifiesta claramente\nen la serie analizada para el INGEI. Las emisiones de 2016 por categorías, son inferiores a las de 1990, y para algunas categorías del\n2014.\nLa categoría 2.A. Industria de los minerales (tabla 2.15 y figura\n2.15) es la de mayores emisiones del sector con 709.2 ktCO2eq. para\nun 91.4 %, siendo un 57.2 % menores que las de 1990 y en 5.7 % desde\nel 2014.\nLa categoría 2.B. Industria Química con 50.8 ktCO2eq., representó el 6.5 % de las emisiones, siendo inferiores en 94 % con respecto a 1990 y en 29.5 % desde el 2014. La pronunciada caída de\nestas emisiones en comparación con 1990 se debe a que en ese año\nlas producciones de amoníaco generaron el 67.3 % de las emisiones, y a partir de 1992 dejó de producirse en el país.\nPor último, la categoría 2.C. Industria de los metales con 16.4\nktCO2eq. representa el 2.1 % restante, estando por debajo de las\nemisiones de 1990 y 2014 en un 96.3 % y 20.4 % respectivamente.\nEl pronunciado descenso con respecto al año base se debe a que,\nen ese año, funcionaban en la principal acería del país “hornos de\nsolera” (OHF) que, según datos brindados por el GESIME, en 1992\nfueron reemplazados por hornos de arco eléctrico (EAF), lo que\nprodujo un cambio de factores de emisión para realizar las estimaciones según lo establecido en el cuadro 4.1, Volumen 3, Capítulo 4,\npágina 4.28 de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nLa notable diferencia existente entre los factores de emisión\npara ambas tecnologías (1.72 tonCO2/ton de acero, para hornos de\nsolera y 0,08 tonCO2/ton de acero, para hornos de arco eléctrico)\ninfluyó de manera significativa en la reducción de las emisiones,\nya que en 2016 se produjo un 27.4 % más de acero que en 1992\n(último año de producción con horno de solera), sin embargo, las\nemisiones fueron un 84 % menores.\n\n118\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.15 Sector IPPU.

Producción de cemento es la de mayor relevancia del sector con un\n86.6 %, seguida de la 2.B.2. Producción de ácido nítrico con un 6.5 %,\nle siguen en orden de importancia la 2.A.2. Producción de cal con el\n4.8 % y por último la 2.C.1. Producción de hierro, acero y coque metalúrgico con el 2.1 % restante. Estas últimas tres subcategorías manifestaron emisiones inferiores a 1990 en un 72.7 %, 80.9 % y 96.3 %\nrespectivamente. De igual manera se comportan con respecto al\n2014, donde fueron inferiores en 5.7 %, 5.6 %, 29.5 % y 20.4 %.\nEn algunas subcategorías se estimaron las emisiones para los\naños en los que se dispuso de información y para las que se produ-\n\n119\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\ncían que en la actualidad no se cuenta con datos de actividad para\nsu estimación. Estas subcategorías son 2.A.3. Producción de vidrio\n(años pares desde 1990 al 2004), 2.B.1. Producción de amoníaco\n(1990 y 1991), 2.B.5. Producción de carburo de calcio (años pares\ndesde 1990 al 2004).\nEn 2016, la producción de cemento contabilizó 672 ktCO2eq.\nregistrando valores de emisiones inferiores con respecto al año\n1990 en 55.4 % y 5.7 % en relación con el 2014. Es la subcategoría\nque más influye en la tendencia y las principales variaciones a lo\nlargo de la serie. Las causas fundamentales de la disminución de\nlas emisiones se deben al denominado Período Especial en Tiempos de Paz, provocado por la desaparición del campo socialista y el\nrecrudecimiento del bloqueo de los Estados Unidos contra Cuba.\nEn los años 2006 y 2007 aumentan las emisiones, en gran medida por un aumento en las actividades constructivas en el sector\nresidencial y en instalaciones turísticas. Sin embargo, después del\naño 2013, las emisiones generadas por esta subcategoría disminuyeron debido a falta de financiamiento para la modernización del\nequipamiento que permita alcanzar mejores niveles productivos.\nPara el caso de la producción de ácido nítrico en 2016, se emitieron 50.8 ktCO2eq., lo que representó un 80.9 % inferior a las\nemisiones de 1990 y el 29.5 % desde el 2014. La variabilidad de las\nemisiones en la subcategoría responde a la situación económica\ndel país y a la disponibilidad de materias primas para para la producción de ácido nítrico.\nLa producción de cal sumó en el último año de la serie un total\nde 37.2 ktCO2eq. emitidos, siendo inferiores a las de 1990 en un\n72.7 % y 5.6 % con respecto al 2014. Al igual que la producción de\ncemento, la causa principal de las disminuciones en la subcategoría es la crisis económica sufrida en el país a inicios de los 90. Las\ncausantes de la variabilidad de las emisiones a lo largo de la serie\nestán relacionadas con el mantenimiento de las plantas y con la\nobsolescencia y modernización de las tecnologías productivas.\nLa subcategoría que menos emite dentro del sector es la producción de hierro, acero y coque metalúrgico con 16.4 ktCO2eq. en\n2016. Este valor representó una disminución con respecto a 1990\ndel 96.3 % y del 20.4 % desde el 2014. La causante de tal reducción\nfue el cambio metodológico de los factores de emisión asociados a\nnuevas tecnologías para la producción de acero en el país.\n\n120\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.16 Sector IPPU.

Fuentes agregadas y fuentes de emisión no CO2 de la tierra mantienen un comportamiento similar a lo largo de la serie analizada, ocurriendo las mayores\nemisiones en el año 1990 para ambas categorías (tabla 2.19) y el año\n2005 el de menores emisiones tanto para la Ganadería con 4,362.8\nktCO2eq. como para las emisiones de Fuentes agregadas y fuentes\nde emisión no CO2 de la tierra con 4,511.9 ktCO2eq.\nCon respecto a las subcategorías (tabla 2.19 y figura 2.19) la más\nrepresentativa es la 3.A.1. Fermentación entérica con el 36.3 % de\nlas emisiones del sector sin incluir FOLU contabilizando 3,664.9\nktCO2eq., siendo un 3.3 % menores que las generadas por esta subcategoría en 1990 y un 1.5 % menores que en 2014. Esta reducción\nse debe a la disminución en la masa ganadera en el año final con\nrespecto a los dos años de referencia (1990 y 2014) representando\nel 16.3 % y en 2.9 % respectivamente.\nLe siguen en importancia las 3.C.4. Emisiones directas de N2O\nde suelos gestionados, en los que se emitieron 2,814.8 ktCO2eq.,\nrepresentando el 27.8 % de las emisiones sin incluir FOLU, lo que\nrepresentó un 50 % menos que las emisiones generadas en 1990\ny un 2.3 % superiores a las registradas en el 2014. Las reducciones\ncon respecto al año base tienen su origen en la disminución del\nuso de fertilizantes nitrogenados sintéticos ya que se aplicaron casi\n280 mil toneladas menos en 2016 en comparación con 1990, lo\nque representó un 87.5 % menos de fertilizantes usados.\nLas 3.C.6. Emisiones indirectas de N2O generadas por la gestión\nde estiércol representaron en 2016 el 11.9 % con 1,206.04 ktCO2eq.\nde las emisiones sin incluir FOLU, siendo superiores a las de 1990\ny 2014 en 1.1 % y 6.6 % respectivamente. La principal causa del aumento registrado con respecto al 2014 se debió a que en 2016 aumentaron las cabezas de ganado porcino en 274,800 animales para\nun 16.6 % superior.\n\n124\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLa subcategoría 3.A.2 Gestión del estiércol generó 1,148.9 ktCO2eq. en 2016, para el 11.4 % de las emisiones excluyendo FOLU,\nsuperando las emisiones de 1990 en 6.9 % y las de 2014 en un 5 %.\nEste aumento se encuentra originado por el crecimiento de la\nmasa porcina en el país con respecto a esos dos años.\nLa subcategoría 3.C.5. Emisiones indirectas de N2O de suelos\ngestionados representó el 6.9 % del total de las emisiones del sector\nsin incluir FOLU, expulsando 698.3 ktCO2eq. Dicho valor es un\n57.3 % inferior al registrado para 1990 y 0.48 % al alcanzado en 2014.\nEl origen de este decrecimiento se debió se debió a la disminución\nen el uso de fertilizantes nitrogenados.\nLas emisiones relacionadas con la subcategoría 3.C.7 Cultivo\ndel arroz le suceden con 412.2 ktCO2eq., lo que representa el 4.08\n% de las emisiones en 2016 excluyendo FOLU, siendo inferiores a\nlas de 1990 en 9.6 % y a las del 2014 en 18.4 %. Al tener las emisiones\ndel arroz relación directa con el área sembrada, esta constituyó la\nprincipal causa de las reducciones al compararlas con el año base\ny al 2014, ya que se dejaron de sembrar unas 14,880 hectáreas (ha)\ny 31,556 ha con respecto a esos años.\nEl país tiene una política de incrementar la producción arrocera en el país, y, con la introducción de nuevas tecnologías se ha\nlogrado incrementar los rendimientos entre 0,8 y 1,6 t/ha (Pérez y\nPenichet, 2014), lo que hace que las producciones no se vean tan\nafectadas por la reducción de las áreas de siembra.\nLas restantes subcategorías 3.B.1.a.iv.

Por su parte, las incertidumbres introducidas en la tendencia en las emisiones nacionales totales son del 90.1 %.\nEn términos generales, los sectores que más aportan a la incertidumbre (contribución a la varianza) del 2016 son AFOLU y\nDesechos seguidos de Energía e IPPU.\nEn el sector Energía, la incertidumbre combinada total fue de\n-16.0 % y +45.5 % en 2016. Las fuentes de incertidumbre que en\nmayor medida contribuyen a la varianza se encuentran en las emi-\n\n132\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsiones fugitivas de CH4 en la extracción de petróleo, seguidas\nde las emisiones de CO2 en los combustibles líquidos para las\nindustrias de la energía y las emisiones de CO2 por el consumo\nde combustibles líquidos en Industrias Manufactureras y de la\nconstrucción.\nLa incertidumbre del sector se explica por los altos valores en\nel uso de factores de emisión por defecto, específicamente para\nel caso de las emisiones de CH4 y N2O en el uso de la biomasa en\nindustrias de la energía y en las emisiones fugitivas por petróleo\ny gas natural, más que por los datos de actividad levantados en el\nBalance Energético Nacional y otras estadísticas consultadas.\nEl sector IPPU presentó una incertidumbre combinada de ± 2.1 %.\nLas fuentes de incertidumbre que más contribuyen a la varianza\nson las emisiones de CO2 en la producción de cemento, seguidas\nde las emisiones de N2O en la producción de ácido nítrico. El principal elemento que influye en las incertidumbres del sector es el\nuso de factores de emisión por defecto, sobre todo en el caso de las\nemisiones de N2O en la producción de ácido nítrico.\nEn el sector AFOLU, la incertidumbre combinada total fue de\n-34.3 % y +51.6 % para el año 2016. Las fuentes de incertidumbre\nque más contribuyen a la varianza se encuentran las absorciones\nde CO2 en las tierras forestales que permanecen como tales, así\ncomo las emisiones indirectas de N2O provenientes de la gestión\ndel estiércol y las emisiones directas de N2O en los suelos gestionados, específicamente por la componente orina y estiércol\ndepositado en pastizales, prados y praderas. En general, la incertidumbre del sector se debe a los numerosos datos paramétricos,\nen su mayoría utilizados por defecto, principalmente en la subcategoría 3.C Fuentes agregadas y fuentes de emisión no CO2 de\nla tierra.\nEn el sector Desechos, la incertidumbre combinada total fue\nde -10.2 % y 16.2 % en 2016. Las fuentes que más contribuyen a la\nvarianza son las emisiones de CH4 en los sitios de disposición de\ndesechos sólidos no categorizados, seguidas de las emisiones de\nCH4 en el tratamiento y eliminación de aguas residuales domésticas e industriales. En general, la incertidumbre del sector se debe\nal uso de parámetros y factores de emisión por defecto, tanto en\nlas emisiones de CH4 por la disposición de desechos sólidos como\nen las emisiones de CH4 del tratamiento y eliminación de aguas\nresiduales domésticas.\n\n133\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.5 Análisis de categorías clave\nLa Tabla 2.24 muestra en filas las fuentes de emisión y absorción\nidentificadas como categorías clave marcadas con X, las columnas\nindican el criterio de identificación según las Directrices del IPCC\nde 2006.

Tierras (a excepción de la Subcategoría 3.B.1.a Tierras Forestales que permanecen como tales calculadas usando las\nGuías Revisadas del IPCC de 1996).\nA partir de este notable vacío, la experiencia desarrollada por\nel IDEAM de Colombia en el Sector AFOLU en general y esta\ncategoría en específico, y en el marco del trabajo cooperativo\nde la Red Latinoamericana de Inventarios de Gases de Efecto\nInvernadero (RedINGEI), Cuba solicita el apoyo financiero y\ntécnico del PNUD/GSP para implementar una cooperación entre\nambos países durante 2019 y 2020 con el propósito de estimar las\nemisiones y absorciones de GEI en esta categoría y así mejorar de\nforma considerable el INGEI de Cuba a incluir en los próximos\ncompromisos internacionales.\n\n138\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.6.1 Plan de mejoras\nCon el objetivo de superar estas dificultades se confeccionó un Plan\nde Mejoras como herramienta de apoyo para futuros inventarios,\nen el cual se recogen los puntos críticos y oportunidades de mejoras\ntransversales y sectoriales (tabla 2.26). Este plan de mejoras permite establecer las prioridades para reducir las incertidumbres en los\nresultados y refinar los procesos de transparencia en los reportes en\nfunción de las principales deficiencias encontradas.\nEste plan de mejoras tiene relación con los esfuerzos del país\nen la implementación de las acciones de mitigación, tema de gran\nimportancia a destacar en los futuros INGEI. En el país se han alcanzado avances este sentido con la elaboración de las “Bases generales para el establecimiento de un sistema de Medición Reporte y\nVerificación (MRV) en Cuba” y se encuentra en fase de confección\nla “Hoja de ruta para la implementación de las contribuciones de\nmitigación en las CND en Cuba”.\nLas actividades de mejora planteadas requieren de la participación\nde diferentes entidades del Estado (Ministerios e instituciones asociadas), como de las universidades, centros de investigación, plantas de\nproducción, además de una importante inversión de recursos.\nLas acciones están dirigidas fundamentalmente a dar solución a\nlos vacíos y barreras institucionales encontradas en el proceso de elaboración del último INGEI. Para ello se parte de mapeos, estudios y\nmesas de coordinación con los organismos involucrados en la provisión de datos de actividad, datos paramétricos que permitan refinar\nfactores de emisión propios de país y la determinación de criterio\nde expertos. En dichos estudios y mesas quedarán identificadas las\nnecesidades de datos para las diferentes componentes, las fuentes\nprimarias de los datos, la captación de los mismos por los sistemas\nestadísticos, (territoriales, complementarios y nacional), así como la\ndisponibilidad periódica de los mismos. A partir de ello serán elaborados y formalizados los arreglos institucionales, con amparo legal,\nentre las instituciones identificadas y el ETGEI y un plan de trabajo\nen el cual se definen las principales actividades a realizar por cada\nuna de las partes para el próximo ciclo del INGEI.\nOtro aspecto a destacar es la ejecución, en la actualidad, de un proyecto que tributa a la elaboración de un “Sistema Nacional de Inventario de emisiones de GEI” (SINGEI). Dicho proyecto proveerá las bases\nesenciales para el fortalecimiento de la actividad realizada por el ETGEI y permitirá la permanencia en el tiempo de dicho proceso ya que\ndotará al INGEI de mayor exhaustividad, confiabilidad y transparencia.\n\n139\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.26 Principales vacíos y barreras encontrados en el proceso de elaboración del INGEI 1990-2016 tanto a nivel de aspectos\ntransversales como a nivel sectorial.

Acciones de mitigación\n3.1 Visión general\nComo se abordó en el epígrafe 2.2 de este documento, en el 2016,\núltimo año en el que se estimaron las emisiones de GEI en Cuba,\nen la estructura de las emisiones totales brutas en ese año se contabilizaron en 50,213.7 ktCO2eq., las absorciones de CO2 fueron de\n27,147.20 ktCO2eq., dando como resultado unas 23,066.5 ktCO2eq.\nde emisiones netas. De las emisiones totales brutas de GEI, el 70.5 %\ncorresponden al sector Energía, las que sumadas con las del sector\nAFOLU, totalizan el 90.7 % de las emisiones del país.\nTeniendo en cuenta el aporte sectorial al inventario nacional\nde GEI, los sectores priorizados para la reducción de emisiones,\nen la etapa actual, son el sector de energía y la agricultura. En estos\nsectores se concentran los esfuerzos del país en la identificación e\nimplementación de las medidas de mitigación.\nSi bien Cuba ha realizado un esfuerzo importante en la conducción de programas que han conllevado a la reducción de las\nemisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, en el país no ha existido\nun sistema que identifique claramente, formule, registre y de seguimiento a esas acciones, desde el punto de vista de la mitigación.\nPara superar esta situación se ha adoptado un enfoque general\npara el diseño e implementación de un Marco de Transparencia\nReforzado bajo el Acuerdo de París (ver punto 4.1), que ha incluido el documento Bases Generales para el establecimiento de un\nSistema MRV en Cuba, que incluye el sistema para las acciones\nde mitigación.\nEl primer esfuerzo de análisis colectivo, a diferentes niveles\nsectoriales y de gobierno, enfocado en la identificación de acciones de mitigación, se realizó durante la formulación, análisis y comunicación de las INDC del país en el año 2015.\nEse proceso tendría un importante impacto en la formulación\ny aprobación de prioridades relacionadas con la mitigación, expresadas en el PNDES 2030 y en la Tarea Vida. En esos documentos, como se analiza en los puntos 1.20 y 1.21, se va más allá de lo\ndeclarado en las CND en cuanto a sectores y objetivos estratégicos.\n\n152\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas contribuciones de mitigación declaradas por el país en su\nCND26 son:\n1.\tLa instalación, sobre la base de fuentes renovables de energía,\nde 2144 MW de potencia conectada a la red eléctrica nacional,\nque incluye la construcción de:\n• 19 bioeléctricas anexas a los centrales azucareros con\n755 MW a partir de la biomasa cañera y forestal.\n• 13 parques eólicos con 633 MW.\n• 700 MW Fotovoltaicos y,\n• 74 pequeñas centrales hidroeléctricas\n2.\tLa instalación de 200 mil m2 de calentadores solares en los\nsectores residencial e industrial.\n3.\tLa instalación de bombas solares en la agricultura.\n4.\tEl aprovechamiento de los residuos orgánicos para la producción de biogás y la obtención de bioabonos que remplazan\nfertilizantes químicos coadyuvará a la reducción de las emisiones y a la disminución de la contaminación de cuencas hidrográficas y bahías. Especial atención tienen los residuos de\nla producción animal, la industria y los sólidos urbanos.\n5.\tLa instalación de tecnología LED con la distribución de 13 millones de lámparas en el sector residencial y de 250 mil luminarias para el alumbrado público.\n6.\tLa sustitución de 2 millones de cocinas eléctricas de resistencia por cocinas de inducción.\nEl desarrollo y encadenamiento de la industria nacional con estos\nprogramas, es un objetivo esencial de la política para la asimilación, desarrollo y producción de equipos y medios para el aprovechamiento de las fuentes renovables y la elevación de la eficiencia\nenergética.\nLas contribuciones del país deberán ser convertidas en acciones\nespecíficas, acercar su formulación a lo establecido en las MPGs\nadoptadas en la COP 24 y ser implementadas bajo el marco de\ntransparencia que se desarrolla en el país. En esa dirección se han\nencaminado los esfuerzos en este período y se han diseñado las\n26 Las contribuciones a que se hace referencia son a las incluidas en la CND actualmente vigente, comunicada por Cuba en el año 2015. En estos momentos se encuentra en proceso\nde aprobación interna la Primera CND Actualizada de la República de Cuba, que deberá\nser comunicada a la CMNUCC próximamente, donde se han manejado cambios en las\ncontribuciones de mitigación con una mayor ambición.\n\n153\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nbases generales de un sistema de MRV que deberá implementarse\na nivel nacional y en los sectores que corresponda para dar cumplimiento a las CND (Ver Capítulo 4 sobre los arreglos institucionales en relación con el MRV).\nEl proceso de identificación, organización e implementación\nde las acciones de mitigación está en curso y es por ello que las\nacciones de mitigación que se reportan en este IBA no están aún\nbajo un sistema MRV, constituyen acciones que se han llevado a\ncabo en diferentes sectores, aun sin un diseño homogéneo y sin un\nseguimiento y reporte sistemático.\n3.2 Resumen sobre el progreso en las acciones\nde mitigación\nComo se planteó antes, no había existido en el país un proceso\nsistémico de identificación y seguimiento de acciones de mitigación. Este proceso dio inicio de forma más colegiada y con un seguimiento de Gobierno a partir de la incorporación de Cuba al\nAcuerdo de París. En este último período se han estado creando\nlas condiciones para iniciar a partir del 2021 la implementación\nadecuada de las acciones de mitigación contenidas en la CND.\nNo obstante, Cuba participó en los instrumentos de la convención: Protocolo de Kioto; NAMAs.\n3.2.1 Proyectos planificados bajo el Mecanismo\nde Desarrollo Limpio (MDL) en Cuba\nBajo el Protocolo de Kioto, aunque de forma tardía al final del primer período del Protocolo, se realizó un trabajo de identificación\nde proyectos bajo el Mecanismo de Desarrollo Limpio (MDL).\nAl finalizar el primer período de implementación del Protocolo\nde Kioto, en el año 2012 se disponía en Cuba de 4 proyectos MDL,\ncon diferente grado de desarrollo y en diferentes etapas de aprobación. Estos proyectos se presentan en la Tabla 3.1.\n\n154\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 3.1 Proyectos planificados bajo el Mecanismo de Desarrollo\nLimpio (MDL) en Cuba, al finalizar el año 2012\nNo.\nTítulo del proyecto\nEstado del proyecto\nMDL al cierre del\naño 2012\nCERs esperados\n1.\nENERGAS Varadero: conversión de ciclo abierto a ciclo combinado.\nExpedición de CER\n342,235.00\ntCO2eq./año\n2.\nCaptura y destrucción de CH4 en el vertedero de Calle 100, en La Habana; y\nGascón, en Santiago de Cuba27 .\nExpedición de CER\n123,162.00\ntCO2eq./año\n3.\nENERGAS Jaruco: conversión de ciclo\nabierto a ciclo combinado.\nValidación internacional\n607,335.00 t/\nCO2eq./año\n4.\nReducción de las emisiones de CO2 en\nla producción de cementos con aditivos\nen Cementos Cienfuegos S.A.

No obstante, los dos restantes (No. 1 y 3)\nreferidos a la conversión de ciclo abierto a ciclo combinado en\nEnergas Varadero y Energas Jaruco se ejecutaron como estaba concebido en los proyectos MDL. En el período comprendido entre\nlos años 2012 al 2016 en estas plantas se generó una electricidad\nde 12.7 TWh. Se ha estimado que en ese período se ha producido\nuna reducción total de emisiones de 4.7 millones de tCO2e, como\nestaba previsto de conjunto en esos dos proyectos.\n3.2.2 Proyectos planificados como NAMAS\nDentro de los proyectos de mitigación se identificó una Acción de\nMitigación Nacionalmente Apropiada (NAMA, por sus siglas en inglés) que se tituló Reducción de gases de efecto invernadero en la producción porcina cubana, que fue inscrita en el registro de la CMNUCC\npara la solicitud de apoyo para su preparación (NAMA Seeking\nSupport for Preparation. Figura 3.1).28\n27 Se trabaja actualmente con el Banco Centroamericano de Integración Económica para\nrealización de inversión para cierre definitivo y seguro del vertedero de calle 100.\n28 Más información en el sitio: https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/PublicNAMA/_layouts/un/\nfccc/nama/NamaSeekingSupportForPreparation.aspx?ID=178&viewOnly=1\n\n155\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 3.1 Referencia de la NAMA del sector porcino cubano en el registro de la\nCMNUCC.\nSobre la base de esta idea de proyecto el país comunicó en su primera CND la contribución de mitigación referida al aprovechamiento de los residuos orgánicos para la producción de biogás y\nla obtención de bioabonos que remplazan fertilizantes químicos,\ncoadyuvando a la reducción de las emisiones y a la disminución de\nla contaminación de cuencas hidrográficas y bahías. Esta idea se ha\ncontinuado desarrollando y en estos momentos se trabaja con el\napoyo de FAO y el Banco Centroamericano de Integración Económica (BCIE) para presentarla al Fondo Verde del Clima (FVC) para\nsu apoyo financiero.\n3.2.3 Otras acciones de mitigación\nA partir del trabajo colectivo realizado durante la identificación de\nacciones de mitigación para la identificación de las contribuciones\ndel país en su CND, se ha continuado trabajando en la identificación y formulación de un grupo de acciones de mitigación.

De mantenerse el ritmo de reforestación del periodo 2010-2018\n(8315 ha/a), la reforestación del área total susceptible de ser cubierta por\nbosques, concluiría en el año 2055. Si se logra duplicar el ritmo de reforestación promedio del periodo 2010-2018 se podría lograr completar en\n19 años (2037) la cobertura boscosa del área forestal nacional. Esta opción\npermitiría aumentar en 165,000 ha el área cubierta de bosques artificiales establecidos entre 2019 y 2030, removiendo 169.9 millones de tCO2\natmosférico en ese periodo. Esta acción está siendo evaluada técnicamente como una de las opciones que puede incrementar la ambición de la\nPrimera CND del país al 2030. Para lograr esta meta se requiere apoyo\nfinanciero por encima del esfuerzo que el país continuará realizando en\nesta dirección.\n\n161\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 3.7 Acción de mitigación: Reducción de emisiones de GEI en\nel sector porcino en Cuba\n1.1.1.6.

Se prevé un período inversionista de 10 años (depende del financiamiento y la tecnología disponible). Una vez concluida la implementación de las actividades inversionistas, el promedio anual estimado de reducción de emisiones será de 538.1\nktCO2eq./ año. La cantidad total prevista de reducción de emisiones en 15\naños asciende a 6.4 millones de tCO2eq. Además, la implementación del\nproyecto contribuirá sustantivamente a la disminución de vertimientos y\nasí como una menor contaminación a las cuencas hidrográficas, mejorando\nlas condiciones ambientales locales al disminuir los malos olores y la presencia de vectores, así como una reducción de metano en términos globales.\nEn lo económico, los productores podrán disminuir sus gastos por consumo energético, pudiendo tener ingresos adicionales por venta de energía y de otro subproducto como el bioabono. En lo social, mejorará las\ncondiciones de trabajo y de vida de los productores, principalmente de\nlas mujeres, al mejorar las condiciones de cocción de los alimentos y de\ntrabajo. Se incrementará la cantidad de puestos de trabajo con una mejor\ncalidad de vida.\nResultados\nobtenidos\nDesde el 2013 se trabaja en la búsqueda de financiamiento para la formulación del programa.

Método de referencia para la estimación de las\nemisiones GEI para la categoría 1.A. Quema de combustibles\nPara el año 2016 se realizó la estimación de emisiones de CO2 por\nquema de combustibles usando el método de referencia según\nlas buenas prácticas recomendadas en las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006. El método de referencia es un método de arriba hacia abajo (top-down) que utiliza los datos de estadísticas de energía del\npaís para calcular las emisiones de CO2 procedentes de la quema\nde combustibles fósiles principalmente, y permite obtener una segunda estimación independiente de las emisiones de CO2 procedentes de la quema de combustible real en los diferentes sectores,\ncon una exigencia limitada en cuanto al esfuerzo adicional y a los\nrequisitos de datos. Se lo puede considerar una verificación cruzada y forma parte del proceso de control de calidad y exhaustividad\nnecesario para el sector energético (IPCC, 2006).\nEl Método de referencia se basa en la hipótesis de que se conserva el carbono de modo que, por ejemplo, el carbono del petróleo\ncrudo es igual al contenido total de carbono de todos los productos derivados, además no establece ninguna distinción entre las\ndiferentes categorías de fuente del sector de energía y solo estima\nel total de emisiones de CO2 de la categoría de fuente 1.A Quema\nde combustibles. Las emisiones son el resultado de la combustión\nen el sector de energía, en el que se usa el combustible como fuente de calor para refinar o producir energía, y de la combustión en\nel consumo final del combustible o de sus productos secundarios\npor las restantes subcategorías y componentes del sector.\nMetodología\nFue utilizada la ecuación expuesta en las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nEcuación 2.2.

It is within\nthis context that on behalf of the Government of The Republic of GuineaBissau I wish to present the Country’s Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update\nReport to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nThe report covers insightful data and information as well as an analysis on\nfinancial, technical and capacity building support received versus the\nidentified constraints and gaps, financial, technical and capacity-building needs. As a signatory to the UNFCCC,\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau has already been implementing domestic policies and actions to tackle climate\nchange. The PRSP II proposal TERRA RANKA Strategic Document 2015-2025 takes a firm stance regarding climate\nchange by advocating low carbon and climate-resilient development strategies to promote sustainable\ndevelopment. Guinea-Bissau reaffirms its commitment under the INDCs to reducing our greenhouse gas\nemissions through the expansion of national protected areas and a moratorium to ban the felling and export of\ntimber.\n\nThe findings of this Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change although preliminary, they reveal also an ecstatic landmark that the country has achieved by\nexpanding the size of protected areas from 15% to 26.34% (2017) of the country’s territory becoming a sanctuary\nfor the preservation of biodiversity and contributing towards emission reductions and sustainable development.\nHowever, this BUR has likewise exposed the priority areas in need of adaptation as well as the current gaps for an\neffective mitigation. It is clear that amongst other measures the country needs to put a strong emphasis on\nstrengthening human capacities that have a direct effect on improving decision making and planning for integral\nmanagement of low carbon development, by focusing on the necessary techniques and technologies -\nreforestation and conservation of forests and power generation systems from renewable energy (hydroelectric,\nphotovoltaic, wind).\n\nTherefore, Guinea-Bissau believes that with support of the International Community the attainment of these\nactions will contribute towards a greener economic growth trajectory for the country and simultaneously heighten\nthe county’s environmental safeguard for years ahead for the benefit of the people of Guinea-Bissau.\n\nHon. Quite Djata\nSecretary of State of Environment and Biodiversity\n\n i| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Acknowledgements\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau first and foremost, special\nthanks goes to the Global Environment Facility and the United Nations\nEnvironment for the financial support in the preparation and publication of\nthe of this Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update Report (BUR1) to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change of the Republic of\nGuinea-Bissau.\n\nThe development of this Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update Report to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was carried out\nunder the guidance and leadership of the Secretariat of State of Environment\nand Biodiversity - Directorate General of Environment to meet GuineaBissau’s obligation to prepare and submit Biennial Update Report to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Introduction\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a non-Annex-I Party and a signatory to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol and as laid down in Art. 2, Paragraph 1\nof the Kyoto Protocol, is committed to engage and seek to achieve quantified emission limitations\nand reduction of GHG emissions in order to promote sustainable development, minimizing the\nsocial, environmental and economic impacts of anthropogenic activities that contribute to\nemissions of greenhouse gases and thus to global warming. In order to meet its reporting\nobligations, Guinea-Bissau has already prepared and submitted systematically: i) The First\nInventory and the Initial National Communication in 1996, the reference year 1994; ii) The Second\nInventory and subsequent Second National Communication in 2011, the base year 2000, the Third\nInventory and now the First Biennial Update Report and consequently, within this framework, the\nreporting guidelines, adopted during COP 8 for the preparation of National Communications\nfrom Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention and contained in decision 17/CP.8 have\nbeen adopted for the preparation of this Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update Report to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, In 2015 the country has been submitted the\nINDC serving as the basis for the Paris Agreement.\n\n6| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\n1.2 National Circumstances\nGuinea-Bissau, located in Western Africa (12° 00' N,\n15° 00' W), between Cape Roxo (latitude 12º 20' N),\nthe Cajete Ponta (latitude 10° 59' N) and the\nmeridians 13° 38' and 16° 43' W bordering the North\nAtlantic Ocean, with a surface area of 36,125 km2. It\nis bordered to the North with the Republic of\nSenegal and to the East and South with the Republic\nof Guinea and is bathed by the Atlantic Ocean to\nthe West. The country comprises a continental and\nan insular part ― the Bijagós archipelago,\nconsisting of 88 Islands and Islets of which only 21\nare inhabited. In addition to these islands, there are\nalso other islands separated from the continent only\nby narrow rias, such as Bolama, Komo, Melo, Peicixe\nand Geta. Guinea-Bissau is a country with a\nconsiderable natural capital. It has important water\n\nresources translated into 130 km3/year of surface\nwater and 445 km3/year of groundwater, a vast and\nrich maritime territory (54,000 km2 in 270 km of\ncoast), a biodiversity of a considerable level in West\nAfrica. Almost 10% of its territory is covered with\nMangal, perhaps the most important proportion of\nthe world. Currently approximately 26% of its land\nand sea territory is a sanctuary for the preservation\nof biodiversity. The Bijagós archipelago, an\nexceptional natural site with approximately 88\nislands and islanders, is a candidate for the\nUNESCO's\nMan\nand\nthe\nBiosphere\n(MAB)\nProgramme. Several other national localities (ponds\nof Cufada Natural Park, Wendus and other areas)\nare classified as RAMSAR sites (wetlands of\nInternational Importance).\n\nThe Bijagós archipelago, Poilão Island, home to one of the largest populations of nesting green turtles in the world.

Temperature\nprojection scenarios systematically signal increased\naverage daily temperatures of up to + 1.4°C for the\nperiod 2016-2045, potentially reaching up to +\n2.2°C in the 2046-2075 period, per a low emissions\nassumption. Under a high emission scenario, the\nchanges are in the order of + 1.6°C to + 3.1°C for\nthe period 2046 to 2075.\nThe monthly precipitation values (%) during the\nmonths of June, July, August and September of the\nmost recent time series (1981-2017) indicate that in\ngeneral there is a tendency for the values of\nmonthly precipitation to reduce (~10%) with great\ninterannual variability. Guinea-Bissau rainfall series\nindicates (Figure 1.2) that there have been three\nmain trends between 1950 and 2017: prevalence of\nwet years between 1950 and 1970: prevalence of dry\nyears between 1970 and 1990: and from 1990\nonwards: marked shifts between wet and dry year\n\n7| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\n1.2.2 Socio-Economy\nBetween 2005 and 2017, GuineaBissau’s HDI value\nincreased from 0.396 to 0.455, an increase of 15.0\npercent (Table 1.2). Guinea-Bissau’s life expectancy\nat birth increased by 8.7 years, mean years of\nschooling increased by 0.7 years and expected\nyears of schooling increased by 6.8 years (UNDP,\n2018). The vulnerability of the economy is twofold.\nIn one hand, the high dependence on agriculture\n(almost 60% of GDP) in particular, the cashew\nindustry alone, the main source of export revenue\nand a significant share of government revenue. On\nthe other hand, the long period of political\ninstability.\n\n1.2.4 Agriculture and Livestock\nThe agricultural sector is the backbone of GuineaBissau economy, a source of income for 85% of the\npopulation. Agriculture plays an important role in\nthe country's external accounts, and therefore has\na significant impact on macro-economic stability of\nGuinea-Bissau. Agricultural exports account for\nover 98% of total exports of goods. Production and\nexport of cashew nuts and rice cropping are the\nmajor activities coupled with extensive livestock. In\n2012, the area under cashew cultivation was 223\n000 ha with an annual production of 130 000 tons\nof raw cashew nuts (FAO, 2015)i.\n\n1.2.5 Energy and Water Resources\nEnergy consumption in Guinea-Bissau is mainly\nbased on biomass (90%), oil products (8%) and\nelectricity\n(2%).\nBiomass\nenergy\nresources\nencompasses wood, coal and agricultural / forest\nproducts. At the level of subsistence communities,\nthe collection and use of wood / coal for heating\nand cooking uses enormous resources in biomass\nand hand labour. The country’s water resource\nconsists\nof\nsurface\nwater,\nrainwater,\nand\ngroundwater. From the three categories of water\nresources the following quantities are estimated\n(DGRH, 2016): Surface water resources: 13,820\nmillion m3 (estimated); Rainwater resources: 45\nmillion m3; Groundwater resources: 1 756 million\nm3 of statistical reserves (estimated). These\nresources have an estimated renewable annual rate\nof 180 million m3. The surface water includes major\nrivers and its tributaries (the main ones being from\nNorth to South, Cacheu, the Mansoa, the Geba, the\nCorubal, the Catio, the Rio Grande de Buba, the\nCumbijã and Cacine) and estuaries\n1.2.6 Coastal Zone and Biodiversity\nBijagós Archipelago is one of the Guinea-Bissau’s\nprotected areas made of a collection of 88 islands\nthat guard the country’s capital Bissau. A UNESCO\nMan and Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO,2017). the\narchipelago contains both national protected areas\n(Orango, João Vieira-Poilão) and community\nreserves (Urok)ii all haven for hundreds of species of\nbirds, fish, and mammals. Poilão is amongst the 10\nmost important nesting sites for green turtle\npopulation (Figure 1.3) making one of the greatest\nbiodiversity values of Guinea-Bissau.\n\n1.2.7 Forests and Land Use\nGuinea-Bissau continues to have huge agricultural\nand forestry potential, including arable land\nestimated at about 1.5 million hectares, of which\n80% is on plateaus, 200,000 in freshwater valleys,\n106,000 in salt water valleys and more than 100,000\nsquare metres of areas with industrial wood\n(macauhub.com. 2018) The savannas dominate the\nland cover, accounting for about 45 percent of the\ncountry’s land surface in Guinea-Bissau. More than\n70 percent of the country is forested —more than\n45 percent of which is primary forest. The South of\nthe country consists essentially of clump forests\nwith some of the country's best-preserved forest\npatches, probably housing the most dense northern\nforest area in West Africa. The human pressure in\nsearch of spaces for agriculture, construction and\ncommercial purposes, and of woody material\n(firewood, coal) for the production of energy, etc.,\nhave led in particular to the degradation of the\nclump forests of the southern zone. Deforestation,\nthat is, the use of forest resources for other\npurposes, is responsible for issuing a large amount\nof CO2 by the atmosphere. The estimates point to\na decrease in the order of 625,000 m3 per year,\nfrom the forest surface of the country (The National\nStrategic document – Terra Ranka (2015-2025)), i.e.:\n― Reduction of 30% of the dense humid forests\nof Tombali;\n― Reduction of 57% of the savannah forests of\nBafatá, Oio and Gabú;\n― Reduction of 19% of Mangrove forests.\n\n1.2.8 Biodiversity and The National Protected\nAreas\nCompared to the neighbouring countries in the\nWest Africa the biodiversity of Guinea-Bissau is still\nrelatively rich, diversified and unique. This can be\n\n8| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\nseen from the data below of species count by taxa\nfor Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAnimal / plant group\nSpecies count\nBirds\n456\nAmphibians\n21\nReptiles\n69\nFishes\n677\nMammals\n123\nVascular plants\n1000\nSource: Amphibians - amphibiaweb; Reptiles - reptile-database;\nFish - fishbase; Birds - birdlife; Mammals - IUCN; and Plants -\nWorld Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP-WCMC).\n\nThere are however several factors of pressure on\nbiodiversity mostly originated by human activities.\nAmong others the (i) effects of extensive livestock\npracticed in the country, mainly in the east and\nnortheast zones, (ii) forest fires sometimes\nuncontrolled, which have negative impact on the\nfauna and floristic composition; (iii) the pressure of\nthe exponential growth of population with rapid\nurbanisation with corresponding needs, including\nthat of woody fuel (firewood and coal), (iv) the\npractice of the traditional agriculture based on slash\nand burn; the wild expansion of cashew orchards;\nthe growing production and firewood search and\nvegetable coal for domestic use as source of energy\n(v) wood exploitation leading to a frightening\ndegradation of the forest potential taking place\nparticularly in the east frontier zones, namely\nPirada, Canquelifá, Pitche and surroundings,\naccentuating climate change impacts (GoGB, 2015).\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau (GoGB) aware of\nthe current challenges of this sector has put forward\nan Action Plan for the Strategy for the Biodiversity\nof Guinea-Bissau with the objective to identify solid\nmeasures to accomplish its goals.\n\nA ploughshare tortoise listed as endangered. | Credit: Beth\nDevler/Getty\nThe creation of the Protected Areas for the\nconservation\nand\nmanagement\nof\nnatural\nresources, is one of the greatest achievements of\nthe country. The National System of Protected\nAreas of Guinea-Bissau corresponds to seven\nprotected areas (SEA. 2019): Parque Natural das\nLagoas da Cufada (PNLC), Parque Nacional de\nCantanhez (PNC), Complexo Dulombi, Boé e\nTchetche (DBT), Parque Nacional das Ilhas de\nOrango (PNO), Parque Natural dos Tarrafes de\nCacheu (PNTC), terrestrial part of Parque Nacional\nMarinho João Vieira e Poilão (PNMJVP) and Área\nMarinha Protegida Comunitária das Ilhas de Urok\n(AMPCIU). The national protected areas system\nnow covers 26.3% of the national territory, with an\nextension of approximately 750,000ha representing\n12.4% of marine protected areas and 13.9% of\nterrestrial protected areas, which is by and large\ncompliant with the Aichi Targets of the Convention\non Biological Diversity (CBD).\n\n1.3 National Greenhouse Gas\nInventory\nThe inventory carried out from 1978 to 1985 showed\nthat the forest space had decreased about 31,500\nha in this period being Afzelia africana, Khaya\nsenegalensis and Pterocarpus erinaceus the three\nspecies most sought. However more recent data\nindicate an alarming scenario on forest degradation\nin the country. Deforestation measured as tree\ncover loss assessed from 2001 to 2018 for different\n\"tree cover threshold\" used for defining the tree\ncover area from dense forests (≥75% close\ncanopies) to open forests (≥10% sparse canopies)\nindicate systematic losses across all threshold\nvalues. Forest degradation in open canopies are\nextremely high with more than 230,000 ha lost in\nthe open forests of Guinea-Bissau. Yearly average\nlosses varied from 6064 ha during the 2001-2010\nperiod to 21,176 ha between 2011 and 2018. Forest\ndegradation gradually decreases with increasing\ncover threshold (≥75% close canopies) reaching\n1,213 ha of tree cover within the 18 years period. The\nresults from these emissions calculations indicate\nthat the bulk of GHG emissions in the energy Sector,\nin the referential year of 2010, was concentrated in\nthe residential subsector and represented by\ncarbon dioxide emissions (94%). These results also\nsuggest a high consumption of firewood and\ncharcoal in households both in urban centres and\nin rural areas. Emissions are attributable to the\n\n9| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\ncombustion of fossil fuels, but also to the burning\nof plant biomass, i.e. firewood and charcoal. The\nAgriculture and Livestock subsector show positive\nemissions of methane (CH4) which contributed with\na total of 102.7 Gg CO2 equivalent in two\nsubcategories of Enteric fermentation and Manure\nManagement and 9.6. Gg CO2 equivalent for\nburning of biomass subcategory. This represented\na total of 112,3 Gg CO2.\nNotwithstanding the above expected rises in\nGHG emission, the Land Use, Land-Use Change\nand Forestry (LULUCF) is still the highest single\nsector acting as a net sink of GHG amounting to 10718 Gg for the year 2010. Therefore, GuineaBissau is and will remain as an absolute sink of\ngreenhouse gases, given the high potential for\nsequestration by the Forestry sub-sector and the\nFramework Law on sustainable development\npromoting the expansion of the national Protected\nAreas as well as the implementation of the country's\nbiodiversity protection policy.\n\n1.4 Mitigation Actions\nGuinea-Bissau's main national bodies relevant to\nthe climate change mitigation legal framework are:\n1. The National Authority designated for the Kyoto\nMechanisms (DNA that deals with the approval and\nmonitoring of the implementation of projects under\nthe Clean development Mechanism and REDD\nframework.\n2. The National Committee on Climate Change\n(NCCC) supervised by The Secretariat of State of\nEnvironment and Biodiversity (SEAB) consists of an\nadvisory board, a Scientific Council and a technical\ncommittee.\nThe Guinea-Bissau’s emission pattern is such that\nLand Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)\nis still the highest single sector acting as a net sink\nof GHG in 2010. By contrast, GHG emissions from oil\nproducts and transport are significant in the Energy\nSector and so does the GHG emissions from land\ncultivation and livestock in the Agriculture and\nLivestock sectors. Deforestation is also responsible\nfor the release of large amounts of CO2 by\nloosening up carbon stored in forest soils,\nincreasing the chances it will return to the\natmosphere as carbon dioxide and by reducing the\ncarbon sequestration capacity of the country.\nThe\nGuinea-Bissau\nmitigation\nstrategy\nencompasses the implementation of unconditional\nactions and policies complemented by other\nconditional measures supported mainly by bilateral\nor international funding. Since the mitigation\nactions available, such as natural regeneration,\nshort-spin forestry and bioenergy for replacing\nfossil fuels, are not currently practicable mitigation\noptions, the Government of Guinea-Bissau has\ncapitalized efforts to Mitigation in the action of\nforest protection mitigation with a focus on the\nestablishment and effective management of\nprotected areas (APs). Additionally, with the\nimplementation of the LEAP SCREENING program\nbased on the above-mentioned scenarios, the\nfollowing GHG mitigation options have been\nselected in the energy sector:\n• The mitigation scenario by replacing traditional\nstoves of three stones or charcoal stoves, for gas\nstoves. In this option the country would avoid the\nissuance of 163,038 TE CO2 at a sale price of $5.2/\nton of carbon; The mitigation scenario, through the\nconstruction of the dams of Saltinho and Cussilintra\n(the country would divert the emission of 1,130,338\nTE CO2 at a sale price of $7.78/ ton of carbon);\n• The scenario of mitigating the decentralisation of\nrural electrification by using a photovoltaic system\n(the country could protect itself against the\nemission of 47,312 TE CO2 at a sale price of US\n$6.24/ ton of carbon);\nThe mitigation scenario that encompasses the\ninterconnection\nof\nthe\nelectricity\ngrid\nand\nSambagalou and Kaleta (the country would avoid\nthe issuance of 645,170 TE CO2 to $126.72/ ton of\ncarbon sales price).\nThe mitigation scenario based on the development\nand establishment of a legal framework through a\nnational strategy for the development of low\ncarbon in the long term.\n\n1.5 Financial, Technology, Capacity\nNeeds and Support Received for\nClimate Change Activities\nIn the current economic, social and environmental\nsituation of the country, identifying constraints and\nthe financial, technical gaps, and capacity-building\nneeds required for the preparation of BUR 1 is a\nchallenging exercise. However, some country needs\nfor financial, technical and technological support\nand capacity building were identified in order to be\nable to address gaps in handling climate change\nissues. Thus, financial support is required for:\n• Strengthen the financial capacity of the state and\nof the research institutions to collect, archive and\n\n10| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\nanalyse climate data and renewable natural\nresources;\n• Allocate financial resources for the purchase and\nacquisition of certain data and software essential for\nvulnerability\nassessment\nand\nformulation\nof\nadaptation strategy;\n• Provide the country with financial resources to\nbuild capacity and set up a regular vulnerability\nassessment system and climate change adaptation\nand mitigation programs and strategies, among\nothers. According to the Guinea-Bissau Sustainable\nEnergy Investment Plan 2015-2030, approximately\n€680,458,000 would be required in the Energy\nsector, of which €630,000,000 would be invested in\nrenewable\nenergy;\n€3,103,000\nin\nBioenergy;\n€36,000,000 in Energy Efficiency and €11,355,000 in\nFavourable\nEnvironment\n(Institutional\nand\nregulatory capacity building).\nAlternatively, the country should strengthen its\ncapacity at national and local levels to plan and\nimplement measures to increase the resilience of its\ncommunities, equipment and ecosystems to\nclimate change. At local level, communities should\nidentify and prioritize measures and undertake\nprograms and projects that incorporate capital\ngains into their livelihoods; activities that reduce\ntheir vulnerability, in particular as regards climate\nchange and climate variability.\n\n1.6 Information on domestic MRV of\nDomestically supported NAMAs\nReporting and verification are important for\nensuring\ntransparency,\ngood\ngovernance,\naccountability, and credibility of results, and for\nbuilding confidence that resources are being\nutilized effectively. The National Objective is to set\nup a Measurement, Reporting, and Verification\n(MRV)\nsystem\nintegrated\ninto\nthe\ncurrent\nMonitoring and Evaluation (M&E) process at\nnational, sectoral and probably district level\nwhenever possible.\n\nThe National Appropriate Mitigation Actions\n(NAMAs) concept is still in the evolution phase and\ncan be implemented differently depending on the\ntype of support expected by developing countries.\nNAMAs promise to become a primary mechanism\nfor\nachieving\n\"common\nbut\ndifferentiated\nresponsibilities\" in the fight against climate change.\nGuinea Bissau has developed legal and institutional\narrangements for the implementation of NAMAS.\nThe National Designated Authority for Kyoto\nMechanisms (AND-GB) was established by Decree\nNo. 11/2006 of the Council of Ministers. Since then\nseveral initiatives were undertaken not exactly as\nNAMAs but in the context of Low Emissions and\nDevelopment Strategies - LEDS initiatives.\nLow Emissions and Development Strategies - LEDS\ninitiatives provides a direct link between mitigation\nand achieving sustainable development, while\nclimate change is a cross-cutting issue across all the\nsustainable development goals (SDGs) particularly\nthe SDG 13 (climate action). , Guinea Bissau has\nreceived a number of international aid over time,\nsome of which are of assistance to the sectors\ninvolved in fight against the impacts of climate\nchange.\n\n1.7 Additional Information\nThe PRSP II proposal TERRA RANKA Strategic\nDocument 2015-2025 takes a firm stance with\nregard\nto\nclimate\nchange\nby\npromoting\nDevelopment strategies for different growth sectors\nshould become low carbon and climate-resilient\ndevelopment strategies to promote sustainable\ndevelopment. In this context the Biodiversity and\nNatural Capital axis aims to preserve and value the\ncountry's natural resources in a sustainable way.\nMitigation measures are contemplated by the\nproposed increase in the percentage of protected\nareas from 15 to 26%, according to the National\nProtected Areas Strategy enhancing the capacity of\ncarbon sinks; and the programmed investments for\nthe power system to increase its installed capacity\nby 60%. Furthermore, Guinea-Bissau is currently\nseeking funding to draw up its NAMA Strategy and\nREDD + Strategy.\nIn terms of adaptation to climate change impacts\nthe National Strategic Plan prioritises the sectors\nwith the highest exposure: agriculture with 57%,\nfollowed by livestock and health both with 54%, and\nthe fisheries with 51% and infrastructure with 46%.\nIt also focusses on most vulnerable groups (54%),\nfollowed by livestock farmers (49%), waged workers\nliving in large cities (46%) and fishermen (34%).\n\n 11 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nhttps://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/144000/144858/iss058e010724 lrg.jpg\n\n 12 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nChapter 1:\nNational Circumstances\n\nChapter 1\nNational Circumstances\n\n1.1 Introduction .......................................................................................... 13\n1.2 Geography and Climate profile .................................................................. 14\n1.3 Population, Economic and Social Development ............................................... 16\n1.4 Sectoral Development .............................................................................. 17\n1.5 Water Resources, Land Use and Forest ........................................................... 19\n1.6 Key development policies relevant to climate change ....................................... 23\n1.7 References and Footnotes ......................................................................... 27\n\n 13 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nChapter 1:\nNational Circumstances\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nGuinea-Bissau, located in Western Africa (12° 00' N, 15° 00' W), between Cape Roxo (latitude 12º 20' N),\nthe Cajete Ponta (latitude 10° 59' N) and the meridians 13° 38' and 16° 43' W bordering the North Atlantic\nOcean, with a surface area of 36,125 km2. It is bordered to the North with the Republic of Senegal and to\nthe East and South with the Republic of Guinea and is bathed by the Atlantic Ocean to the West. The\ncountry comprises a continental and an insular part ― the Bijagós archipelago, consisting of 88 Islands\nand Islets of which only 21 are inhabited. In addition to these islands, there are also other islands separated\nfrom the continent only by narrow rias, such as Bolama, Komo, Melo, Peicixe and Geta. (Figure 1.1)\nTeak tree (Tectona Grandis) – Bissau – Guinea Bissau\nPhoto credit: T C Ferreira, 2015\n\n 14 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nFigure 1.1 - Geographic Location of Guinea-Bissau\nincluding the Bijagós archipelago\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a country with a considerable\nnatural capital. It has important water resources\ntranslated into 130 km3/year of surface water and\n445 km3/year of groundwater, a vast and rich\nmaritime territory (54,000 km2 in 270 km of coast),\nand a considerable biodiversity at level of West\nAfrica.\nAlmost 10% of its territory is covered with Mangal,\nperhaps the most important proportion of the\nworld. Currently approximately 26% of its land and\nsea territory is a sanctuary for the preservation of\nbiodiversity.\nThe\nBijagós\narchipelago,\nan\nexceptional natural site with approximately 88\nislands and islanders, is a candidate for the\nUNESCO's\nMan\nand\nthe\nBiosphere\n(MAB)\nProgramme. Several other national localities (ponds\nof Cufada Natural Park, Wendus and other areas)\nare classified as RAMSAR sites (wetlands of\nInternational Importance).\n\nThis Chapter presents the national circumstances of\nGuinea-Bissau, also includes information on\nfeatures of its geography, demography, climate and\neconomy as well as key features of the main\neconomic sectors (Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry,\nWater Resources, Public Health, Energy and Waste)\nto provide a sense of the overall national context in\nwhich climate change mitigation and adaptation\nchallenges are being dealt with.\n1.2 Geography and Climate profile\nThe climate of Guinea-Bissau is predominantly determined by factors such as the influence of the\ngeographic location of Guinea-Bissau, the anticyclone of the Azores, the neighboring Sahelian climatic\nzone; the trade winds; the \"Harmattan\"; the action of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated\nwith the African summer monsoon; the action of the oceanic currents, namely the continuity with the High\nAtlas chain of the Canary Islands (current of the North + current of Morocco + current of the Azores) and\nthe influence of the cold current during the northern winter that diverges to NW in the Atlantic region\nneighboring Guinea Bissau and lastly, the influence of the warm Contra-current (guinea current) during\nthe northern summer.\n\n1.2.1 Rainfall\nGuinea-Bissau has two very pronounced seasons:\nthe hot and rainy season, which lasts from May to\nNovember, and the hot and dry season from\nNovember to April. On average, about 80% of\nannual rainfall occurs during the months of July,\nAugust and September Precipitations during\nmonsoon stations can be intense, with more than\n500 mm/month recorded in August, which\nrepresents\nthe\nmedian\nof\na\nquasi-normal\ndistribution with values close to 400 mm/month in\nJuly and September. The smallest amount, close to\nzero (0.1 mm), occurs during the months of\nDecember to April (dry season). The climate in\ngeneral is tropical maritime with an average\ntemperature of 27 º C and Monsoon conditions\n(May to November) and the Winds \"Harmattan\"\n(hot dry air, and laden with dust from the Sahara)\nduring the dry season (November to April). These\nclimatic\ncharacteristics\ninduce\nvariations\nin\nprecipitation in relation to the geographic location\nof the country (South: > 1800 mm/year; West: 15501800 mm/year; Northwest: 1300-1550 mm/year;\nNorth-northeast: ≤ 1300 mm/year) and Southeast:\n1300-1550 mm/year.\n\n1.2.2 Temperature\nUnlike precipitation the temperature in GuineaBissau is subject to minor variations although the\naverage monthly temperature varies regularly\nthroughout the year, with maximum values\n\n 15 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nbetween April (28.5 º C) and May (28.7 º C) and\nminimum values between December and January\n(25.4 º C). Interestingly, unlike the past situation, the\nmonthly thermal amplitude is now considerably\nreduced during the particular rainy months\nbetween July and September when the minimum\ntemperature reaches 23 º C and maximum\ntemperature reaches minimum annual values (30.4\nº C-29.8 º C) in July and August respectively with\naverage monthly temperature varying between 24\nº C and 30 º C. Over a year, the daily temperature\ntypically varies from 18 º C to 35 ºC and is rarely less\nthan 17 º C or above 37 ºC. Spatially, the average\n(1981-2017) monthly values of the air temperature\nrange from 29.7 ºC to 39.4 ºC (maximum) and from\n16.3 ºC to 23.8 ºC (minimum) among the main\nregions of North, South and East central regions.\nSpatially and in terms of homogeneity the thermal\nregime divides the country by means in two distinct\nzones with average temperature values above 27.5\nº C to the east towards the interior in the Bafatá\nzone and below this value to the West and south\ntowards the coast in the area of Bissau and Bolama.\n\nTemperature series (1950-2001) indicate that there\nhas been an increase in the average temperature\nvalues at a rate of 0.0155 °c/year in the last 50 years,\nleading to an approximate average rate of variation\n(°c/century) of 1.55 °c. Thus, this temperature\nbehaviour\nreflects\nthe\nregional\npattern\nof\ntemperature variation in recent decades, which\nindicates that temperatures are increasing faster\nthan the global average. This increase ranged\nbetween 0.2 and 0.8 ° C since the end of the decade\nof 1970.\n\n1.2.3 Climate variability in Guinea-Bissau\nThroughout the year, the climate of Guinea-Bissau\nis mainly conditioned by the situation, movements\nand impacts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone\n(ZCIT or ITCZ of the English acronym) in relation to\nthe territory and the subsidiary actions of the semipermanent cells of high Pressure, commonly known\nas anticyclone of the Azores in the North Atlantic\nand anticyclone of Santa Helena in the South\nAtlantic, and also by the low summer thermal that\nsettles on the Sahara Desert. Changes in the\nbehaviour of the general air circulation systems\nsuch as the abnormal oscillation of the ITCZ or the\nincrease of the sea surface temperature (SSTs) that\ntakes place when there is a cool in the northern\ntropical Atlantic, and a little warm up in the South\nAtlantic, the region of the Sahel where Guinea\nBissau tends to become drier with decreased\nprecipitation.\nOn\nthe\nother\nhand,\nhuman\nanthropogenic action by reducing vegetation\ncover, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and\nair pollution in the northern hemisphere has also\nbeen pointed out as being at the origin of climate\nchange in the Sahel region and surrounding area\nsuch as Guinea-Bissau. These changes are\nparticularly notable in the variability of precipitation\nwith delays in early rains, increased extreme events\nof precipitation, reduction of total and the number\nof days of precipitation, appearance of dry periods\nat half of rainfall season, strong winds, increased\ntemperature, increased heat waves, decreased\nthermal amplitude with rise of the minimum\ntemperature and number of warm nights (with\nvalues oscillating in about 10% in some cases).\n\n1.2.4 Temperature variability\nClimate unpredictability will remain an overriding\naspect of climate in Guinea-Bissau. Given that these\nqualms are present in the socio-economic life of the\ncountry, planning for increases in temperature\ntogether with the development of resilient planning\nfor extreme events of drought will be required,\nparticularly in the eastern portion of the country\n(Bafatá), and flood along the coastal zone and\nuncertainty over precipitation levels. Temperature\nprojection scenarios systematically signal increased\naverage daily temperatures of up to + 1.4°C for the\nperiod 2016-2045, potentially reaching up to +\n2.2°C in the 2046-2075 period, per a low emissions\nassumption. Under a high emission scenario, the\nchanges are in the order of + 1.6°C to + 3.1°C for\nthe period 2046 to 2075.\n\n1.2.5 Rainfall variability\nThe monthly precipitation values (%) during the\nmonths of June, July, August and September of the\nmost recent time series (1981-2017) indicate that in\ngeneral there is a tendency for the values of\nmonthly precipitation to reduce (~10%) with great\ninterannual variability. Guinea-Bissau rainfall series\nindicates (Figure 1.2) that there have been three\nmain trends between 1950 and 2017: prevalence of\nwet years then between 1950 and 1970: prevalence\nof dry years between 1970 and 1990: and from 1990\nonwards: marked shifts between wet and dry years.\n\n 16 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nFigure 1.2 - Change in rainfall index (SPI) for Guinea-Bissau between 1950 to 2017 (Data Source: Ferreira, T C & Lona, J\nT. 2018 with data from INM-GB, 2018).\n\n1.3 Population, Economic and Social Development\nGuinea Bissau's population is estimated to climb to 1.92 million in 2019, compared to 1,842 million (est\n2017) and 1,514 million at the 2014 census. The population density of Guinea Bissau increased from 44.21\npeople per square kilometer as of, 2000 to 64,57 in 2016 (Table 1.1). Concentration of urban population is\nalso taking place in other major cities such as Gabú 43,556 (2009) and Bafatá 34,760 (2010). Population of\nurban areas in Guinea-Bissau has been growing at considerable rate and recent data indicate that\nurbanization stands at 4.28% (2010-2016 est.). This means that in general considerable amount of people\nis migrating to urban areas. Urban population (% of total) in Guinea Bissau stand at 43.4 % in 2018 est\n(World Fact Book, 2018). Approximately one-fifth of the population lives in the capital city of Bissau along\nthe Atlantic coast; the remainder is distributed among the eight other, mainly rural, regions. The population\nof Guinea-Bissau is expected to grow in 2019 and reach 2,000,000 by the end of 2020 (populationof.net.\n2019).\n\nTable 1.1 - Guinea-Bissau’s population and demographic trends based on consistent time series data (sources: GNB\nBUR Sectoral Report 2018 with data from INE, 2009; WB, 2016).\n\nIndicator\n2000\n2010\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\nTotal population1\n1.243\n1.555\n1.638\n1.681\n1.725\n1.770\n1.815\n1.842*\nAnnual population growth (%)\n1,82\n2,50\n2,60\n2,61\n2,60\n2,56\n2,52\n-\nAnnual growth urban population (%)\n4,09\n4,46\n4,41\n4,35\n4,27\n4,16\n4,05\n-\nAnnual growth of pop-rural (%)\n0,53\n0,91\n1,02\n1,05\n1,05\n1,03\n1,00\n-\nPopulation density (inhab/km2)\n44,21\n55,33\n58,26\n59,80\n61,37\n62,96\n64,57\n-\nBirth rate (Gross/1000 inhab.)\n41,33\n39,25\n38,58\n38,15\n37,68\n37,15\n-\n-\nMortality rate (Gross/1000 inhab.)\n14,04\n11,99\n11,52\n11,27\n11,03\n10,78\n-\n-\nAverage life expectancy (years)\n52,23\n55,00\n55,76\n56,15\n56,55\n56,95\n-\n-\nInfant mortality rate (/1000 birt.)\n105,20\n72,40\n66,50\n63,90\n61,60\n59,60\n57,80\n-\n\n1 In 2009, the population was 1.520.830, According to the official census (INEC, RGPH, 2009)\n\n 17 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\n1.3.1 Demography\nIn 2015 the population age distribution was such\nthat 39.6% of the population is under 15 years old,\n55.0% between 15 and 60 years old and 5.4% of the\npopulation is 65+. Guinea-Bissau’s young and\ngrowing population is sustained by high fertility;\napproximately 60% of the population is under the\nage of 25. Its large reproductive-age population\nand total fertility rate of more than 4 children per\nwoman offsets the country’s high infant and\nmaternal mortality rates. The latter is among the\nworld’s highest because of the prevalence of early\nchildbearing, a lack of birth spacing, the high\npercentage of births outside of health care facilities,\nand a shortage of medicines and supplies.\nPredominantly, the population of Guinea-Bissau is\nrural based, with about 56.6 percent of GuineaBissau's population living in rural areas and the\nnumber of urban residents being around 743 402.\n\n1.3.2 Socio-Economy\nGuinea-Bissau’s HDI value for 2017 is 0.455— which\nput the country in the low human development\ncategory—positioning it at 177 out of 189 countries\nand\nterritories.\nBetween\n2005\nand\n2017,\nGuineaBissau’s HDI value increased from 0.396 to\n0.455, an increase of 15.0 percent (Table 1.2).\nGuinea-Bissau’s life expectancy at birth increased\nby 8.7 years, mean years of schooling increased by\n0.7 years and expected years of schooling increased\nby 6.8 years (UNDP, 2018).\nStandard of living measured by Gross National\nIncome (GNI) per capita expressed in constant 2011\ninternational dollars converted using purchasing\npower parity (PPP) conversion rates have shown a\nsteady increase from 1,335 in 1990 to 1,552 in 2017\n(UNDP, 2018). However, the GDP per-capita of\nGuinea-Bissau\nas an indicator of country's\neconomic strength, has reached 692.60 US dollars\nin 2011 and went through a mostly stable period\npicking up to 614 in 2010 then reaching 620.21 US\ndollars in 2016 and this represents a GDP per Capita\nequivalent to 3% of the world's average.\nThe vulnerability of the economy is twofold. In one\nhand, the high dependence on agriculture (almost\n60% of GDP) in particular, the cashew industry\nalone, the main source of export revenue and a\nsignificant share of government revenue. On the\nother hand, the long period of political instability.\n\nTable 1.2 -.

Agriculture plays an important role in the country's external accounts, and therefore has a\nsignificant impact on macro-economic stability of Guinea-Bissau. Agricultural exports account for over 98%\nof total exports of goods. Production and export of cashew nuts and rice cropping are the major activities\ncoupled with extensive livestock. In 2012, the area under cashew cultivation was 223 000 ha with an annual\nproduction of 130 000 tons of raw cashew nuts (FAO, 2015)3. In 2013, cashew nuts accounted for 87.7\npercent of the country’s total exports. The industry has been increasing since the late 1990s, and now 85\npercent of people living in rural areas depend on these orchards in some way for their livelihoods4. This\nhas allowed for great economic improvement, yet the lack of biodiversity involved with this monocultural\npractice leaves citizens extremely vulnerable. If crops failed or were struck by disease, hundreds of\nthousands of citizens would be negatively affected.\n\n 18 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nThe country’s climate and soil make it feasible to\ngrow a wide range of cash crops, fruit, vegetables,\nand tubers; however, cashews generate on average\nmore than 80% of export receipts and are the main\nsource of income for many rural communities.\nGuinea-Bissau also exports to Asia non-fillet frozen\nfish and seafood, peanuts, palm kernels, and timber\n(The World Fact Book, 2019). License fees for fishing\nin their sea-zone (Gulf of Guinea) provide the\ngovernment with some revenue. Rice is the major\ncrop and staple food. Commercial cashew nut\ngrowers have 15% of cashew plantations (15 000\nhectares) whilst the remaining 85% (88 000\nhectares) belong to traditional farmers. Rice is\nanother strategic crop in Guinea-Bissau and is the\nstaple food of more than 95 percent of the\npopulation. In 2014, the country produced 133 000\ntonnes of this cereal. However, for over ten years,\nthere has been a growing deficit, which was\nestimated at over 100 000 tons in 2009/2010, with\ndomestic production covering only 47% of\nconsumption. In Guinea-Bissau, the livestock sector\ncontributes 17% to the national GDP and 32% of the\nagrarian sector GDP. According to the livestock\ncensus conducted in 2009 by the Directorate\nGeneral of Livestock (DGP) under the PRESAR / BAD,\nit is estimated that the total number of cattle rounds\n1 325 412, distributed mainly in eastern and northern\nareas5.\n\nN'Dama cattle breed\n\n1.4.2 Fishing\nThe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) runs along 270\nkm of coastline and has 105.740 square kilometres\nfor a continental shelf of 45 000 km². The fisheries\nsector is one of the most important for the country’s\n\n2 Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du fleuve Gambie\neconomy and directly employs around 15 000\npeople or indirectly 120 000 workers. Fishing\ncontributes to about 7-10% to GDP and around\n3.9% in exports contributing with 40% to the state\nbudget (The World Bank, 2018). Fishing in GuineaBissau has a potential estimated at around 523 160\ntons, corresponding to a pelagic potential of\naround 212 500 tons and demersal (bottom\ndwelling) species equal to 310 660 tons. Artisan\nfishery accounts to about 35 000 t (2010). Artisan\nfishery\nhas\nincorporated\nsome\ntechnical\ninnovations, such as certain kinds of nets, new\nrefrigeration techniques and, mostly, motorization\nwith the introduction of outboard motors. This\nfishery is done in a complex, fragile and mobile\nmarine ecosystem (Nahada, et al., 2012).\n\n1.4.3 Energy\nEnergy consumption in Guinea-Bissau is mainly\nbased on biomass (90%), oil products (8%) and\nelectricity\n(2%).\nBiomass\nenergy\nresources\nencompass wood, coal and agricultural / forest\nproducts. At the level of subsistence communities,\nthe collection and use of wood / coal for heating\nand cooking uses enormous resources in biomass\nand hand labour. The hydroelectric potential of\nGuinea Bissau is high, however only 33.84MW of\nhydropower capacity has been identified so far\n(including Saltinho (14MW) and Cusselinta (13MW))\nin studies carried out in the 1980’s. Therefore, in\nGuinea-Bissau the production of electricity is\nexcessively dependent on imported diesel fuel. The\ncountry’s energy strategy pursues to increase\nreliance on local energy sources, by placing more\nemphasis on the utilization of renewable energies\nto gradually lessen the dependency on the\ntraditional\nenergy\nsources,\nespecially\noil\nimportation. Guinea Bissau has only one solar\nphotovoltaic power plant of 314kW to produce\nelectricity (which was expected to start operating in\n2014), and a pilot projects for energy cogeneration\nwith cashew shells, whose energy sources or\nresources are abundant in the country. In addition,\nthere are projects being developed in the context\nof hydroelectric plants, for example, the OMVG2,\n(the\nGambia\nRiver\nBasin\nDevelopment\nOrganization) Saltinho/Cusselinta and Banbadinga.\n\n 19 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\n1.4.4 Coastal Zones and Biodiversity\nGuinea Bissau’s biodiversity constitutes a significant natural asset for the country that, if protected, has the\npotential to serve as the backbone of a future tourism industry. Possessing an incredibly diverse set of ecosystems ranging from dense tropical forests to mangrove swamps, Guinea-Bissau has become increasingly\nmore conscious of the value of its natural wealth, investing substantially in conservation to the extent that\napproximately 26% of its national territory is protected (The World Bank, 2015).\n\nGuinea-Bissau’s Bijagós Archipelago is one of these\nprotected areas made of a collection of 88 islands\nthat guard the country’s capital Bissau. A UNESCO\nMan and Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO, 2017). the\narchipelago contains both national protected areas\n(Orango, João Vieira-Poilão) and community\nreserves (Urok)6 all haven for hundreds of species\nof birds, fish, and mammals. Poilão is amongst the\n10 most important nesting sites for green turtle\npopulation (Figure 1.3) making one of the greatest\nbiodiversity values of Guinea-Bissau. At the same\ntime, the coastal zone also provides valuable\necosystem services now, including nursery and\nbreeding grounds for commercial fish stocks,\ncarbon stocks and a buffer to mitigate against the\nimpacts of climate change. Two additional\nterrestrial national parks (the Dulombi and Boé\nparks) and three environmental corridors (the TcheTche, Salifo, and Cantabane Corridors), which\nconnect areas and permit wildlife movement while\nbuffering human communities, were recentlt\nadded. At present, vegetative cover along the\ncoastline in the identified hotspots has been\ndegraded for several climate and anthropogenicdriven reasons. In Guinea Bissau mangroves are\nexploited to smoke fish and have reduced\nmangrove cover that otherwise function as a\nnatural protective barrier to coastline erosion and\nsustain fishing activity.\nGreen Turtle\nFigure 1.3 - Green turtle in Poilão protected area - GuineaBissau’s Bijagós Archipelago (Seminoff, J.A. 2004)\n\n1.5 Water Resources, Land Use and Forest\n1.5.1 Rivers\nThe country’s water resource consists of surface\nwater, rainwater, and groundwater. From the three\ncategories of water resources the following\nquantities are estimated (DGRH, 2016): Surface\nwater resources: 13,820 million m3 (estimated);\nRainwater resources: 45 million m3; Groundwater\nresources: 1 756 million m3 calculated reserves\n(estimated). These resources have an estimated\nrenewable annual rate of 180 million m3. The\nsurface water includes major rivers and its\ntributaries (the main ones being from North to\nSouth, Cacheu, the Mansoa, the Geba, the Corubal,\nthe Catio, the Rio Grande de Buba, the Cumbijã and\nCacine) and estuaries. In addition, there are\nimportant stationary water bodies including lakes\n(like Cufada pond with an area of 35 000 hectares),\n\nlowlands (bas-fonds) and often temporary water\nbodies (Vendus) a common structure found in the\nEast of the country. Some of the important rivers\nhave a highly seasonal flow and many streams and\nrivers can dry up during the latter part of the\nsummer. The Geba, the Farim and the Corubal\nRivers are the most important in the country, and\nthe first two almost cease to flow in the dry season.\nThe Corubal River has an important dry season flow\n(11 m³/ s on average) becoming the most important\nsurface water resource in the country. The Geba\nRiver contribution is more modest, but with\ndramatic reduction of the flow of some of its\ntributaries during the dry season. Water Resources\nof main water Basins in Guinea-Bissau including the\naverage annual volume is shown in Table 1.3.\n\n 20 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nTable 1.3 - Water Resources of Main Water Basins (DGRH, 2016).\n\nWater Basin\nStation\nSurface\nArea\n(Km2)\nAverage\nAnnual\nVolume\n(Mm3/Ano)\nDry Year Volume\nRecurrence 5 Years (Mm3/Year)\nAnnual Volume\nDecadal\n(Mm3/Year)\nCorubal\nSaltinho\n23 840\n13 200\n8 100\n6 380\nGeba\nBafata\n10 325\n820\n-\n375\nGeba\nGambiel\n590\n58\n-\n-\nCacheu\nJumbembem\n1 722\n96\n-\n34\nCatio\nBalana\n150\n90\n-\n-\n\n1.5.2 Groundwater\nThe renewal of the water resources depends largely on\nthe intensity and regularity of rainfall, whose parameters\nhave been worsening gradually over the years.\nGroundwater and surface water reserves (free aquifers)\nare estimated to be several hundred m³ / year (from 10\nto 250 m³ / year, depending on the zone). However,\nwith high rates exploitation and salinity problems while\nmuch of the river network is actually an estuary with\ntides there is a significant saltwater intrusion extending\n175 km upriver within the territory. This causes\nsignificant saltwater intrusion into the aquifer, which can\ncause problems during the dry season, if the extraction\nexceeds the water filling the aquifer. There is a huge\nwater potential in the regions of Biombo and Cacheu\nOio. However, cases of pollution of aquifers by\nsaltwater, are most common in these regions. Deep\naquifers, though little known in the South, have more\nlimited exploitable renewable resources in the order of\n10 to 30 Mm³ / year. The current exploitation of aquifers\nis estimated at 15 Mm³ / year and only 14% of deep\naquifers are exploited in the region (DGRH, 2012).\n\n1.5.3 Land Use\nGuinea-Bissau continues to have huge agricultural and\nforestry potential, including arable land estimated at\nabout 1.5 million hectares, of which 80% is on plateaus,\n200,000 in freshwater valleys, 106,000 in salt water\nvalleys and more than 100,000 square metres of areas\nwith industrial wood (macauhub.com. 2018)\n The\nsavannas dominate the land cover, accounting for about\n45 percent of the country’s land surface in GuineaBissau. Although the total savanna land surface has\nremained nearly unchanged, the underlying dynamic is\nnot so simple. The rate of deforestation has increased\nfrom about 2 percent per year between 1975 and 2000\nto 3.9 percent over the 2000 to 2013 period. Overall,\nGuinea-Bissau lost about 77 percent of its forests\nbetween 1975 and 2013; only 180 sq km remain, mainly\nin the south near the Guinea border. Likewise,\nwoodlands regresed by 35 percent over the 38 years, a\nloss of 1,750 sq km (eros.usgs.gov. 2013).\n\n1.5.4 Forests\nMore than 70 percent of the country is forested —more\nthan 45 percent of which is primary forest. The south of\nthe country consists essentially of clump forests with\nsome of the country's best-preserved forest patches,\nprobably housing the most dense northern forested\narea in West Africa. The forests of Guinea-Bissau\ncontribute 6% in national GDP and contribute 6.2% in\nthe country's export revenues. While Guinea-Bissau's\nnet deforestation rate has been relatively low at 0.5\npercent per year between 2000 and 2005, there is\nconcern about increasing growth and development,\nespecially in a new era of relative political stability. In\nparticular, coastal mangrove swamps—some of the\nmost important in Africa—are giving way to rice fields\nand hydroelectric projects. Slash-and-burn agriculture,\ncoal production, fires, fuelwood cutting, and logging for\ntimber have resulted in forest loss and subjected\nGuinea-Bissau to serious soil degradation. Actually, new\ndata (Mongabay, 2018) shows that the area of tree cover\n(1,022,708 ha) in 2018 in relation to land area (3,402,910\nha) stands at 30.1% (Mongabay, 2018). Annual loss (ha)\nof primary forest cover and tree cover for Guinea-Bissau\nis rapidily changing as is shown in Table 1.4. The human\npressure in search of spaces for agriculture, construction\nand commercial purposes, and of woody material\n(firewood, coal) for the production of energy, etc., have\nled in particular to the degradation of the clump forests\nof the southern zone.\nTable 1.4 - Annual loss (ha) of primary forest cover and tree\ncover for Guinea-Bissau by year from 2000 to 2018.\nYear\nPrimary forest\nTree cover (30%7)\n2001\n\n2,368\n2002\n137\n6,081\n2003\n14\n1,022\n\n 21 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\n2004\n76\n3,550\n2005\n76\n3,550\n2006\n49\n2,019\n2007\n65\n6,054\n2008\n69\n3,255\n2009\n138\n7,975\n2010\n139\n4,909\n2011\n149\n4,284\n2012\n110\n3,517\n2013\n476\n20,735\n2014\n448\n12,885\n2015\n408\n12,693\n2016\n527\n16,140\n2017\n504\n16,465\n2018\n451\n14,412\nSource:https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Guin\nea-Bissau.htm\n\nDeforestation, that is, the use of forest resources for\nother purposes, is responsible for issuing a large\namount of CO2 by the atmosphere. The estimates point\nto a decrease in the order of 625,000 m3 per year, from\nthe forest surface of the country (The National Strategic\ndocument – Terra Ranka (2015-2025)), i.e.:\n― Reduction of 30% of the dense humid forests of\nTombali;\n― Reduction of 57% of the savannah forests of Bafatá,\nOio and Gabú;\n― Reduction of 19% of Mangrove forests.\nThe forest area of Guinea-Bissu is around 2 072 000 ha\n(CARBOVEG Project, 2007). However, between 60,000\nand 80,000 hectares (Sardinha, 1993) of Guinea-Bissau\nforest are lost every year due to deforestation, illegal\nlogging, uncontrolled forest fires and charcoal\nproduction. The wood is the dominant biomass fuel for\ndomestic consumption, with a demand that probably\nexceeds 500 000 tonnes per year. The vast majority of\nthe population still cooks on firewood and charcoal and\non average, 60 000 hectares (Bianchi et. al., in 1986) of\nland are cleared and/or burned every year in GuineaBissau. The disappearance of the forest and mangroves,\nand the impact on sequestration of the GHGs produced\nthrough fires and smoke form charcoal and wood as\nhousehold energy may probably lead to serious\natmospheric consequences.\n\n1.5.5 Conservation and Management of\nBiodiversity\nCompared to the neighboring countries in the West\nAfrica the biodiversity of Guinea-Bissau is still relatively\nrich, diversified and unique. This can be seen from the\ndata below of species count by taxa for Guinea-Bissau\n(Table 1.5).\n\nTable 1.5 - Species count by taxa for Guinea-Bissau.\nAnimal / plant group\nSpecies count\nBirds\n456\nAmphibians\n21\nReptiles\n69\nFishes\n677\nMammals\n123\nVascular plants\n1000\nSource: Amphibians - amphibiaweb; Reptiles - reptile-database; Fish -\nfishbase; Birds - birdlife; Mammals - IUCN; and Plants - World\nConservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP-WCMC).\n\nNevertheless, the pressure has been increasing on the\nrenewable natural assets, in these most recent years,\ndriven not only by natural factors, but mainly by the\nanthropological activities, which have been increasing\nintensively every year due to market demands and the\nextremely poor people's need for survival. As the flora\nof Guinea-Bissau is very rich, plants are intensively used\nin the traditional pharmacopoeia; this practice is deeply\nrooted among the rural communities of the country.\nThese medicinal plants are essentially for the cure of the\nmost frequent diseases, such as: malaria, diarrhea, skin\ndiseases, hepatitis, hypertension, diabetes, snake bites,\namong others. There are however several factors of\npressure on biodiversity mostly originated by human\nactivities. Among others the (i) effects of extensive\nlivestock practiced in the country, mainly in the east and\nnortheast zones, (ii) forest fires sometimes uncontrolled,\nwhich have negative impact on the fauna and floristic\ncomposition; (iii) the pressure of the exponential growth\nof\npopulation\nwith\nrapid\nurbanisation\nwith\ncorresponding needs, including that of woody fuel\n(firewood and coal), (iv) the practice of the traditional\nagriculture based on slash and burn; the wild expansion\nof cashew orchards; the growing production vegetable\ncoal for domestic use as source of energyl and firewood\nsearch, (v) wood exploitation leading to a frightening\ndegradation of the forest potential taking place\nparticularly in the east frontier zones, namely Pirada,\nCanquelifá, Pitche and surroundings, accentuating\nclimate change impacts (GoGB, 2015). Therefore due to\nall these pressures there are currently several species\nunder threat in Guinea-Bissau (Table 1.6).\n\n 22 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nTable 1.6 - Data on threatened species in Guinea-Bissau as of\n2017.\nTaxa\nSpecies count\nThreatened mammals (2018)\n14\nThreatened birds (2018)\n12\nThreatened fishes (2018)\n41\nThreatened higher plants (2018)\n6\n\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau (GoGB), aware of the\ncurrent challenges of this sector has put forward an\nAction Plan for the Strategy for the Biodiversity of\nGuinea-Bissau with the objective to identify solid\nmeasures to accomplish its goals which include:\n• Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and to\npromote its sustainable use;\n• To address the fundamental causes of the biodiversity\nloss, making sure that concerns about the biodiversity\nare\nintegrated\nand\nare\nappropriate\nfor\nthe\ngovernment and for the society in general;\n• To improve the biodiversity situation, protecting\necosystems, species and genetic diversity;\n• To increase the biodiversity benefits and ecosystem\nservices for all;\n• To increase the implementation of the Action Plan\nthrough participating planning, knowledge and\ntraining management.\nThis action plan includes, not only measures of the\nnational responsibility, but also activities to be\nundertaken by the regions and the local communities\nand by other actors that interact with the biodiversity\nand that benefit from the services rendered by the\necosystems.\n\n1.5.6 The National Protected Areas\nThe creation of the Protected Areas for the conservation\nand management of natural resources, one of the\ngreatest achievements of the country and was expected\nto rise to 24% by 2015 and now set at 26.3% in 2017.\nIndeed the Government of Guinea Bissau has\nestablished new protected areas, including the\nDulombi-Boe-Tchétché complex that consists of two\nnational parks and three ecological corridors. So far, the\ninvestment priorities of the country in the area of\nconservation related to the creation of protected areas\nalong the coastal and island area (the Bijagos\nArchipelago) covering almost 15% of the national\nterritory. In order to protect a more complete and\nrepresentative sample of key habitats, efforts made in\nrecent years consisted in developing the national parks\nof Boé and Dulombi on the country’s mainland, close to\nthe border with Senegal and Guinea. These parks now\noffer protection for a remarkable biodiversity such as\nlions, panthers, chimpanzees or elephants. Comprising\nof a Ramsar site, called Wendu Tcham, that is home to\nmajor waterbird populations, in addition to three (3)\nwildlife corridors, the Boé National Park ensures\nconnectivity between the two parks and with the Lagoas\nde Cufada Natural Park and the Cantanhez National\nPark.\nThe National System of Protected Areas of GuineaBissau corresponds to seven protected areas (SEA.\n2019): Parque Natural das Lagoas da Cufada (PNLC),\nParque Nacional de Cantanhez (PNC), Complexo\nDulombi, Boé e Tchetche (DBT), Parque Nacional das\nIlhas de Orango (PNO), Parque Natural dos Tarrafes de\nCacheu (PNTC), terrestrial part of Parque Nacional\nMarinho João Vieira e Poilão (PNMJVP) and Área\nMarinha Protegida Comunitária das Ilhas de Urok\n(AMPCIU). The national protected areas system now\ncovers 26.3% of the national territory, with an extension\nof approximately 750,000ha representing 12.4% of\nmarine protected areas and 13.9% of terrestrial\nprotected areas, which is by and large compliant with\nthe Aichi Targets of the Convention on Biological\nDiversity (CBD).\nThis set of protected areas (Figure 1.4) and their\nrespective area of influence contain the most relevant\nforest, woodland and mangrove patches of the country\nInstitute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP) has\nbeen working in close collaboration with many partners\nto manage these areas, including the Fondation\nBioGuinée, now at the capitalisation stage, which will\nprovide an essential sustainable funding tool for the\nproper management of protected areas (prcmarine,\n2019).\n\n 23| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nFigure 1.4 - The National System of Protected Areas of Guinea-Bissau with corresponding seven protected areas\n(Source: SEA. 2019).\n\n1.6 Key development policies relevant to climate change\n\n1.6.1 Mitigation Policies\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau has elaborated and implemented a wide range of policies that relate\ndirectly or indirectly to climate change and GHG mitigation.\n\n• The Terra law was approved by the National\nAssembly.\nThis\ninstrument\nregulates\nthe\nmanagement of space in the national territory and,\nin particular, brings discipline and minimizes the\nproblems associated with land concessions for\ndifferent purposes. However, this law recognizes\ntwo fundamental aspects: Forest reserves and the\nrecognition of customary law of community land\nmanagement.\n• Framework Law on Protected Areas (PA), an\ninstrument that aims above all to create a legal\nframework conducive to the conservation of fragile\necosystems in Guinea-Bissau. It also regulates the\nclassification system and the declassification of\nprotected areas at national level.\n• Forestry Law: This law updates the rules and forest\ntaxation and are being applied throughout the\nnational territory. This new forestry law attaches\ngreat importance to aspects of reforestation,\noverexploitation in areas where there are sawmills\nand areas with potential problems of land\ndegradation.\n• Mining and Minerals Law. This Law regulates the\ndifferent forms of exploitation of mineral resources\nin the country. Most minerals in the country are in\nforest areas susceptible to degradation in case of\npoor management. The law can contribute to meet\nthe standards of concern for environmental\nprotection. The holder of the operating license\nmust, under penalty of sanctions, strive to reconcile\nthe work of exploitation with the environment. For\nexample, the operating licenses granted to quarries\nin general will only be issued if they are discovered\nthat do not adversely affect the environment.\n• The National Forest Action Plan contains a\ndetailed analysis of the situation based on which\npolicies are defined, strategies, actions and goals to\nbe achieved, to use durable forestry resources, It\n\n 24| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\nalso\ndefines\nthe\nmeans\nnecessary\nfor\nits\nimplementation in the following main issues:\n- Techniques for the use of forest space by the\npopulation to combat food insecurity;\n- Burning for changing in cultivation and for\nhunting;\n- Extensive livestock and increased transhumance;\n- The use of fire as the main instrument of\n\ndeforestation and renovation of pastures;\n- The process of deforestation to create new\nagricultural land for cash crops (especially cashew\nnuts, peanuts and cotton);\n- Overexploitation of forest species of high\ncommercial value;\n- Increase in hunting sites and illegal hunters;\n- Increase in population density and appearance\nof new Tabancas (small villages) in the wildlife\ncorridors.\n• The National Environmental Management Plan\n(NEMP), the main document and regulator of\nenvironmental\nissues\nin\nGuinea-Bissau.\nThis\ndocument contains the main concerns of other\ndevelopment sectors, not only in terms of\nconservation, but also of development itself. The\nplan, through programs and projects, seeks\nsolutions\nto\nensure\nfood\nsecurity,\npoverty\neradication, pollution control and environmental\nsanitation; conservation of natural resources and\ncontrol of the spreading of desertification and soil\nerosion, in addition to minimizing the anthropic\nimpacts that influence climate change. (NEMP,\n2002).\n• The Agenda of action for sustainable Energy for\nall in Guinea-Bissau, accession to the initiative of\nTHE UN Secretary-General, in November 2011, on\nSustainable Energy for all;\n• National Action Plans: Renewable Energies\n(PANER); investment in sustainable energy and\nenergy efficiency in Guinea-Bissau, 2015-2030; In\nthe framework of accession to ECOWAS/UEMOA\nregional policies through the white Paper on\nrenewable energy policy and energy efficiency.\n\n1.6.2 Strategies, plans and objectives linked\nto climate change\nIn order to stabilize the concentration of\ngreenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere at\nlevels that prevent dangerous interference with the\nplanet's climate system, the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climatic Changes\n(UNFCCC) was adopted at 1992. The Kyoto\nProtocol, currently ratified by 192 parties, entered\ninto force in February 2005, and constitutes an\ninstrument that concretizes a global reduction of\nGHG emissions of 5% in the period 2008 to 2012,\ncompared to emissions recorded in 1990. GuineaBissau ratified the UNFCCC on 27 October 1995,\nthus becoming a Contracting Party to the\nConvention, and undertook to develop, update and\nreport to the Conferences of the Parties (COP) The\nnational inventories of GHG emissions and\nremovals. The country ratified the Kyoto Protocol\non 18 November 2005. Being part of the UNFCCC is\nthus committed to participate in the GLOBAL GHG\nreduction efforts, that is, to prevent the planet's\ntemperature from increasing 2ºC and cause\nirreversible damage to the balance of natural\nsystems. Guinea-Bissau has been making efforts\ninternally to become resilient to the effects of\nclimate change, namely:\n• Drafted\nnational\nreports\non\nNational\nCommunications 1, 2 and 3, the National Action\nplan for Adapting to Climate Change;\n• The expansion of its national system of terrestrial\nand marine protected areas is under way, which will\npass from around now 12% of the national territory\nto 26% in 2020;\n• Finalized the National Action Plan for REDD+ as a\ncontribution to the mitigation of greenhouse Gases;\n• The effort to integrate environmental dimension\ninto public policies, promotion and introduction of\nenvironmental education in school curricula and in\nthe preparation of the National Strategy for\nSustainable Development, to influence the Socioeconomic development based on respect for\nenvironment paradigms.\n• In 2012 the United Nations Programme (UNDP)\nfinanced a consultation work aimed at identifying\nbarriers, gaps and capacity needs at institutional,\nhuman and systemic level for a successful\nformulation of Strategy Development to low carbon\nemission (LEDS), NAMAs and MRV system.\nThis work has laid the foundations for adopting the\ncountry with a national greenhouse gas emission\nReduction (GHG) strategy.\n\nWith regard to the implementation of the Kyoto\nProtocol,\nthe\nCARBOVEG-GB\nproject\nwas\nimplemented which brought to light data on the\nquantification of stored carbon and the sink\ncapacity of the forest vegetation of the country.\nHowever, the rate of deforestation at national level\npoints to worrying parameters, and the main\nreasons for this dynamic are itinerant farming, over-\n\n 25| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\ngrazing-exploitation, logging, excessive use of\nfirewood and coal as a source of energy mitigation\nand proliferation of cashew monoculture, among\nothers.\n1.6.3 Institutional arrangements relevant to climate change\nThe country ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 27\nOctober 1995 and ratified also the Kyoto Protocol on 18 November 2005 (IGEE, 2008) thus becoming a\ncontracting Party to the Convention, committed to develop, update, publish the National Communications\non Climate Change and other strategic documents on the same theme and participate in the Conferences\nof the Parties (COP). The national structure that the Guinea-Bissau Government has put in place for the\nregular preparation and reporting of national communication to UNFCCC had evolved from ad-hoc\nworking groups that were set up aiming at attaining permanent decentralized institutional representations\n(see Figure 1.4). The institutional arrangements for national communications and Biennial Update Reports\nare intertwined and integrated into the superstructure for coordination of planning and implementation\nof climate change. Linkages have been established with the National Programme on Climate Change\nCommittee (NPCCC) and the National Climate Change Commission, research and knowledge generation\nstructures.\n\nFigure 1.4 - Institutional arrangement for preparation of BUR 1 in Guinea-Bissau\nCONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (COP)\nUNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC)\nREPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU\nSECRETARIAT OF SATE FOR ENVIRONMENT AND\nBIODIVERSITE (SSEB)\n\nUNFCCC FOCAL POINT\n\nGEF FOCAL POINT\nNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nCOMMISSION\nInterdisciplinary Environment Body\n Government\nPrime Minister\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Intl.\nCooperation\nMinistry of Education and Scientific\nResearch\nMinistry of Natural Resources\nMinistry of Public Work, Housing and\nUrbanism\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment\nMinistry of Public Health\nMinistry of Interior\nMinistry of Energy and Industry\nMinistry\nof\nTrade,\nTourism\nand\nHandicraft\nMinistry of the Economy and Finance\nMinistry of Family, Woman and Fight\nagainst Poverty\nSecretariat of State for Environment\nSecretariat of State for Fishery and\nMarine Economy\nSecretariat of State for Transports and\ncommunications\nOther National Stakeholders\nLocal Government\nAcademic and Research Institutions\nWorkers Unions\nCommunity-Based Organizations (CBO)\nEnvironment NGOs\nAd-Hoc Project Steering\nCommittees\nNATIONAL PROGRAMME ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nCOMMITTEE (NPCCC)\nInterdisciplinary Members\nI\nBUR1 PROJECT COORDINATION UNIT:\nProject National Director (PND)\nProject National Coordinator (PNC)\nAdministrative and Financial Assistant\n(AFA)\n\nAdaptation Team Leader\nCross-cutting Issues\nTeam Leader\nMitigation Team Leader\n\n 26| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nBelow in Table 1.4 is the description of the main stakeholders involved in the preparation of the BUR 1 as\nwell as their main responsibility.\n\nTable 1.4.

Introduction\nGuinea-Bissau is a non-Annex-I Party and a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. National communications (CNs) and the biennial\nupdate reports (BUR) are part of all the obligations of the country’s parties to the UNFCCC, through which\nthey disclose the state of implementation of the Convention at national level in its different modalities.\nWhile the CNs provides Information on GHG emissions, vulnerability and climate change adaptation\nmeasures, mitigation or emission mitigation options, etc., bi-annual reports (BUR) on their side seek to\nupdate and strengthen the information contained in the CNs. Consequently, within this framework, GuineaBissau is preparing its First Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange to the COP. This First Biennial Update Report (BUR) seek to update and strengthen the information\ncontained in the Third National Communication. Therefore, the inventory estimate carried out under this\nBUR covers anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all GHG not controlled by the\nMontreal Protocol and greenhouse gas precursors and include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and\nnitrous oxide (N2O) and the indirect gases nitrogen oxides (NOx). This section of the report presents a\nsummary of the GHG results for the period 2006 -2012 (based on emission inventory statistics from 2010).\n\n 31| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.2. Socio-economic characterization\nof the country\nBissau the capital, is the largest urban centre and\neconomic and institutional centre of the country\nwith approximately 20% of the total population. The\nother major urban centres are the cities of, Gabu,\nBafatá, Canchungo and Bassorã, where there are\nsome important economic activities in the\nagricultural areas and the main transport routes.\nBesides these, there is another group of secondary\ncenters that in the past reflected some economic\nglow, such as Catió, Cachéu, Bolama and Bubaque.\n\nBissau City Center Bissau, - Francisco Mendes Avenue\nThe economy of Guinea-Bissau is mainly based on\nthe primary sector and international aid. The\nagriculture sector (mainly cashew cultivation) and\nfisheries contribute to about half of GDP, with\nservices being the second main contributor. The\nindustry sector is very poorly developed and\ncontributes less than 15% to the formation of\nnational GDP (Figure 2.1).\n\nFigure 2.1 – Guinea-Bissau’s GDP breakdown for 2016.\nThe trade balance (imports/exports) was always\nnegative, although it had presented a positive trend\nin recent years. Unilateral bank transfers represent\nan important part of GDP, taking into account that\nthey\nalso include\ntransfers\nfor\ncommercial\npurposes. The following table presents some\neconomic and social indicators relevant to the\ncontext of the present study.

The energy sector characterization\nThe energy Sector of Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed in the West-African sub-region,\nreflecting the low level of access of its populations to modern energy. In fact, the rate of access to energy\nof 16% in 2015 versus 11.5% in 2010 (of which only 10% relative to the network) reveals the undeniable delay\nof the country in relation to the same context in the sub-region and evidences, in particular, the perverse\neffects of erratic socio-economic development status of the country over the last decades. Apart from the\nfossil energy resources to be confirmed, it is considered that Guinea-Bissau is a country with many primary\nenergy resources, especially renewable, such as sun, wind, water and forests. The latter are the most\nexploited resource, due to the low technical and financial costs associated with its exploitation. It is\nimportant to underline that given the weak level of access to energy in Guinea-Bissau, all the production\nof primary energy is normally consumed in its entirety. According to the Energy Master Plan of 2013, the\nAgriculture\n49%\nIndustry\n14%\nServices\n37%\nGDP Breakdown (%), 2016\n\n 32| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nin-country supply of energy is mainly based on woody biomass (firewood and coal), which represents 87%\n(360.21 ktoe) of total primary energy production, supplemented by petroleum products (13%,\ncorresponding to 52.38 ktoe) which the latter is mostly imported (Figure 2.2).\n\n2.3.1 Electricity\nThe energy Sector of Guinea-Bissau is among the\nleast developed. The national electricity sub-sector\nhas evolved in line with the country's socioeconomic development profile, often with abrupt\ndeclines following timid progress. Since its\nindependence, Guinea-Bissau has known countless\nsocio-political crises that have had as its outcome\nrecurrent periods of instability in the sector's\npolicies\nand\nlegislations/regulations.\nThe\ninvestments for their development were postponed\nand delayed for decades, mainly due to the lack of\nconfidence of the private sector and development\npartners. However, currently the Government\nlaunched The National Action Plans for Renewable\nEnergy and Energy Efficiency to provide a coherent\nvision how to achieve universal access to\nsustainable energy services so to rapidly reduce the\ncountry’s dependence on diesel imports for power\ngeneration.\n\nFigure 2.2 – Partitioning of supply of primary energy in\nGuinea-Bissau for 2013.\n\n2.3.2 Energy consumption\nEnergy consumption in Guinea Bissau is still\ndominated by the Residential Sector, with almost\n92%, corresponding to 339 ktoe, followed by the\nTransport Sector.\nResidential Sector ― Biomass (firewood) continued\nto determine domestic consumption, with more\nthan 95%, followed by oil derivatives with about 5%.\n\nThe\ncountry's\nweak\nelectrification\nrate has\ncontinued to constrain household access, especially\nin rural areas, to modern electricity services,\njustifying\nnegligible\nelectricity\nconsumption.\nFirewood is by far the main fuel, with a demand of\nthe order of 89% of total consumption of biomass\nin rural households. Next comes the charcoal, fuel\nmainly used in the capital Bissau and which leads to\nexaggerated quantities of wood being cut from\nnational forests. Petroleum fuels, whether kerosene,\ndiesel or domestic gas, are rarely used in the\nkitchen. Kerosene and diesel fuel are mainly used\nfor home lighting, which reflects the low\nconsumption of electricity. But butane gas (LPG) is\nalso mostly used in urban centres, particularly in the\ncapital, although not massively, as most city\ndwellers remain dependent on coal and firewood,\nsuch as the bakery, military barracks and hospital\ncentres (Figure 2.3).\n\nFigure 2.3 – Consumption by type of energy in the\nResidential Sector of Guinea Bissau.\nTransport Sector ― In the Transport Sector, energy\nconsumption is dominated by the Road Transport\nSubsector (83%) in the form of diesel and gasoline,\nfollowed at a distance (6%) by the Air Subsector (Jet\nA or Gasoline Aviation) and by 1% of inland\nMaritime Navigation. essentially characterized by\ncabotage and artisanal fishing. In total, the final\nenergy consumption of the Transport Sector\nreached 34.07 ktoe in 2010.\n\nWoody\nBiomass\n(firewood\nand coal)\n87%\nOil\nProducts\n13%\nSupply of Primary Energy\nFirewood\n88,73%\nCharcoal\n6,42%\nDiesel and\nLubricants\n4,56%\nGasoline\n0,08%\nLPG\n0,18%\nElectricity\n0,03%\nConsumption by type of energy,\nResidential Sector\n\n 33| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.4. Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nThe inventory estimate carried out in the context of this BRU1 covers anthropogenic emissions by\nanthropogenic sources and removals by sinks of all GHG not controlled by the Montreal protocol and the\nprecursors of gas greenhouse effect and includes carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide\n(N2O) and indirect gases oxides of nitrogen (NOx).\n\nForest resources constitute more than 87% of the\ncountry's domestic energy needs, of which wood is\nthe most used by the population. Problems in this\nsector are related to deforestation, pastoralism, soil\nerosion, irregularity and reduced rainfall and\nincreasing population in forest areas, in short,\npressure on biodiversity.\nWhether from clearing for cultivation, local\nharvesting of wood, or for external commercial\nmarkets, the forest resources have been heavily\ndegraded by rapid exploitation. The rate of\ndeforestation has increased from about 2 percent\nper year between 1975 and 2000 to 3.9 percent over\nthe 2000 to 2013 period. Overall, Guinea-Bissau lost\nabout 77 percent of its forests between 1975 and\n2013; only 180 sq km remain, mainly in the south\nnear the Guinea border. Likewise, woodlands\nregressed by 35 percent over the 38 years, a loss of\n1,750 sq km (USAID, 2015). Successive cutting of the\ntrees and their commercialization by the population\nis currently under way to guarantee the financial\nmeans for their subsistence in rural areas. Even with\nthe extensive practice of pastoralism, logging, the\ntraditional practice of highland agriculture on tree\ncutting and burning of forests are major causes of\nforest degradation in the country. According to\nGovernment authorities, it is estimated that\nbetween 50,000 and 80,000 ha of forests are\nburned annually for farming and hunting. The\ninventory carried out from 1978 to 1985 showed\nthat the forest space had decreased about 31,500\nha in this period being Afzelia africana, Khaya\nsenegalensis and Pterocarpus erinaceus the three\nspecies most sought.\n\nHowever more recent data indicate an alarming scenario on forest degradation in the country.\nDeforestation measured as tree cover loss assessed from 2001 to 2018 for different \"tree cover threshold\"\nused for defining the tree cover area from dense forests (≥75% close canopies) to open forests (≥10%\nsparse canopies) indicate systematic losses across all threshold values (Figure 2.4).\n\nFigure 2.4 – Deforestation measured as tree cover loss assessed from 2001 to 2018 for different \"tree cover threshold”\nfor Guinea-Bissau 2001-2018 (Data Source: https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Guinea-Bissau.htm)\n\nForest degradation in open canopies are extremely high with more than 230,000 ha lost in the open forests\nof Guinea-Bissau. Yearly average losses varied from 6064 ha during the 2001-2010 period to 21,176 ha\nbetween 2011 and 2018. Forest degradation gradually decreases with increasing cover threshold (≥75%\nclose canopies) reaching 1,213 ha of tree cover within the 18 years period.

Even though the total land\nsurface covered by savanna has stayed virtually\nunaffected, the underlying dynamic is not so simple.\nThe Agricultural areas have doubled since 1975\ncovering 13 percent of the national land surface in\n2013 and becoming the second most extensive land\ncover class. Forest clearance for cultivation has\ninfringed into natural habitats in all of Guinea-\nBissau’s ecoregions except the Zone de Colline de\nBoé (ZCB – Boé Hill or Upland Zone). Whereas\nagricultural expansion explains the loss of about\n2,500 sq km of savannas (or 16 percent of their 1975\ntotal land surface), the degradation of woodlands\nand forests from logging and clearing has\nproduced open landscapes that take on the\ncharacteristics of tree and wooded savannahs,\nincreasing the area mapped as savannah in the\nsame period. Deforestation for wood production is\nresponsible for 65 percent of forest habitat losses\n(forests, woodlands, gallery forests), or 1,700 sq km\nof forest that have become savannahs in 2013.\nAgriculture in shallows and recession, in particular\nrice cultivation, colonizes alluvial floodplains in the\nZone des Estuaires (E-GB – Estuary Zone) and the\nZone Côtière (ZC-GB – Coastal Zone). Rice\ncultivated areas have slightly increased in GuineaBissau since 1975, encroaching into wetlands,\ngallery forest and mangroves. Mangroves are one\nof the major land cover classes in Guinea- Bissau,\naccounting for over 9 percent of the country’s land\nsurface. This fragile ecosystem is critical to coastal\npeople who take advantage of its rich fisheries and\nwood resources. They also use the tidal flats for\ntraditional rice cultivation (Corcoran, Ravilious, and\nSkuja, 2007). Between 1975 and 2013, mangroves\ndecreased by 6.4 percent, or 220 sq km. Bowé,\nlateritic landscapes that characterize Guinean\nplateaus, cover 3.2 percent of the country’s land\nsurface and are mainly found in the Colline de Boé\n(ZCB – Boé Hill or Upland Zone) ecoregions. These\nrocky, impenetrable soils are usually devoid of\nwoody vegetation but support an herbaceous cover\nduring the rainy season. As a result, bowé is one of\nthe most stable landscapes in Guinea-Bissau. Bowé\nis ill-suited to agriculture but conducive to grazing\n(USAID, 2015). All these partial losses in the various\ntypes of forest stand explain the staggering amount\nof total tree cover loss of 1,019,531 ha within the 18\nyears period which leads to an average yearly rate\nof tree cover loss of 56, 640 ha/year.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is an essentially agricultural and subsistence economy and agriculture remains a dominant\neconomic activity contributing to over 50% of GDP and over 80% of exports and employing around 82%\nof the working population. Rice ranks first in the government's medium- and long-term priorities for its\nplace in Guinea-Bissau's food and economy. According to estimated data from the Ministry of Agriculture\nand Rural Development (MADR) Agricultural Statistics Department, the country has 1,410,000 ha of arable\nland (agricultural potential), of which 200,000 ha of land with rice (bas-fonds rice), 106,000 ha of land with\nmangrove rice, and 110,000 ha land with pam pam rice, where forests are also found (Table 2.3).\n\n 35| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nTable 2.3 - Agricultural Statistics of the country.\n\nHowever, a growing expansion of cattle ecosystem (Table 2.4), and cashew cultivation, with the appearance\nof uncontrolled burning of forests that can significantly alter these data. This practice of extensive cattle\nranching has caused many conflicts between cattle breeders and farmers and other impacts (positive and\nnegative) in the agricultural system.\n\nTable 2.4 - Evolution of National livestock herd (extrapolated data 2013).\n\n2.5.

To overcome this\nhandicap and with a view to accomplish the\nobjectives of the BUR1, an update of sectoral data\nand information was carried. Data was gathered\nfrom sources of activities through observations,\ninterviews and surveys of the actors. During the\ninterviews and surveys, the researcher collected two\ntypes of data: primary and secondary. The primary\ndata were collected through interviews conducted\nat different public, private, NGO and communitybased organizations, including women responsible\nfor households. Teams financed by the BUR1\nproject, consisting of administration technicians,\nuniversity students and young people residing in\nthe visited locations, conducted the scheduled\nsurveys according to a mobilization plan that was\nstretched to most representative centres of the\nnational territory, involving not only the rural\ncommunities where the consumption of firewood is\npredominant and where the coal farmers produce\nthe charcoal, but also the secondary centres\n(regional and sectoral capitals), and finally the city\nof Bissau, which concentrates the main economic\nactivities using the final energy.\n\nWood Charcoal selling in Guinea-Bissau. Photo credit: LOPES\nJ.R., 2018\n\nAccording\nto\nthe\nnational\ncommunications\nprepared to date, the Energy Sector, has been\nconsidered one of the catalysts of economic\ndevelopment by the Strategic and Operational Plan\nfor 2015-2020 – “TERRA RANKA” Therefore the\nenergy Sector-is part of the preparation of the\nBiennial Update Report (BUR1) of Guinea-Bissau.\n2.6. Methodology\nAccording to the secretariat of the UNFCCC, the\nBUR of non-Annex I countries, of which GuineaBissau is part, will undergo an international\nverification\nprocess\nthrough\ninternational\nconsultancy and analysis. The inventory is at the\nnational level and covers all the IPCC sectors subject\nto availability of activity data. As per the IPCC 2006\nGuidelines, emission estimates have been compiled\nfor the four sectors: Energy, Agriculture, Forestry,\nand Other Land Use (AFOLU), Industrial Processes\nand Product Use (IPPU) and Waste. The gases\ncovered in this inventory are the direct gases\ncarbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous\noxide (N2O) and the indirect gases nitrogen oxides\n(NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane\nvolatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and sulphur\ndioxide (SO2).\n\nEmissions are attributable to the combustion of\nfossil fuels, but also to the burning of plant biomass,\ni.e. firewood and charcoal. Taking into account the\nuncertainties associated to the data used for the\nactivity sectors, given the different constraints and\nstructural gaps referred to in the preceding\nchapters, it was decided to apply the tier 1 (or Level\n1) method, recommended in the manual \"IPCC\nGuidelines, 2006 \" for situations when the body in\ncharge of the inventory has few resources and\nlimited data gathering structures. This method is\nbased in fuel, with the assumption that the\nattributable emissions from combustion sources\ncan be calculated from the quantities of burnt fuels\nand the average emission factors (F). Emissions of\ngases other than CO2 contain small amounts of\ncarbon. In relation to estimates of CO2 and, in Tier\n1, it becomes more correct to base the calculation\nof CO2 in total amount of carbon contained in the\nfuel. In fact, while the total carbon in the fuel\ndepends only on the type of fuel, emissions of other\ngases other than CO2 depend on numerous factors,\nsuch as the type of technology, maintenance, etc.,\nwhich, in general, are not known. As known, the\nemission factors vary according to the type of gas\nunder analysis Therefore, CO2 emissions can be\naccurately calculated based on the total quantity of\nburnt fuels and the average carbon content of the\nfuels.\n\n 37| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.7. National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory\n2.7.1 National emissions and removals (Gg)\nGHG emissions were calculated (Table 2.5) using the IPCC Inventory software program created for this\npurpose and based on information on the energetic balance (Reference Year: 2010). The results from these\nemissions calculations indicate that the bulk of GHG emissions in the energy Sector, in the referential year\nof 2010, was concentrated in the residential subsector and represented by carbon dioxide emissions (94%).\nThese results also suggest a high consumption of firewood and charcoal in households both in urban\ncentres and in Rural areas. Emissions are attributable to the combustion of fossil fuels, but also to the\nburning of plant biomass, i.e. firewood and charcoal.\n\nTable 2.5 – Summary of Green House Gas Emissions in the Energy Sector (extrapolated data 2013).\nSectors of\nActivity\nEnergy consumed\nTJ\nGreenhouse Gases emitted\n(Gg)\nCO2\nCH4\nN2O\n1.

In\naddition to the mandatory ' top-down ' approach\nfor\nestimating\nGHG\nemissions\nfrom\nfuel\ncombustion, the bottom-up methodology was used\nas much as possible for key inventory categories,\nusing the existing databases available in GuineaBissau. The majority of GHG was emitted (Gg\nCO2eq) in the Energy and Agriculture and Livestock\nsectors. The contributions of Industry and Waste\nsectors were marginal. The summary of the results\nbased on the data of 2010 is shown in Figure 2.5.\n\nEnergy\n\nAgriculture\n\nWaste\n\nIndustry\n\nFigure 2.5 – The contributions of GHG emissions in the Energy sector, Agriculture, Industry and Waste sectors in\nGuinea-Bissau (2010).\n\n94%\n2%\n4%\nSolid waste\nWaste water and\nSludge\nHuman waste\n27%\n10%\n4%\n1%\n58%\nLivestock\nPaddy Rice\nAgriculture Waste\nBurning of\nSavannahs\nLand Cultivation\n35%\n3%\n3%\n2%\n0%\n1%\n54%\n2%\nTransport\nComercial &\nInstitutional\nSelf-generation,\nown generation\nInternational\nBunkers\nAgriculture &\nFisheries\n Industrial Sector\nOil products\n2%\n70%\n28%\nCashew nut wine\nCashew nut bandy\nSugar cane brandy\n\n 41| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nThe graphs below show the percentage values according to the contribution of different sub sectors that\nmake up the AFOLU sector in Guinea-Bissau (Figure 2.6a) and the GHG emissions according to gases for\n2010 inventory (Figure 2.6b).\n\nFigure 2.6 – a) The percentage contributions of the AFOLU sub sectors; and b) distribution of emissions by gas (2010).\n\nIt can be observed that GHG emission from Land\nUse and Change dominated the AFOLU sector\nfollowed by the Livestock sub sector. CO2 emissions\ndominate the total GHG emissions by representing\n-573.6 Gg CO2eq, followed by CH4 with 112.3, N2O\nwith 7.5 and halogenated gases with 0.02.\n\n2.8. Projections of Greenhouse Gases\nThe projection of GHG emissions serves to estimate\nthe future evolution of the country's emissions\nprofile in the context of the sector's activities and to\nmake sure that they maintain their normal course\nand pace, without the need for interventions that\nmay influence the socioeconomic activity. After the\ncalculations using the IPCC methodology, the\nemission results for Guinea-Bissau and all these\nyears ahead 2020, 2030 and 2050 correspond to\nzero (0). That is to say that, until the last year of this\nprojection, Guinea-Bissau will not be a net emitter\nof none of the AFOLU-related greenhouse gases\ndue to the high sequestration capacity of the\nnational forests.\n\nIt is true that under the baseline scenario, all GHG emissions are projected to gradually rise from the base\nyear (2010) to 2050 particularly in the Agriculture and Livestock and the Waste sectors, that are expected\nto experience a dramatic increase in GHG emission. These GHG emission increases are made markedly\nfrom an accentuated growth in CH4 gas. This can be seen in Figure 2.8 showing the evolution of GHG\nemissions for 1994, 2006 and 2010, aggregated in Gg CO2-eq and Gg by gas in Guinea-Bissau.\nTable 2.8 – Emissions for 1994, 2006 and 2010, aggregated in Gg CO2-eq and Gg by gas in Guinea-Bissau.\nSource\nBase Year\nGreenhouse Gas Emission\nTotal\n(Gg-Eq CO2)4\nCO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\n(Gg)\nN2O\n(Gg)\nNC 1\n1994\n178.58\n0.36\n0.99\n179.90\nNC 2\n2006\n156,00\n79.59\n6.20\n241.79\n\nBUR 1\n2010\n1338.79\n87.26\n130.58\n1556.64\n\n4 The Total was obtained after application of the Global warming potentials of the Gees Referenced (GWP: CO2 = 1; Ch4 = 21; N2O =\n310, established by the IPCC in its report AR5 of 2014).\n112.3\n-573.6\n7.5\nTotal Emissions by Gas\nCH4\nCO2\nN2O\nNox\nCO\n15%\n2%\n-82%\n-1%\nAmounts as a percentage of emissions in\nthe AFOLU Sector\nGado\nEmissões de\nGases ñ CO2 em\nTerras Quiemadas\nTerras\nOutros\nLivestock\nNon-CO2 gas\nemissions in\nburned land\nLand Use &\nChange\nemissions\nOther\n\n 42| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nThe rising demand for food (paddy rice crop and\nmeat production) will drive the expected increases\nin emissions of CH4 in the baseline scenario\nespecially in the Agriculture & Livestock sector. The\nrelease of CH4 will stem mainly from the decay of\nflooded organic matter in paddy rice crop and from\nenteric fermentation from the livestock sub-sector.\nGHG emission from enteric fermentation from\nLivestock sector will keep its growing pace as\nthe Guinea-Bissau agriculture system is still\ndominated by the practice of extensive cattle\nranching characterised by sedentary livestock\nbreeding as well as transhumance livestock\nproduction. In addition, there are expectation\nthat the Industry sector of Guinea-Bissau will\nincrease, given the population growth and the\ntechnological advance expected to see happening\nin the current industry sectors and those new\nemerging activities so that the GHG emission in this\nsector\nmay\nalso\nincrease.\nFurthermore,\nDeforestation is also responsible for the release of\nlarge amounts of CO2 by loosening up carbon\nstored in forest soils, increasing the chances it will\nreturn to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and by\nreducing the carbon sequestration capacity of the\ncountry.\n\nNotwithstanding the above expected rises in\nGHG emission, the Land Use, Land-Use Change\nand Forestry (LULUCF) is still the highest single\nsector acting as a net sink of GHG amounting to 10718 Gg for the year 2010. Therefore, GuineaBissau is and will remain as an absolute sink of\ngreenhouse gases, given the high potential for\nsequestration by the Forestry sub-sector and the\nFramework Law on sustainable development\npromoting the expansion of the national Protected\nAreas as well as the implementation of the country's\nbiodiversity protection policy.\n\n 43| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.9.

However, Guinea-Bissau being\ncommitted to fulfil the objectives of article 2, of the\nConvention,\nspecifically\nthe\n\"stabilisation\nof\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere at a level that would prevent\ndangerous anthropic interference in the climate\nsystem\", has developed several policies and\nstrategies that guide its development agenda,\npromoting sustainable development, minimizing\nthe social, environmental and economic impacts of\nanthropogenic\nactivities\nthat\ncontribute\nto\ngreenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, to global\nwarming. Guinea-Bissau has been involved in\nvarious projects and activities aimed at reducing\nGHG emissions and increasing its sink capacity,\nparticularly through its\nEnergy, Forest and\nBiodiversity sectors.\n\n3.2.1 The national mitigation System\nGuinea-Bissau's\nNational\nMitigation\nSystem\nconsists of an entire institutional, legal chain of\nprocesses and arrangement made to estimate\nemission reductions, as well as the reporting and\narchiving of mitigation information. The Directorate\nGeneral for the Environment (DGA) of the Republic\nof Guinea-Bissau is the designated mitigation\nassessment agency and hosts the UNFCCC and GEF\nfocal points. It is responsible for National Climate\nChange Communications and is also the state\nauthority\nresponsible\nfor\ndeveloping\nand\npromoting policies and strategies for mitigating /\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country\nin the short, medium and long term through\nenvironmental protection, rational use of natural\nresources and biodiversity conservation. The other\nmain national bodies relevant to the climate change\nmitigation legal framework are:\n1. The National Authority designated for the Kyoto\nMechanisms (DNA)-created by Decree No. 11/2006,\ndated August 22nd. DNA is a national body that\ndeals with the approval and monitoring of the\nimplementation of projects under the Clean\ndevelopment Mechanism and REDD framework.\n2. The National Committee on Climate Change\n(NCCC)-is supervised by The Secretariat of State of\nEnvironment and Biodiversity (SEAB) and consists of\nan advisory board, a Scientific Council and a\ntechnical committee. The role of the NCCC is to\nstimulate the awareness and mobilization of\nGuinean Society for discussion and position in\nrelation to the phenomenon of climate change, with\nthe following main mitigation objectives:\n▪ Discuss and validate the mitigation/mitigation\nmeasures of greenhouse gas emissions in the\ncountry, in the short, medium and long term;\n▪ (b) Discussing and validating measures to adapt\nto the adverse effects of climate change;\n▪ c) Discuss and validate the implementation of\nincentive instruments and measures to mitigate the\nimpacts of climate change and natural disasters;\n▪ d) Discuss and validate ways to stimulate the\nconsumption or use of products with zero carbon\ncontent;\n▪ e) Promote the implementation of projects under\nthe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as well\nas other innovative forms of mitigation/reduction\nfinancing.\n\nWithin SEAB, the NCCC unit carries out the daily\nsupervision of the mitigation assessment and is\nresponsible for organizing and developing the\nactivities included in the annual work plan for the\nsector mitigation teams, assisting in the request for\ndata and Ensuring that tasks are submitted on time.\nThis unit is also responsible for identifying the\nvarious institutions that constitute the mitigation\nassessment\nWorking\nGroup.\nThe\nNational\nmitigation\nWork\nGroup\nincludes\nministerial\nrepresentatives from the main sectors involved in\nthe national mitigation inventory, such as energy,\nwaste management, AFLOU and cross-cutting\nissues.\n\n3.3 Voluntary Pledge\nNotwithstanding the expected rises in GHG\nemission in Guinea-Bissau, as deliberated in\nthe preceding chapter, the quantum of\nGuinea-Bissau’s total GHG emissions (including\n\nLULUCF) in 2010 was: -10718 Gg/year. This level of\nemission is far lower than GHG emissions of China,\nUSA, the EU and for example India’s per capita GHG\nemission in 2010 which was 1.56 metric tonnes\nCO2eq. The Guinea-Bissau’s emission pattern is\n\n 48| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nsuch that Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry\n(LULUCF) is still the highest single sector acting as a\nnet sink of GHG in 2010. By contrast, GHG emissions\nfrom oil products and transport are significant in\nthe Energy Sector and so does the GHG emissions\nfrom land cultivation and livestock in the\nAgriculture and livestock sectors.\n\nDeforestation and wildfires are also responsible for\nemitting\nlarge\namounts\nof\nCO2\ninto\nthe\natmosphere. It is therefore, under this background\nand in accordance with the provisions of Article 12,\nparagraphs 1(b) and 4, and Article 10, paragraph\n2(a), of the Convention, that Guinea-Bissau\ncommunicated its voluntary pledge to reduce the\nemissions\nintensity.\nConsequently,\nthe\nmain\nmitigation measure to be adopted by the country,\nas\na\nnational\ncontribution,\nis\nrelated\nto\nreforestation. The second sector that the country\nplans in using to contribute to the mitigation\nstrategy is the Energy sector even though the\naverage electrification rate of the country is about\n12% and Guinea-Bissau remains one of the\ncountries facing the greatest need of access to\nmodern forms of energy in Africa and the world.\n\nWildfires in Guinea-Bissau\n\n3.3 National Mitigation Policies\nThe above legal structure that supports the processes and arrangements to estimate the emission\nreduction, as well as the monitoring of the results, is sustained mainly in:\n• The new forestry Law, Decree-Law 5/2011, establishes the rule of law concerning the management of\nforest heritage, forestry planning, sale of forestry products, forest management and exploration contracts,\nforest cleaning, prevention and combating Forest fire and community forests.\n\nHowever, the Government of Guinea-Bissau has\nelaborated and implemented a wide range of\npolicies that relate directly or indirectly to climate\nchange and GHG mitigation:\n• The Land Law (“Lei de Terra”) was approved by the\nPopular National Assembly (ANP). This instrument\nregulates the management of space in the national\nterritory and, in particular, brings discipline and\nminimizes the problems associated with land\nconcessions for different purposes. However, this\nlaw recognizes two fundamental aspects. Forest\nreserves and the recognition of customary law of\ncommunity land management.\n• Framework Law on Protected Areas (PA), an\ninstrument that aims above all to create a legal\nframework conducive to the conservation of fragile\necosystems in Guinea-Bissau. It also regulates the\nclassification system and the declassification of\nprotected areas at national level.\n• Forestry Law-2011: The rules and forest taxation\nhave been updated and are being applied\nthroughout the national territory. This new forestry\nlaw attaches great importance to aspects of\nreforestation, overexploitation in areas where there\nare sawmills and areas with potential problems of\nland degradation.\n• Mining and Minerals law. This Law regulates the\ndifferent forms of exploitation of mineral resources\nin the country. Most minerals in the country are in\nforest areas susceptible to degradation in case of\npoor management. The law can contribute to meet\nthe standards of concern for environmental\nprotection.\nProtected Area Cacheu -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\n\n 49| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nThe holder of the operating licence must, under\npenalty of sanctions, strive to reconcile the work of\nexploitation with the environment. For example, the\noperating licenses granted to quarries in general\nwill only be issued if they are discovered that do not\nadversely affect the environment.\n• The National Forest Executive Plan (National\nForest Action Plan) contains a detailed analysis of\nthe situation on which policies are defined, the\nstrategies, actions and goals to be achieved, the use\nof durable forestry resources amongst others. It\nalso\ndefines\nthe\nmeans\nnecessary\nfor\nits\nimplementation in the following main issues:\n\n-Techniques for the use of forest space by the\npopulation to fight food insecurity;\n-Burning linked to shifting cultivation and hunting;\n-Extensive livestock and increased transhumance;\n-The use of fire as the main instrument of\ndeforestation and renovation of pastures;\n-The process of deforestation to create new\nagricultural land for cash crops (especially cashew\nnuts, peanuts and cotton);\n-Overexploitation of forest species of high\ncommercial value;\n-Increase in hunting camps and illegal hunters;\n-Increase in population density and appearance of\nnew Tabancas (small villages) in the wildlife\ncorridors.\n• The National Environmental Management Plan\n(NEMP), the main document and regulator of\nenvironmental\nissues\nin\nGuinea-Bissau.\nThis\ndocument contains the main concerns of other\ndevelopment sectors, not only in terms of\nconservation, but also of development itself. The\nplan, through programs and projects, seeks\nsolutions\nto\nensure\nfood\nsecurity,\npoverty\neradication, pollution control and environmental\nsanitation; Conservation of natural resources and\ncontrol of the spreading of desertification and soil\nerosion, in addition to minimizing the anthropic\nimpacts that influence climate change. (NEMP,\n2002).\n• The Agenda of Action for Sustainable Energy for\nAll in Guinea-Bissau, accession to the initiative of\nThe UN Secretary-General, in November 2011, on\nSustainable Energy for all;\n• National Action Plans: Renewable Energies\n(PANER); investment in sustainable energy and\nenergy efficiency in Guinea-Bissau, 2015-2030; In\nthe framework of accession to ECOWAS/UEMOA\nregional policies through the white Paper on\nRenewable Energy Policy and the Energy Efficiency\n\n3.4 Mitigation Policy Measures\nThe Guinea-Bissau mitigation strategy encompasses the implementation of unconditional actions and\npolicies complemented by other conditional measures supported mainly by bilateral or international\nfunding. Unconditional mitigation actions include legislative initiatives (laws, acts, policies, regulations and\nmandates) that are promulgated to protect and administer the environment and are adopted by the\nGovernment of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to facilitate reduction of GHG emissions. In addition, this is\ncomplemented by the national implementation of specific energy-saving policies and the prolonged use\nof alternative energy sources, in accordance with the measures provided for in the existing national strategy\npapers. These strategic documents include the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP II) and the\nnational strategic document-TERRA RANKA 2015-2025.\n\nThe mitigation measures are based on published\ndocuments and the consultation carried out by the\nnational\nteam\nwith\nstakeholders\nfor\nthe\ndevelopment of the third communication. Due to\nthe lack of detailed preliminary studies to formulate\nquantifiable concrete actions, the period up to 2020\nshould be devoted to in-depth studies to enable\nthe implementation of measures in forestry,\nindustry and energy. For example, reforestation,\nconservation of other forests and a program for the\ninclusion of renewable energy sources in the\ncountry's energy mix.\n\n3.4.1 Mitigation measures in the\nAgriculture and Forestry sector (AFLOU)\nIn comparison with other countries in the subregion, Guinea-Bissau seems to have preserved its\nenvironmental\nequilibrium.\nHowever,\nthe\nintensification of economic activities in certain\nareas, such as agriculture and fisheries, and in the\nextractive industries in particular, can be a real\nthreat to the ecosystem and the sustainability of\nnatural resources. The problems of this specific\nsector are related to deforestation (through forest\nfires, illegal timber extraction, removal of firewood\n\n 50| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nused directly or to produce coal), excessive grazing,\nsoil erosion, irregularity and decreased rainfall and\nincreased population in forest areas, finally,\npressure on forest and soil degradation and\nconsequently the loss of biodiversity. Therefore,\nthere is an urgent need to act in order to adapt and\nmitigate the adverse effects of climate change and\nanthropogenic damage to the country's natural\nresources.\n\nProtected Area -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\n\nSince the mitigation actions available, such as\nnatural regeneration, short-spin forestry and\nbioenergy for replacing fossil fuels, are not currently\npracticable mitigation options, the Government of\nGuinea-Bissau has capitalized efforts to Mitigation\nin the action of forest protection with a focus on the\nestablishment and effective management of\nprotected areas (APs).\n\nProtected Areas (APs) are areas normally classified\nby Decree with the purpose of safeguarding certain\necosystems as well as the populations of animals\nand plants that housed by them, their ecological\ndiversity as well as promoting their sustainable\nsocial and economic use. The Guinea-Bissau\nNational Protected Areas Network currently has six\nMarine and Coastal Parks, and the expansion\nprocess to 26.3% of the national territory was\naccomplished through the \"Support Project for the\nConsolidation of a System of Protected Areas in the\nForest Belt\". Guinea-Bissau \", which aimed at the\ncreation of the last five new Protected Areas in the\nDulombi, Boé and Tchetche (DBT) complex. These\nnew areas just being created retain biodiversity\nvalues of rare importance, such as chimpanzees and\nsub-humid Guinean forests with high development\npotentials, particularly in the tourism sector\n(ecotourism). Examples of Guinea-Bissau Protected\nAreas are:\n\n• Bolama Bijagós Archipelago Biosphere Reserve\n• Urok Islands Community Protected Marine Area\n• Cantanhez National Park\n• João Vieira Marine National Park and Poilão\n• Orango Islands National Park\n• Cufada Ponds Natural Park\n• Cacheu Mangrove Natural Park (“Tarrafes”)\n• Dulombi, Boe and Tchetche Complex (DBT)\n\nThe above complex represents the National System\nof Protected Areas (SNAP). Currently, the National\nSystem of Protected Areas (SNAP) covers a total\nsurface of about 750,000 ha, or about 26,3% of the\nNational\nTerritory,\nunder\nthe\nadministrative\nresponsibility of the Institute for Biodiversity and\nProtected Areas (lBAP). Two thirds of the protected\nsurface correspond to marine or estuarine spaces.\nMarine Protected Areas and regulated fishing zones\nare at the centre of concerns of IBAP and other\ninstitutions in the subregion, grouped under a\nRegional\nCoastal\nand\nMarine\nConservation\nPartnership in West Africa (PRCM). These areas play\na central role in the reproduction and regeneration\nof fish, shrimp and shellfish stocks, ensuring the\nsustainability of the exploitation of these strategic\nresources.\n\nProtected Area -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\nTwo programmes are being used to start the\nconstruction of key and lasting structures, at the\nlevel\nof\nbiodiversity\nin\nGuinea-Bissau:\nThe\nFramework Law on Protected Areas and the\nstrengthening of the Institute of Biodiversity and\nProtected areas (IBAP) under the supervision of the\nSecretariat of State of Environment and Biodiversity\n(SEAB) and the BioGuinea Foundation, which will\ncomplement the current financing model for the\ncontinuation\nof\nfinancial\nsupport\nthrough\nsustainable financial flows. IBAP is responsible for\nthe management of the National System of\n\n 51| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nProtected Areas (SNAP) and the implementation of\nthe country's biodiversity protection policy.\nThe entire set of protected areas and their\nrespective range of influence covers a significant\npart of the territory (26,34%), containing the most\nimportant and more relevant countries forest and\nmangrove forest spots.\n\nProtected Area -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\nThe mitigation action involves the effective\nmanagement and implementation of regulations\non APs to improve biomass volumes and including\nthe upgrading of deforestation and carbon\nemission baselines and field data collection for\nmonitoring in two Protected areas: Cacheu and\nCantanhez through the National System of\nProtected Areas (SNAP) this implies that the benefit\nof the carbon increment would be harvested\nthrough increases in biomass above the soil and in\nthe soil carbon densities. The Annual Carbon\nIncrement (IAC) has not yet been estimated, but the\nassumption is that above-ground biomass and soil\ncarbon densities would increase annually and\nwould be considered as potential carbon reduction\nresulting from the direct Forest protection or\nconservation action. As regards this issue and the\nadditional mitigation measures undertaken by the\nGovernment of Guinea-Bissau in this sector, it is\nworth highlighting the following key milestones:\n\nForestry sector\nThe\ncreation\nof\nprotected\nareas\nfor\nthe\nconservation\nand\nmanagement\nof\nnatural\nresources, one of the largest achievements in the\ncountry that currently correspond 26.34%. Other\nkey and relevant measures for Mitigation include:\n• In spite of all deficiencies in combating illegal\ntimber extraction and forest degradation, the\ngovernment of Guinea-Bissau signed the United\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification,\nwhich led to the creation of the Action Plan to fight\nDrought and Desertification in order to develop\nstrategies and actions to combat the phenomena of\ndesertification in the country;\n• The development of the National Forest Action\nPlan in the years 90 at the legislative level;\n• The recent launch of the Community Forestry\nManagement initiative using integrated land\n\nmanagement approaches in the Tabancas (small\nvillages) (GITT);\n• The approval of the new forestry law,\nencouraging\nthe\ncreation\nof\ncommunity\nmanagement forests at the level of the DirectorateGeneral for Forest management;\n• As described in above, the current extension\nprocess of protected areas, at national level, with\nthe specific inclusion of the forests of Dulombi Boé\nand the respective corridors that interconnect, still\nin progress.\nIn short, this sector lacks the establishment and\nscheduling of a new forestry policy. The vision is a\nsustainable management of forest resourcesincluding through the conservation and restoration\nof forests-to improve a socioeconomic balance that\nmeets the needs of communities and guarantees\ntheir responsibility;\n\nLivestock sector\nLivestock products account for about 30% of agricultural GDP. Despite the importance of livestock farming\nin the economic, socio-cultural and nutritional level, the public investment portion planned for this\nsubsector remained relatively low and steadily decreasing in the last 30 years. However, the Government\nhas taken some measures that contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change. This includes:\n• The outline of the Charter of Livestock Development Policy, which provides, among others, pastoral\nvocational areas and the conception of water withholding structures;\n• The development of studies to support the development of production of short-cycle animals ensured\nmainly by women who can also decrease the CH4 emission of enteric fermentation.\n\n 52| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\n\n3.4.2 Mitigation measures in the Energy\nsector\nThe widespread absence of basic infrastructure is,\nfor many years, one of the most serious restrictions\nwith which the national economy is confronted. The\nconsumption of electricity in Guinea-Bissau is one\nof\nthe\nlowest\nin\nthe\nworld:\nabout\n0.3\ntoe/person/year, and only 40% of the inhabitants of\nthe capital, Bissau, have access to electricity\ncompared to 20% of rural areas (PRSP II, 2011). In\ngeneral, GHG emissions in the residential subsector\nare extremely dependent, on the pace of\npopulation growth and the number of households\non the one hand, and on the other hand in the\nelectrification rate, which usually determine the\nlevel of the emission category. Therefore, the\nprojected growth in emissions of this sector\ncorresponds to the energy demands of urban\nhouseholds, followed by the emissions of rural\nhouseholds and the use of energy in transportation\n(land, sea and air). In Guinea-Bissau, stoves for\ncooking fed on wood and coal constitute the largest\nsource of emission, thus becoming a priority area of\nmitigation.\nThe general objectives of the Government's\napproach to the implementation of prioritized\nmitigation measures are to ensure the continuous\nreduction of GHG emissions while safeguarding\nsustainable growth and development. At this stage,\nthe implementation of these actions is through:\ni) integration of these mitigation objectives into\nnational,\ndistrict\nand\nsectoral\nplans\nand\nprogrammes;\nii) promotion of specific and personalized actions,\ninvolving the mobilization of adequate resources\nfrom international sources; and\nIII) facilitating the implementation of specific actions\nin the subcategories of energy production and\nconsumption, domestic energy and renewable\nenergy; and\nIV) conducting studies on the energy potential of\nthe country and defining the energy development\nby incorporating the greatest possible potential of\nrenewable energies in the energy mix;\n\nEnergy production and consumption\n• The recent approval of the Energy sector\nDevelopment Policy Charter;\n• The formulation of the National Policy for the\nPromotion of Renewable Energy (wind, solar,\nbiomass);\n• The implementation of programs financed by the\nCILSS and the World Environmental Fund, UNDP,\nwhich allowed the installation of small-scale solar\npanels to provide electrical energy and collective\nneeds of the country (basic health centers, Schools\nand telecommunications);\n• The ongoing construction of a new power plant\nto replace the current plant of Bissau, which does\nnot\ncomply\nwith\nenvironmental\nregulations,\nparticularly in terms of GHG emissions;\n• Completion of the energy master plan to support\nthe restoration and promotion of the electricity\nproduction system financed by the World Bank and\nthe EU.\n\nDomestic energy\nWood fuel (firewood and charcoal) provides\napproximately 90% of the energy consumed in the\ncountry. Currently, the country's forest formations\nsuffer strong pressure due to increasing population\ndemand and growth, especially in rural areas, which\nare heavily dependent on traditional energy (8595% of the population uses coal and wood for\ncooking). The following steps have been taken so\nfar, by the GoGB, to mitigate the GHG release\nassociated with the production of wood fuel:\nFirewood\n• In this context, national authorities, NGOs and\nbasic associations have undertaken various actions,\nsuch as monitoring, dissemination of improved\nstoves and braziers, improvement of carbonization\ntechniques and promotion of other types of fuel,\nsuch as butane gas, solar energy, etc.;\n\n• The Government also integrated its internal\nEnergy Policy into the NEPAD Energy Strategy,\nwhich could substantially improve the achievement\nof domestic targets for reducing energy scarcity.\n\n 53| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nRenewable energy\nRenewable energies (water, solar, wind, biomass)\nare potential sources for Guinea-Bissau, since the\nresources are abundant. In this sector, the following\nsteps were undertaken to mitigate the GHG release:\n• Three biomass-based energy production pilot\nunits were built with the support of UEMOA (Union\nEconomique and Monétaire Ouest Africaine);\n• The\nCharter\nof\nthe\nNational\nEnergy\ndevelopment Policy, now in force, was drafted in\n2007 to (i) accelerate rural electrification by means\nof local initiatives; and (ii) prepare the guidelines for\nthe wood fuel supply scheme;\n• Organization of the Investment Program in the\nconstruction of the hydroelectric dam under the\nenergy project of the Gambia River Basin\nOrganization (OMVG) in West Africa;\n• Three rural electrification projects based on\nsolar energy and biofuels financed through the\nEnergy facility II (European Union) mechanism;\n• The planned development of two hydroelectric\npower plants identified so far: dams of Saltinho\n(14MW) and Cussilintra (13MW);\n\nBambadinca Solar Plant - Guinea Bissau\nhttp://suniaenergy.com/trabajos/central-solar-de-bambadincaguinea-bissau/\n\n3.4.3 Mitigation measures in the Waste sector\nIn the solid waste category, the growing trend in emissions is closely linked to population growth,\nurbanization rate and population living standards. With a national population projected in Guinea-Bissau\nto be well above the 3 million in 2050 and with a per capita waste production of 0.32 kg/day, the total\nannual solid waste should reach more than 1 million tons per year. Therefore, the management of such\ngenerated waste volumes represents a major logistical problem and challenges the municipal financial\ncapacity to solve the waste problem.\n\nThe main problem currently faced by urban centers\nin the main cities of Guinea-Bissau is the project of\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects for\nthe construction of controlled dumps and sanitary\nlandfills. Therefore, the Government should soon be\nable to complement the current efforts to build\nlandfills with exploiting the recycling potential and\nderive energy production from waste. Waste\nrecycling is a process of emission reductions,\ncontributing to the development of agriculture, the\nproduction of electricity from biogas and fuel\nbriquettes for cooking. In fact, local communities\nthat are already aware of waste-related problems\ndo\nnot\nreadily\naccept\nthe\ncreation\nof\ndumps/landfills in their respective communities.\nThus, the degree of awareness of open-pit waste\nhelps them to play a very important role in the\nacceptance or not of the development of the\nproject.\n\nCurrently the technology used in Guinea-Bissau for\nthe treatment of waste is rudimentary and restricted\nto the burning of open-air debris, with the emission\nof CO2, CO, N2O into the atmosphere. Therefore,\nthere is a great need to implement sophisticated\ncomposting and incineration technologies, if\npossible, depending on the cost-benefit analysis\nand also the involvement of the private sector.\n\n3.5 Mitigation Scenario\nA mitigation scenario reveals a future in which explicit policies and measures are adopted to reduce the\nsources (or increase the sinks) of the GHGs. These measures can be carried out as a way of having the\nprojects to be implemented in a specific sector or subsector of GHG.\n\n 54| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\n3.5.1 Projects in the mitigation scenario\n\"Business as Usual\" (BAU) is the base scenario for\nGHG emissions considered for the evaluation of\nprojections of elected categories of GHG emission\nsources. This scenario assumes the continuation of\ngeneral practices and relations at national level. The\nestimates of GHG projections were, therefore,\nobtained from the evolution of the variables usually\nresponsible for emissions or removals. The fuel\ndemands to meet future energy needs, projected\nnumber of vehicles, expected changes in land use,\nforest\nmanagement\nand\namount\nof\nwaste\ngenerated are some of these variables considered.\nOther factors that could potentially affect the\nunderlying stability in the evolution of GHG\nemissions and removals are the socio-economic\ndynamics. The projections in the basic scenario\n(BAU) for industrial production are associated with\nthe growth of GDP, since it is such a dynamic sector,\nwith new industries initiating operations and others\nclosing as the country advances. The list of projects\nthat Guinea-Bissau proposed during the initial\ncommunication is presented below (Table 3.1).\nAmong them, there are several mitigation projects\nthat still require funding to be implemented and\ncontribute to a potential reduction of GHG\nemissions. Based on this valuation of GHG\nemissions and projections of this inventory, it is\nnecessary a renewed cost and prioritization of\nmitigation projects and evaluation of the reduction\nor potential improvement of GHG during the years\n2020, 2030 and 2050.\n\nTable 3.1 – List of projects that Guinea-Bissau proposed during the initial communication.\nOrder of\npriorities\nProject designation\nGeographic area of intervention\n1\nProject\nsupporting\nthe\ndiversification\nof\nproduction and diet (Quinara and Tombali\nregions)\nSouthern Province (Quinara and Tombali regions)\n2\nRural Drinking Water Supply Improvement\nProject\nSouthern Province (Quinara and Tombali regions) Eastern\nProvince (Bafata and Gabu regions)\n3\nProject for strengthening the Capacity for\nProtection of Mangrove rice fields against high\ntide Water Invasion\nSouthern Province (Tombali and Quinara Bolama/Bijagós\nregion) Northern Province (Cacheu region)\n4\nClimate Change Impact Assessment Project for\nProducing Sectors\nNorthern Province (Cacheu) region South Province\n(Bolama region/Bijagós)\n5\nCoastal Zone Erosion Monitoring Project\nProvince of the north (Cacheu) Province of the South\n(Bolama region/Bijagós)\n6\nEvaluation of the impact of climate change on\nthe project sectors of producers\nThroughout the national territory\n7\nSmall-scale Irrigation development Project over\nGeba and Corubal River Banks\nEast Province (Bafata and Gabu province) Northern\nProvince (Oio region)\n8\nNatural Disaster Prevention Project\nThroughout the national territory\n\n9\nFisheries and Coastal Resources Protection,\nConservation and Valorization Project\nCoastal Zone (North and South Province)\n10\nIntegrated Food Safety Information System\n(SISA) Project\nThroughout the national territory\n11\nCoastal\nEnvironmental\nEducation\nand\nCommunication Project\nCoastal Zone (North and South Province)\n12\nProject for Rehabilitation of Mangrove plots for\nrice growing in Tombali, Quínara, Bafatá and Oio\nEast Province (Bafatá region) Northern Province (Oio\nregion) Southern Province (Quinara and Tombali)\n13\nShort Cycle Animal Production Support Project\nEast Province (Bafatá region) Northern Province (Oio\nregion) Southern Province (regions of Quinara and\nTombali)\n14\nProject for Reforestation of Degraded Areas\nEastern Province (Bafatá region)\n\n 55| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\n\n3.6 State of Implementation of Mitigation Actions and their Effects in GuineaBissau\n\n3.6.1 Consumption pattern in the Energy Sector\nAccording to UNIDO (2017), Guinea‑Bissau is confronted with serious energy supply problems, which are\nmainly occurring due to the need for importation of petroleum products to meet the demand of the\ntransport, industry, part of mechanized agriculture and the residential sector (lighting oil and liquefied\npetroleum gas) and the excessive exploitation of biomass resources. The importation of petroleum\nproducts accounts for about 8% of the nominal GDP and 12% of the actual GDP and the depletion of the\nsupply resources of the biomass amounts to about 82% of the total consumption of the country. In 2012,\nthe final energy consumption increased by 23% compared to 2010, reaching 4,941.63 GWh (Table 3.2).\n\nTable 3.2 – Final energy consumption by sector and by category (Adapted from UNIDO, 2017).\n\nAs shown before in the emission section, the\nresidential sector continued to be the sector that\nrecorded the highest consumption, and responsible\nfor almost all consumption in 2012 (83%) and in\n2010 (94.8%). Firewood was the preferred form of\nenergy used. This sector is followed by the tertiary\nsector (6.8%), by transport (4.9%) and the industrial\nsector (3.6%). Thus, the energy needs of the\nresidential sector were ensured in its entirety by the\nconsumption\nof\nfirewood.\nHence,\nfirewood\n(3,704.00 GWh) and charcoal (720.51 GWh) were the\nforms of energy most in demand in 2012, followed\nby petroleum products (484.46 GWh), electricity\n(27.49 GWh) and others (5.17 GWh). Petroleum\nproducts are the energy form most used in the\npublic electricity production of and transport\nsectors.\n\nAccording to UNIDO, electricity demand in 2010\nwas about 141 GWh, with the residential sector\naccounting for about 56% of this. Between 2010 and\n2013, electricity demand increased at an average\nannual rate of about 3.2%, reaching 182 GWh in\n2013, and although the residential sector remains\nresponsible for a large part of the demand, other\nsectors were responsible for the increase.\n\nElectricity demand is expected to increase to 546\nGWh by 2030 - which was estimated on the basis of\nlast years' supply as well as the recorded output.\nThus, there is an urgent need for mitigation actions\ntargeted at the residential sector, particularly for\nprojects leading to a decrease in the use of\nfirewood and charcoal as sources of domestic\nenergy\n\n3.6.1 Mitigation Actions in the Energy\nSector\nBased on the BUR guidelines and as described in\nDecision 2 / CP.17, Annex III, Section IV information\non mitigation actions and their effects will be\nreported here, as far as possible.

Thus,\nin the framework of the application of this Article 4 in conjunction with Article 12 - Decisions 10 / CP2 and\n17 / CP8, the country is required to periodically submit its National Communications (NCs) by providing\ninformation through GHG inventories (emissions and absorption sources), vulnerability assessment and\nclimate change adaptation measures, emission mitigation or mitigation options, among others. UNFCCC\nDecisions 1 / CP.16 and 2 / CP.17 urge Non-Annex I Parties to submit their Biennial Update Reports (BUR)\nto provide an update on the data and information contained in the most recent CNs on adjustments related\nto climate change. The Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report (BUR 1) aims, on the one hand, to\nstrengthen national technical and institutional capacities for the preparation of national circumstances and\nBiennial Update and, on the other hand, to update the data and information contained in recent NCs, in\nparticular those related to national circumstances and institutional arrangements, Greenhouse Gas (GHG)\ninventories, constraints, gaps and needs related to technical and financial capacities, support received and\nall Monitoring information, Reporting and Verification (MRV).\nUrok Community Protected Marine Area - , Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau\n\n 70| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 4: Financial, Technology, Capacity Needs and Support\nReceived\nThis Chapter intends to report the results on\nidentified constraints and gaps, financial, technical\nand capacity-building needs and to describe the\nsupport received for the implementation of Climate\nChange-related Activities / Projects / Programs,\nincluding the preparation and presentation of this\nBUR 1.

The country has not yet\nestimated the cost-benefit of climate change (costeffectiveness\nof\nadaptation,\nmitigation\nand\ntechnology transfer). Regarding adaptation, the\n\n 81| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 4: Financial, Technology, Capacity Needs and Support\nReceived\nProject “Strengthening Resilience and Adaptability\nof the Agrarian and Water Sector Climate Change\nin Guinea-Bissau” carried out the cost-benefit\nanalysis of adaptation in the Gabu region,\nconsidering the reference development trend. In\nthis context it has been shown that Guinea-Bissau is\nnot in itself able to financially support climate\nchange adaptation efforts. Initiatives that may exist\nwill most likely be through international programs\nand the efforts of some NGOs. Alternatively, the\ncountry should strengthen its capacity at national\nand local levels to plan and implement measures to\nincrease\nthe\nresilience\nof\nits\ncommunities,\nequipment and ecosystems to climate change. This\nwill be done within the framework of a climate\nchange\nresilience\nprogram,\nintegrated\ninto\nmultisectoral rural development and based on upto-date and accurate data and forecasts.\nAt national level, government agencies should\nassume a coherent leadership role within a strong\nlegislative and policy framework. The national\ngovernment should make an additional effort to\neffectively allocate human and financial resources\nto overall environmental management for climate\nresilience. The national government should be able\nto use greater capacity to absorb and attract new\nand\nadditional\nclimate-related\ninternational\nfunding. National administrative and technical\nagencies,\nin\npartnership\nwith\ninternational\ncooperation\nagencies\nand\ncivil\nsociety\norganizations, can provide timely and accurate\ntechnical support to local governments and\ncommunities. This will be based on enough\nunderstanding of climate change, climate variability\nand its implications through a prioritization process.\n\nAt local level, communities should identify and\nprioritize measures and undertake programs and\nprojects that incorporate captivities into their\nlivelihoods; activities that reduce their vulnerability,\nin particular as regards climate change and climate\nvariability. This will include physical construction\nand the development of protective measures, such\nas good practice in the most vulnerable sectors,\nending with environmentally harmful practices, and\nfurther diversification of environmentally and\nsocially\nsustainable\nlivelihood\nactivities.\nCommunities should also use their increased\nknowledge of climate change to clearly articulate\ntheir demands with local and national government,\nand to secure additional funding for appropriate\nand effective activities\nWith\nregard\nto\nmitigation,\nGuinea-Bissau's\nPredicted and Determined National Contribution\n(INDC, 2015), which underpins the Paris Agreement,\npointed out that, in order to meet the mitigation\nobjective advocated in the AFOLU sector, a global\ninvestment of no less than $ 200 million by 2020\nand $ 500 million between 2020 and 2030 in foreign\naid.\n\nThe country should strongly focus on strengthening\nhuman capacities that have a direct effect on\nimproving decision making and planning for\nintegral management of low carbon development,\nfocusing on the necessary techniques and\ntechnologies - reforestation and conservation of\nforests and power generation systems. from\nrenewable energy (hydroelectric, photovoltaic,\nwind).\nPromoting research and development research,\nregional and international exchanges to improve\nand better apply the knowledge acquired by\nstakeholders would also be a good way for the\ncountry to strengthen its resilience to the adverse\neffects of climate change in general.\nFinally, with the implementation of the projects\nfunded in the Guinea-Bissau Sustainable Energy\nInvestment Plan 2015-2030, the country will be able\nto reach 61% of the target of renewable energy\npenetration in the established national energy\nmatrix (39% hydro and 22% non-renewable).\nagainst the 52% target established by SE4ALL (39%\nhydro and 22% non-hydro renewable).\n\n 82| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 4: Financial, Technology, Capacity Needs and Support\nReceived\n4.8 References and Footnotes\n\n― Fonseca, Miguel (2017) - O sector da água na Guiné-Bissau/Pontes e Parcerias nos Países de Língua Portuguesa,\nMaio de 2017\n― Gov.

A common\nsystem of transparency now applies to all countries. MRV is central to effectively implementing the\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted under the Paris Agreement, which describe\ncountries’ mitigation goals and policies. Measurement is needed to identify emissions trends, determine\nwhere to focus greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts, track mitigation-related support, assess whether\nmitigation actions planned under NDCs or otherwise are proving effective, evaluate the impact of support\nreceived, and monitor progress achieved in reducing emissions. Reporting and verification are important\nfor ensuring transparency, good governance, accountability, and credibility of results, and for building\nconfidence that resources are being utilized effectively.\nPecixe Island – Guinea Bissau\nhttps://kalmasoul.com/kalma-blog/pecixe-um-paraiso-remoto/\n\n86 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\n\n5.2 MRV Concepts and Definitions\nMany countries have engaged in MRV to serve a\nvariety of domestic and international purposes. This\nterm is widely used in the climate change field, but\noften without a clear reference to the type of MRV\nbeing discussed. This often leads to confusion\nbecause the underlying nature of MRV-related\nactivities differs according to their context and\napplication (Singh, N., J et al., 2016).\n\nBOX 1 | Measurement, Reporting, and Verification of\nNationally (MRV) Determined Contributions - Concept and\nDefinitions\n\nThe term MRV first appeared in the context of\nclimate change mitigation policy as part of the Bali\nAction Plan (2007), which called for “measurable,\nreportable, and verifiable nationally appropriate\nmitigation commitments or actions” and stated that\nthey should be “supported and enabled by\ntechnology, financing and capacity-building, in a\nmeasurable, reportable and verifiable manner”\n(UNFCCC 2007). Subsequently, efforts have been\nmade to fill in the details and define what should be\nmeasured, reported, and verified, how, by whom,\nand for what purpose. Most recently, under the\nParis Agreement, it was agreed that all countries will\nprovide emissions data and track progress against\ntheir contributions. MRV systems will be a\nsignificant component in effectively tracking and\nimproving the implementation of mitigation goals\nand policies articulated under countries’ Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (NDCs) (CDKN Global\n2016).\n\n5.2.1 MRV in Guinea-Bissau\nEven before the term MRV emerged under the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC), some form of monitoring and\nevaluation (M&E) was routinely been used by\ngovernment institutions and other agencies to\naccurately and transparently assess their actions\nand goals within the government legislation\nframework. However, in the context of GHG the\nprocess of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) follows\na given classification and depends on objective\n(emission, mitigation actions or support) so that the\nM&E for mitigation can be named MRV (see Box 1\nfor details) and categorized into three types (Pang\net al. 2014) (Figure 1).\n\nMRV of GHG emissions refers to estimating,\nreporting, and verifying actual emissions over a\ndefined period of time. This type of MRV can be\nperformed at national level, or by organizations and\nfacilities. For example, national GHG inventories\ninclude an account of emissions from a country for\na particular period, are reported to UNFCCC, and\nundergo some form of review.\nMRV of mitigation actions involves assessing (ex-\nante or ex-post) GHG emissions reductions and/or\nsustainable development (non-GHG) effects of\npolicies, projects, and actions, as well as monitoring\ntheir implementation progress. It also involves\nassessing progress toward mitigation goals. An\nexample would be a national government\nestimating the GHG and job growth-related\nimpacts of its home insulation subsidy program.\nWhile MRV of GHG emissions measures actual\nemissions, MRV of mitigation actions estimates the\nchange in emissions and other non-GHG variables\nthat results from those actions.\nMRV of support focuses on monitoring the\nprovision and receipt of financial flows, technical\n\n87 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\n\nknowledge, and capacity building, and evaluating\nthe results and impact of support. An example of\nthis kind of MRV would be developing countries\ntracking climate- specific finance received through\nbilateral or multi- lateral channels.\n\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau, through its\nvarious\ninstitutions\nand\nagencies,\nregularly\nconducts surveys and censuses to complement\nusual data collection, especially in areas covered by\nregular organizational activities. This type of\nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) is usually\nperformed according to the resources and skills\navailable to the government and its institutions,\ntaking into account the financial, technical and\ntechnological aspects, including availability of\nfunds, level of knowledge, appropriate staffing and\ntechnologies such as the necessary hardware and\nsoftware. Unfortunately, data for compiling GHG\ninventories is not traditionally part of the\ngovernment's M&E system and that is why such\nM&E processes, that is MRV have not yet been fully\ninstalled to establish systematic procedures for the\nperiodic compilation of GHG inventories. However,\ndespite these constraints, the country adhered to\nthe international agenda and Guinea-Bissau signed\nand ratified the UNFCCC, thus becoming a\ncontracting party\n.\n\nFigure 5.1 – The MRV categories of mitigation into three types. Adapted from: Singh, N., J et al., 2016\n\n5.3 Information on Domestic MRV\n5.3.1 Development of MRV in Guinea-Bissau\nAccording to the past GHG inventories (2006), the main GHG emission sectors identified were: (i) Land Use\nChange and forest use; (ii) Energy and (iii) Waste. In order to adopt the country's emission reduction\nstrategy, the UNDP financed in 2011 a consultation work aimed at identifying barriers, gaps and capacity\nneeds at the level of Institutional, human and systemic for a successful formulation of development Strategy\nfor Low Carbon Emission (LEDS), NAMAS and MRV system. The identified gaps and barriers regarding the\nimplementation of the MRV, LEDS and NAMAS initiatives in the country were at five levels: human\nresources, material, technical, financial and institutionally in which a coordinate structure is required.\n\nAt the human resources level\nThe following points stand out:\n• Poor development of climate change education,\ntraining and research, in particular as regards\nvulnerability,\nadaptation\n/\nmitigation\nand\ntechnology transfer;\n• Lack\nof\nmastery\nof\ninstruments\nand\nmethodologies for inventorying GHG, adequately\nassessing",

NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East, and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\na variety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative areas\nor governorates. The governorates are subdivided\ninto districts and sub-districts, and within each\ngovernorate there are several municipalities.\nIn order to organise the environmental and\nclimate change institutional set up, the Ministry\nof Environment was established in 2003 to\noversee all environmental affairs. Since then,\nJordan has undergone a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. Based on the\nrecommendations of this policy, the Ministry of\nEnvironment revised the Environment Protection\nLaw, no.52 of 2006 to include and strengthen the\narticles of the law related to climate change. The\nnew Environment Protection Law no.6 of year\n2017, includes provisions on climate change goals\nwhich later enabled the Ministry to develop the\nClimate Change Bylaw no.79, 2019 which aims\nmainly to regulate the coordination of national\nefforts among relevant stakeholders to implement\nmitigation and adaptation measures.\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural\nresources, a high population growth rate, the\nongoing regional conflicts, the rising cost of health\ncare and the growing expectations of people, have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable\nsocial and economic development.\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy. The Ministry\nof Energy and Mineral Resources has recently\npublished the National Energy Sector Strategy for\n2020-2030. This ten-year plan which aims at setting\nthe roadmap to increase self-sufficiency through\nutilization of domestic natural and renewable\nresources, as well as expansion of existing energy\ndevelopments, thus reducing reliance on costly\nforeign fuel imports that burden its economy.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy identified\nrenewable energy usage alongside other sources\nas follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share,\nfollowed by household, industrial and other\nservice sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share\nrespectively.\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable water\nresources. While Jordan’s population is expected to\nincrease as a result of natural population growth,\nthe country has also experienced population\ngrowth due to the influx of multiple waves of\nrefugees putting additional strain on Jordan’s\nalready severely limited water resources.\n\n3\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot, and\ndry summers and short, cool winters. The climate\nis influenced by the country’s location between\nthe aridity of the Arabian Desert and the humidity\nof the eastern Mediterranean area. January is\nthe coldest month, with average temperatures\nranging from 5°C to 10°C, while August is the\nhottest month with average temperatures ranging\nfrom 20°C to 35°C. Rainfall varies from season to\nseason and from year to year. However, about\n75% of the country can be described as having a\ndesert climate with less than 200 millimeters of\nrain annually. About 70% of the average rainfall in\nthe country falls between November and March,\nwhile the period from June to August is often\nwithout rain. However during the last ten years,\nJordan has been witnessing variations in seasons\nand average temperatures.\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions: the Highlands and Marginal\nSteppes where most of the rain-fed farming is\npracticed, the eastern desert (the badia) and the\nlowlands (Jordan Valley).\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. The\nvast majority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, Pine and Juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners, and are found mostly in\nthe northern part of Jordan where higher rainfall\nprevails. These include natural forest vegetation\nand tree plantations on farms, in the form of\nwindbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\nTransportation infrastructure in Jordan is\nconsidered to be relatively well developed within\nthe Middle East. The estimated annual growth in\ndemand for transportation and logistics ranges\nfrom 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s transportation\nand logistics sector plays a key role in Jordan’s\neconomy and contributes over 8.2% of GDP.\nLand and air transportation infrastructure is\nwell developed, with plans to improve maritime\nand railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages. Currently,\ntransportation is considered to be very energy\ninefficient, using almost half of the final energy\nconsumption of Jordan.\nJordan experiences a relatively high growth rate\nin private cars of approximately 5% per year which\nexceeds the estimated population growth. Public\ntransport (PT) in general is not well organized and\nlacks the infrastructure and interchanges required\nfor a comfortable journey. There are few mode\nchoices for PT, compared to other countries, and\nthis has led to its low share of trips. The majority of\ntrips in Jordan are made by private car. There has\nbeen some growth in the numbers of hybrid and\nelectric cars. However, in 2018, hybrid and electric\ncars still made up less than a quarter of the private\ncars in Jordan. A low share of trips are also carried\nout using regular taxis. A new innovation is the\nuse of ride-hailing apps. Their effect on mobility\nhas yet to be studied in Jordan.\n\n4\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhas improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of municipal solid waste (MSW) over\ntime. Preliminary official estimates refer to more\nthan 20-35% increase in solid waste generation\nin Jordan following the Syrian crisis, putting a\nsubstantial burden on municipalities as well as\non the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste is collected from 100 municipalities and\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km to\nthe East of Amman over an area of 2,000 Dunums,\nenough to dispose waste until 2035. In 1989, the\nGovernment of Jordan selected Swaqa landfill,\n125 km to the South-East of Amman, as a facility\nto process hazardous waste.\n2. NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for\nthe year 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines\nand the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines. The estimation of the overall national\ninventory was carried out using the 2006 IPCC\nInventory Software for non-Annex I Parties. The\nsectors and subsectors that were considered are\nthe Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use\n(IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU) and Waste.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nin units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by source and removal by sink. Indirect\nGHGs were estimated, whenever the activity data\nwere available, using the EEA Guidelines and\nmethodology.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC SAR were used.\nThe overall GHG Inventory estimates for Jordan in\n2016 were 31,063.32 Gg of CO2-equivalent (CO2eq).\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the energy sector was\nthe major emitter releasing around 76% of total\nnational emissions followed by the waste sector\nwith a contribution of around 12%.\n Energy sector\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016. Fugitive\nemissions (from oil and natural gas) were\nnegligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with a share of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture) accounted each for 10% and 10 % of\nthe total respectively.\n\n5\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n Industrial processes and product use\n(IPPU) sector\nEmissions from the industrial processes sector\nwere 3,177.42 Gg of CO2eq accounting for\n10% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016.\nThe industrial processes sector was a source of\nNMVOCs emissions and accounted for 32.61 Gg in\n2016. In addition to CO2 and NMVOCs, the sector\ngenerated emissions of HFCs with 757.29 Gg of\nCO2eq in 2016.\n Agriculture, forestry and other land use\nchange sector\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016. The emissions were\ncomposed of methane and nitrous oxide and were\ngenerated by various subcategories.\n Waste sector\nGHG emissions from the waste sector reached\n3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for 12% of\nJordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3,559.01 Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions in\n2016, while wastewater handling accounted for\n5% (188.40Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\n GHG Inventory by gas\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nresulted from the energy sector accounting\nfor 95% followed by 9% from the IPPU sector.\nMethane emissions were highest from the\nwaste sector followed by the AFOLU sector with\ncontributions of 70% and 17%, respectively.\nNitrous oxide emissions were highest from the\nAFOLU sector with 57%, followed by the IPPU,\nenergy and waste sectors, with contributions of\n18%, 13% and 12%, respectively. As expected, the\nIPPU sector contributed 100% of HFCs while the\nNMVOCs emissions resulted from the IPPU and\nthe energy sectors.\nWithin the energy sector, the main emissions\nwere in the form of CO2 (97%). Within the IPPU\nsector, the key GHGs were CO2 followed by HFCs\nwith shares of 69% and 24%, respectively. Nitrous\noxide emissions were highest from the AFOLU\nsector, with around 57% mainly from fertilizers\nand manure management. Methane emissions\nwere highest from the waste sector, with 78% and\nproduced from solid waste management.\nGHG emissions (+) and removals (-) in Gg CO2eq by Gas and by Sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\nCH4\nN2O\nHFCs\nSF6\n(Gg)\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nTotal national\nemissions and\nremovals\n24,385.37\n4,675.49\n1,245.14\n757.29\n0.022\nEnergy\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\nNA\nNO\nIPPU\n2,194.88\n0.00\n225.22\n757.29\n0.022\nAFOLU\n-896.76\n614.62\n710.85\nNA, NO\nNO\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\nNA\nNO\n\n6\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n3. GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nUpdate of the FBUR baseline scenario: the\nbaseline scenario was updated for all economic\nsectors of energy, industry, agriculture and forestry\nin addition to the waste sector, based on the\nstrategies, policies and plans prevailing in the\nJordanian context during the time of preparation\nof this SBUR (2020). This requires a projection\nof the current levels to future levels for each\ntype of activity. The newly released strategies,\npolicies, action plans and committed projects\nwere reviewed and summarized. In addition,\nall projects and actions that were part of FBUR\nbaseline scenario were reviewed to update their\nstatus. Based on this review, the most probable\nfuture trends in activities that will impact and\nshape the GHG emissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n Jordan 2025, Vision and National Strategy,\nissued in May 2015.\n The new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n The\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August 2020,\n The new Solid Waste Management Framework\nLaw issued in March 2020 and entered into\nforce in September 2020,\n National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020), issued\nin 2018,\n Jordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in\n2016.\nUpdate of FBUR GHG mitigation measures: All\nmitigation projects were reviewed and assessed\nto identify all those still valid. These projects\nstill considered valid have been updated after\nadjustments were made to their expected\nimplementation timeline. The emission reduction\nand the unit cost of emission reduction for each\nmitigation project have been recalculated taking\ninto consideration several factors, such as the\nimprovement in technologies and changes in\nprices. Net present value was used in the financial\ncalculations, by converting all present and future\nrevenues and costs over the project’s lifetime to\na base of today’s cost. The same approach was\nfollowed in calculating the CO2eq emissions\nreduction over the lifetime of the mitigation\nprojects. A discount cost of 8% was used for both\nthe cost and emission reduction calculations. Also,\nthe discounted unit cost of reduced emission\nreduction was calculated as the quotient of the\ndiscounted cost in JD to the discounted emissions\nin tonnes of CO2.\nThe update of FBUR mitigation projects resulted in\n23 valid GHG mitigation projects identified within\nthe primary energy, renewable energy, energy\nefficiency, industry, domestic solid waste and\nwastewater, and agriculture and forestry sectors\nand subsectors. Emission reduction in addition\nto the abatement cost have been recalculated for\neach proposed mitigation project.\nIt was concluded from the abatement cost analysis\nfor the valid projects from the FBUR that the\nmost feasible options are the energy mitigation\nprojects. The findings indicated that in particular\nthe projects related to energy efficiency should\nreceive the most attention. The table below shows\nthe marginal abatement cost for all mitigation\nmeasures ranked from the highest to the lowest.\n\n7\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNo.\nProject Name\nEmissions Reduction\nUnit Cost (JD/tonne\nof CO2eq)\n1\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 1)\n118.68\n2\nForestry - Introduction of new plantations in Urban Areas\n40.00\n3\nRangeland 1- Restoration of Rangeland Areas\n18.00\n4\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Northern Area\n14.50\n5\nRangeland 2- New Protected Rangeland Area as Natural Reserve\n10.00\n6\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Madaba\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.54\n7\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Baqa’a\ntertiary domestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.48\n8\nCatalytic Reduction of N2O inside the Ammonia Burner of the Nitric\nAcid Plant\n0.37\n9\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil domestic solid\nwaste landfill\n-0.50\n10\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Wadi\nArab domestic wastewater treatment plant\n-4.00\n11\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 2)\n-7.18\n12\nNatural gas distribution network in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\n-13.78\n13\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw materials\nneeded to produce clinker\n-22.90\n14\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45% of Pozzolana\n-32.00\n15\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\n-32.10\n16\nUse of biomass (domestic solid waste or/and sewage sludge) as\nalternative fuels in cement plants\n-69.30\n17\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water tanks in food\nindustry\n-108.04\n18\nLoss reduction in transmission and distribution\n-108.52\n19\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional burners in the\nsteel industry\n-110.03\n20\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 houses\n-183.64\n21\nSolar water heaters 3 - 30,000 houses\n-189.95\n22\nInsulating pipes, fittings and tanks in food industries\n-215.16\n23\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices in the Jordan valley\n-1333.00\nMarginal abatement cost for all mitigation measures (ranked from the highest to the lowest)\n\n8\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n4. DOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING,\nAND VERIFICATION\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its market readiness proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\nProposal (PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined\na plan for implementing the market readiness\ncomponents that will be necessary to support\nthe development of appropriate market based\ninstruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n A National MRV system and registry for climate\nmitigation measures,\n Designing a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n Exploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith the development of a multi-tiered integrated\nMRV system. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE). Adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors will serve in tracking progress\ntowards NDC commitments.\n5. UPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND\nRELATED NEEDS\nThe following are some recommendations for\nthe successful implementation of the climate\nchange bylaw no 79/2019, through support of\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to this bylaw:\n It is recommended that the MoEnv as chair\nof the NCCC clarify and continually stress the\nrole of different ministries and institutions in\nthe area of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n Seek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe, committee and the technical groups,\nformed according to the climate change bylaw,\nin areas relevant to their roles,\n It is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at least\n3 years) to be able to strengthen their work\nand it’s highly recommended to prepare their\nsuccessors in advance,\n Climate change directorates at different\nministries and institutions are important\nvehicles to mainstream climate change into\nthe strategies and policies of their respective\ninstitutions. As such, it is recommended that\nthe MoEnv coordinates continuously with these\ndepartments and supports them in identifying\ntheir capacity building needs.\nJordan’s FBUR to the UNFCCC was prepared and\nsubmitted in late 2017. After its submission, a\nTeam of Technical Experts (TTE) was tasked with\nits review. These experts were trained to conduct\nreviews as part of the ICA according to Decision\n2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s FBUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify the capacity-building\nneeds of developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NC’s:\n\n9\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series,\nb. Develop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources,\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis,\nd. Develop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and emission\nfactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis,\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct ongoing\nsurveys to provide accurate data and to\nintegrate climate change questions in existing\nenergy surveys that mainly focus on energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng. Enhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh. Enhance technical capacity to report on mitigation\nactions that are already implemented or\nongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress and the\nunderlying steps envisaged for the planned\nmitigation actions and when they will be\nimplemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\nIn terms of financial resources needs; the key\nchallenges in financing climate change projects\nare summarized as follows:\n Due to the Corona pandemic and its negative\neffects on health, the economy and society, it\nis expected that financial support from donors\nwill be directed to the health sector to mitigate\nthe effects of this pandemic, and this may\nnegatively affect the availability of the required\nsupport from international bodies or public\nbudgets at the national level to implement\nprojects to protect the environment in general\nand climate change projects in particular,\n Lack of climate finance framework (policy or\nstrategy),\n Banks in Jordan, in general, are interested\nin providing finance to renewable energy\nand energy efficiency projects. Banks prefer\nfinancing RE projects, particularly those which\nare of a larger size and linked to their existing\nclient base. EE and smaller sized projects are\nless preferred,\n To minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n There is a lack of appropriate financial products,\n Project developers lack technical capacity.\n\n10\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps and\nneeds:\n Expansion of the framework for the MRV system\nfor received support that addresses most of\nthe above gaps, constraints, and needs by\nestablishing a dedicated entity to oversee\ncollecting and verifying received support\ninformation related to climate change,\n Strengthen the ability to develop bankable and\nevidence-based projects,\n It is recommended to raise the capacities of\nstakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects,\n It is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment,\n Enhance the partnership between the public\nand private sector.\n \n\n11\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRoman Theater\n\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1\n1.1\nLocation and Climate\n14\n1.2\nGovernance Structure\n15\n1.3\nThe Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n15\n1.4\nSocial Indicators\n16\n1.5\nEconomic Context\n18\n1.6\nEnergy Profile\n19\n1.7\nWater Resources\n22\n1.8\nAgriculture and Forestry\n25\n1.9\nTransportation\n26\n1.10 Industry\n31\n1.11 Waste Management\n31\nReferences\n33\n\n14\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThis\nchapter\ndescribes\nJordan’s\nnational\ncircumstances that are related directly and\nindirectly to climate change.\nThe following sections will be covered:\n Location and Climate\n Governance Structure\n The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n Social Indicators\n Economical Context\n Energy Profile\n Water Resources\n Agriculture and Forestry\n Transportation\n Industry\n Waste Management\n1.1 Location and Climate\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\nvariety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot,\nand dry summers and short, cool winters. The\nclimate is influenced by the country’s location\nbetween the aridity of the Arabian Desert and\nthe humidity of the eastern Mediterranean area.\nJanuary is the coldest month, with average\ntemperatures ranging from 5°C to 10°C, while\nAugust is the hottest month with average\ntemperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C.  Rainfall\nvaries from season to season and from year to\nyear. However, about 75% of the country can be\ndescribed as having a desert climate with less than\n200 millimeters of rain annually. About 70% of\nthe average rainfall in the country falls between\nNovember and March, while June through August\nare often rainless. However during the last ten\nyears, Jordan has been witnessing changes in\nseasons and average temperatures.\nJordan can be divided into three main geographic\nand climatic areas: the Jordan Valley, the Mountain\nHeights Plateau, and the Eastern Desert, or Badia\nregion. The Jordan Valley has the country’s most\ndistinctive natural terrain. The northern segment\nof the Jordan Valley, known in Arabic as the\nGhor, is the most fertile region. Several degrees\nwarmer than the rest of the country, its year-round\nagricultural climate, fertile soils, higher winter\nrainfall, and extensive summer irrigation have\nmade the Ghor the food basket of Jordan. The\nJordan Valley is the location of the Jordan River\nwhich extends from the northern border down\nto the Dead Sea.\nThe Mountain Heights Plateau is the highlands\nof Jordan. It extends through the entire length\nof the western part of the country and separates\nthe Jordan Valley and its margins from the plains\nof the eastern desert. These areas receive Jordan’s\nhighest rainfall, and are the most richly vegetated\nin the country. This region hosts most of Jordan’s\npopulation centres, including the cities of Amman,\nMadaba, Zarqa, Irbid, and Karak.\nThe Eastern Desert or Badia Region comprises\naround 75% of Jordan. This area of desert and\ndesert steppe is part of what is known as the\nNorth Arab Desert. It stretches into Syria, Iraq, and\nSaudi Arabia, with elevations varying between 600\nand 900 meters above sea level. Climate in the\nBadia varies widely between day and night, and\nbetween summer and winter. Daytime summer\ntemperatures can exceed 40°C, while winter\nnights can be very cold, dry, and windy. Rainfall is\nminimal throughout the year, averaging less than\n50 millimeters annually. Although the regions of\nthe Badia (or desert) have common harsh desert\nclimate, similar vegetation, and sparse population\nconcentrations, those regions vary considerably\naccording to their geology.\n\n15\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.2 Governance Structure\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a\nconstitutional monarchy with a representative\ngovernment. Jordan is divided into twelve\nadministrative areas or Governorates (Figure\n1.1). Each Governorate is managed by a Governor\nwho is designated by the Cabinet based on the\nrecommendation of the Minister of Interior.\nFigure 1.1: The twelve governorates of Jordan.\nThe Governorates are subdivided into districts, subdistricts, and chief towns and these are managed by\ncivil servants of the Ministry of Interior, whose task\nis to coordinate and supervise the decentralized\nservices of other ministries under the authority\nof the Governor. Within governorates there are\nseveral municipalities, the Law of 1955 defines the\nMunicipality as being “A financially independent\nnational institution”, having a “legal personality”\nand an administrative autonomy, which is managed\nby the town council that is composed of the Mayor\nand 6 to 11 councilors.\n1.3 The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\nThe Ministry of Environment was established\nin 2003 to oversee all environmental affairs.\nSince then the country has witnessed a steady\nexpansion of the legal and institutional framework\nfor environmental protection. The Ministry of\nEnvironment became the focal point for all\ninternational environmental conventions including\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC).\nJordan is undergoing a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. The policy\nprovides guidance to sector strategies from a\n\n16\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTable 1.1: Social indicators\nclimate change perspective, and it provides a\nframework for coordination of climate change\nactivities at the national level.\nBased on the recommendations of this policy, the\nMinistry of Environment revised the Environment\nProtection Law, no.52 of 2006 to add new articles\nrelated to climate change and strengthen the\nexisting articles. The new Environment Protection\nLaw no.6 of year 2017, includes provisions on\nclimate change goals which later enabled the\nministry to develop the climate change bylaw\nno.79, 2019.\nThe climate change bylaw aims to regulate;\n(a) the coordination of national efforts among\nrelevant stakeholders to implement mitigation\nand adaptation measures, (b) the development\nof a legislative framework that maps out plans to\ncombat climate change in the Kingdom and ways\nto implement them, (c) the streaming of climate\nchange into national plans and the implementation\nof the goals and principles of the UNFCCC and the\nParis Agreement. According to the bylaw, a highlevel committee is established under the name\n“National Committee on Climate Change” which\nis chaired by the Minister of Environment and\nconsists of 16 high-level members from relevant\npublic authorities. Its functions and powers are\nidentified within the bylaw including the power\nto form technical teams from governmental and\nnon-governmental agencies represented by\ncivil society institutions, research institutions,\nuniversities and the private sector institutions.\nThe teams are mainly tasked with supporting the\nMoEnv with the NDC, the national adaptation plan\nand any other reports that should be prepared\nwithin Jordan’s international commitments and\nassessing the capacity-building needs of relevant\nentities related to climate change and contributing\nto the implementation of awareness-raising and\ncapacity-building activities.\n1.4 Social Indicators\nThe following table summarizes the main\nsocial indicators in Jordan; including the main\ndemographic data for the Jordanian population,\nrefugees and education and health indicators.\nPopulation (end of year 2019)\n10,554,000\nMale\n5,588,000\nFemale\n4,966,000\nUrban ( 90.3% )\n9,529.200\nRural ( 9.7% )\n1,024,800\nAge less than 14 years\n34.4 %\nAge between (20-45) years\n39 %\nPopulation Growth Rate\nFor years (1952- 1979)\n4.8%\nFor years (1994-2004)\n2.6%\nFor years (2004-2015)\n5.3%\n\n17\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe average household income (DOS, 2017 and 2018)\n11,242 JD\nAverage annual income for female-headed households\n9,534 JD\nAverage annual income for male-headed households\n11,519 JD\nThe gender pay gap\n17%\nThe female participation in the Jordanian labor market (World Bank,\n2020)\n15%\nHouseholds Headed by Female (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (agricultural land)\n44%\nOwn livestock\n30%\nHouseholds Headed by Male (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (Agricultural land)\n68%\nOwn livestock\n36%\nRefugees (registered as refugees) to End of Year 2019\n755,050\nRoughly Annual Cost providing for refugees (JRP, 2018)\n2.9 Billion JD = 8% of GDP\nParticipation from International Community (%) (JRP, 2018)\n5.5%\nSyrian refugees (UNHCR,2019)\n664,226\nIn urban areas\n80%\nIn (Al Za,Atari, Mrajeeb Al-farhood, Cyper City and Al-Azraq ) Camps\n20%\nEducation in Jordan (DOS,2017)\nIlliteracy rate for those above 15 years old (DOS,2017)\n5.1%\nExpenditures on education (% of GDP)\n3.6%\nHealth Indicators\nTotal annual expenditure per capita (WHO,2014)\n798 USD\nExpenditures (% of GDP) (WHO,2014)\n7.5%\nLife expectancy (DOS,2017)\n73.5\nInfant mortality rate per 1000 capita (UN, 2019)\n14\nCrude birth rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n21.5\nCrude death rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n3.9\nSource: DOS, 2019 unless otherwise indicated\n\n18\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe national accounts statistics published in 2019\nby the Central Bank of Jordan and the Department\nof Statistics (DOS) showed that there was an\nimprovement in GDP per capita at existing prices\nin 2018 while the GDP growth rate decreased.\nTable 1.3 shows the national statistics and the\npercentage of the main contributing sectors to\nGDP along the last five years (2014-2018).\n1.5 Economic Context\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural resources,\na high population growth rate, the ongoing\nregional conflicts, the rising cost of health care,\nand the growing expectations of people have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable social\nand economic development. Jordan’s economic\nindicators are illustrated in Table 1.2.\nTable 1.2: Economic indicators\nGeneral Socio-Economic Indicators for 2018\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices\n30,482 Million JD\nGDP at constant prices\n29,474 Million JD\nAnnual Growth Rates of GDP at Current Prices\n3.7%\nAnnual Growth Rates of GDP at constant Prices\n1.9%\nCompensation Annual Growth Rates of employees as a percentage of GDP\n39.0%\nGovernment final consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP at\ncurrent prices\n17.1 %\nGross Fixed Capital formation out of GDP at current prices\n20.4%\nExport of goods and services out of GDP at current prices\n35.1%\nImports of goods and services out of GDP at current prices\n53.0 %\nLabor Market Indicators for 2018 (MoL,2018)\nLabor Force (persons above the age of 15)\n1,734,248\nMales Economically Active\n56.4%\nFemales Economically Active\n15.4%\nUnemployed Males\n16.5%\nUnemployed Females\n26.8%\n\n19\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTable 1.3: National accounts statistics\nIndictors\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nGDP at Current Market Prices (million JD)\n(2016=100)\n25,595.8\n26,925.1\n27,829.6\n28,903.4\n29,984.2\nGDP at Constant Market Prices (million JD)\n(2016=100)\n26,579.7\n27,265.4\n27,829.6\n28,418.4\n28,969.8\nGDP Growth Rate at Current Market Prices (%)\n7.2\n5.2\n3.4\n3.9\n3.7\nGDP Growth Rate at Constant Market Prices (%)\n3.4\n2.6\n2.1\n2.1\n1.9\nEconomic Activity contribution (%) to GDP\nManufacturing\n16.7\n16.5\n16.4\n16.2\n17.9\nWholesale and Retail Trade, Restaurants, and\nHotels\n10.1\n9.9\n9.9\n9.8\n9.4\nTransport, Storage, and Communications\n14.4\n14.5\n14.7\n14.8\n16.5\nFinance, Insurance, and Business Services\n9.7\n9.9\n8\n8.1\n8.4\nAll categories of the 2017 budget, including\ndomestic revenues, foreign grants, current\nexpenditure, and capital expenditure, showed a\ndecline compared with the year before. The sharp\ndrop in foreign grants from 700 million JD in 2018\ncompared to 1,236.5 million JD in 2014, came as a\nshock, as Jordan depends heavily on foreign grants\nto finance its capital expenditure. The consolidated\nbudget deficit for the central government and\ngovernment owned units reached 694.8 million\nJD in 2017, compared to 825.9 million JD within\nthe same period of 2016.\nOutstanding external public debt (government\nand government guaranteed) decreased by\n2.6% to reach 11,560 million JD at the end of the\nsecond quarter of the year 2018, which represents\na decrease in the percentage to GDP from 41.7% at\nthe end of 2017 to 39.8% by the end of the second\nquarter of 2018. (MOF, 2018).\nIn contrast, net domestic debt balance increased\nby 10.6% reaching 15,005 million JD in the same\nperiod, net domestic debt as percent of GDP was\n51.6 % by the end of the second quarter of 2018\ncompared to 47.7% of GDP at the end of 2017.\nThe increase of net domestic debt was a result of\nincreasing net outstanding budgetary debt by\n1,359 million JD and increasing net outstanding\ndebt of NEPCO and WAJ by 77 million JD.\n\nThe net outstanding public debt increased by 4.4%\nfrom its level at the end of 2017, reaching about\n26,564 million JD, and representing 91.4% of the\nestimated GDP for 2018.\n1.6 Energy Profile\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy (MEMR, 2019).\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\n\n20\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe Strategy, which assumes 2018 as base year, predicts the changes in contribution of different energy\nsources in electricity generation between 2020 and 2030 as illustrated in the following charts.\nFigure 1.2: The National Energy Strategy (2020-2030) forecast for electricity generation\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the nationally\ndetermined contributions (NDCs) target by 2030.\nThe total renewable capacity by the end of 2018\nwas 1,130 MW and expected to reach 2,400 MW\nby the end of 2020, accounting for 20% of the\ngenerated electricity, compared to 1% in 2014\n(MEMR, 2018).\nIn 2014, a legislative and regulatory framework for\nrenewable energy has been set up by enacting a\nspecial renewable energy law as well as developing\nthe needed bylaws and instructions, which promote\nrenewable energy through financial incentives. As\na result, many renewable energy power purchase\nagreements were signed to supply the grid with\nelectricity generated from solar and wind. Many of\nthese projects became operational in 2015.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share followed\nby household, industrial and other services sectors\nwith 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share respectively.\nFigure (1.3) shows the final energy consumption\nin Jordan by sector for the year 2018.\n\n21\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe interruption of the Egyptian gas supply forced\nthe Jordanian government to look for new sources\nof natural gas. The construction of a Liquefied\nNatural Gas (LNG) jetty project at Aqaba port,\nthe connection to the Arab gas pipeline, and the\nleasing of a Floating Storage and Regasification\nUnit (FSRU) were successfully implemented and\nput into commercial operation in September\n2015. In 2018, 88.8% of electricity generated in\nthe Kingdom was based on imported natural\ngas. Eventually, Jordan will develop the ability to\nmeet all its needs for natural gas: for electricity\ngeneration and for industrial use.\nJordan possesses one of the largest oil shale\nreserves in\nthe\nworld with total\ndeposits\nestimated at 70 billion tonnes, containing more\nthan seven billion tonnes of oils. It is planned\nthat by 2020, 470 MW of electric generating\ncapacity will be under operation from the Attarat\nOil shale project signed in 2014 (MEMR, 2018).\nThe Attarat Power Plant is an oil shale-fueled\npower plant under construction in the Attarat\nUm Ghudran area, 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of\nAl Qatranah in Jordan.\nThis project is being developed by the Attarat\nPower Company (APCO) (which is a partnership\nbetween YTL Power International (45%), Guangdong\nYudean Group (45%) and Eesti Energia (%10)),\nto be the first oil shale fired power station and\nopen cast mine to commercially utilize Jordan’s oil\nshale. APCO has entered into a -30 year agreement\nwith NEPCO for the sale of the entire electrical\ncapacity and net electrical output following\nconstruction of the power station. The power\nplant will have 554 MW gross and 477 MW net\ncapacity and it will consist of two circulatingfluidized-bed units. It is expected to meet 10-15%\nof Jordan´s annual power demand. \nAdditionally, Jordan has developed a strategy for\nutilizing nuclear power to supply the country with\n30% of its demand for electricity by 2030, with\nsurplus destined for export. A nuclear power\ncommittee was set up in 2007 and a law was\nenacted to establish the Jordan Atomic Energy\nCommission (JAEC) and the Jordan Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (JNRC). In December\n2016, JAEC in cooperation with a consortium\nheaded by the Korean Atomic Energy Research\nFigure 1.3: Energy consumption per sector, 2018\n\n* Others: Commercial and agricultural sectors along with streetlight. Source: MEMR, 2019\n*\n\n22\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nInstitute inaugurated the 5 MW Jordan Research\nand Training Reactor. The facility is the first nuclear\nreactor in the county. It will provide radioactive\nisotopes for medical applications in Jordan, and\nwill provide training for students at the Jordan\nUniversity of Science and Technology to prepare\na skilled workforce for the country’s planned\ncommercial nuclear power reactors.\nThe country was aiming to have two 1,000 MW\nnuclear power units in operation by 2025, by the\nRosatom Company, but is now considering the use\nof small modular reactors (SMRs) instead which\nseems to be the more appropriate in bridging the\ngap in the Jordanian electricity generation mix.\n1.7 Water Resources\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable\nwater resources (MWI, 2017). While Jordan’s\npopulation is expected to increase as a result of\nnatural population growth, the country has also\nexperienced population growth due to the influx\nof multiple waves of refugees putting additional\nstrain on Jordan’s already severely limited water\nresources.\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for Municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses, as indicated by Figure 1.4.\nAccording to 2017 figures, about 46% of the\nagricultural demand is met by groundwater\nresources and the rest is met by surface and\ntreated water, as shown in Table 1.4 (MWI, 2017).\nThe majority of irrigated land in Jordan is located\nFigure 1.4: Water use by sector, 2017\n\n23\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nin the highlands and desert areas (about 52,700\nhectares), and in the Jordan Valley (about 31,600\nhectares).\nAbout 72% of the water supply for domestic uses\nis met by groundwater sources. The potable water\ninfrastructure in Jordan is not very efficient. The\nwater loss was estimated as 48% in 2017 compared\nto 43% in 2010, divided into more than 50% as\nadministrative loss and less than 50% as physical\nloss from the networks. (MWI, 2017)\nAbout 85% of the industrial demand is met by\ngroundwater resources. It is worth noting that\nindustrial water demand is projected to increase,\ndue to anticipated expansion in industrial\nenterprises as a result of Jordan’s inclusion in the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), the free trade\nagreements signed between Jordan and the\nUnited States, and the establishment of free zones\nin different regions of Jordan. These agreements\nmake Jordan a desirable destination for regional\ninvestors and manufacturers.\nWater Source\nSector\nTotal\n (MCM)\nPercentage\nof the total\nDomestic\nIndustrial\nAgriculture\nGroundwater\n338.4\n27.2\n253.2\n618.8\n59 %\nSurface water\n131.3\n2.4\n154.4\n288.1\n27 %\nTreated Wastewater\n0\n2.5\n144.2\n146.7\n14 %\nTotal\n469.7\n32.1\n551.8\n1,053.6\n100 %\nPercentage of the total\n45%\n3%\n52%\n100%\nSource: MWI, 2017\nTable 1.4: Water sources for different sectors\nGroundwater contributes about 59% to the total\nwater supply. Of the twelve major groundwater\nbasins, ten are over-extracted. Increasing overall\nwater extraction to meet national needs carries a\nhigh cost. Jordan is now accessing nonrenewable\nwater resources from fossilized deep-water\naquifers. Underground water from the nonrenewable Disi aquifer (about 100 MCM) is being\nused to meet Jordan’s water supply for domestic\nuse, while treated wastewater (147 MCM) is being\nused mostly to meet the country’s agricultural\nneeds (MWI, 2017). Surface water supplies account\nfor 27% of Jordan’s total water supply estimated\nas 288.1 MCM in 2017.\nJordan’s population was 10.3 million in 2018\nand it is expected to reach 19 million by 2050\nunder business-as-usual scenario (DOS, 2018). The\nproportion of water used for domestic purposes\nmay increase by 50-60% in the same time period.\nBy 2025, water demand will exceed available water\nresources by more than 26%, but this deficit is\nprojected to decline to 6% when the Red SeaDead Sea project is put into operation (MWI, 2016).\nWater shortage in Jordan is a chronic problem and\nwill continue to be so for years to come. If current\ndomestic, agricultural, and industrial water-use\npractices are not improved, the water supply in\nJordan will deplete in quantity and quality over\ntime. Overdraft of groundwater and surface water\nis creating a tremendous stress on the water\nsupply in Jordan. The reduced flow of surface\nwater to the Dead Sea is also a source of concern.\nDespite Jordan’s severe water scarcity, more\nthan 94% of Jordanians have access to safe\ndrinking water and 65% have access to improved\nsanitation. These are some of the highest rates\nin the Middle East and North Africa region.\nHowever, water supply is intermittent, and the\nrooftop tanks have become an integral part of\nthe supply water storage system. Around 50% of\nJordanians are supplied by water once a week\n(24 hours) while the rest are supplied by a higher\nrate (more than 24 hours per week) (MWI, 2017).\nSince the Disi-Amman Conveyor Project became\n\n24\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\noperational in the summer of 2013, the continuity\nof water supply to Amman has improved. However,\npopulation centres in the northern governorates\nhave not benefitted fully because of increased\ndemand driven by the concentration of Syrian\nrefugees in the north. Aqaba has continuous\nwater supply from the Disi Aquifer. It is planned\nto bridge the remaining gap between demand and\nsupply through increased use of non-conventional\nwater including reclaimed water and desalinated\nseawater to be provided by the Red Sea-Dead\nSea project in the near future. The National Water\nStrategy emphasizes desalination as well as treated\nwastewater reuse to meet shortfalls in freshwater\navailability (MWI, 2017).\nThe Jordan National Water Strategy 2016-2025 has\nidentified treated wastewater, when mixed with\nsurface water, as a source of irrigation water. In\n2017, the amount of treated wastewater exceeded\n163 MCM. There are 33 public working wastewater\ntreatment plants in Jordan, most of which use\nactivated sludge. They are either operated by the\nWater Authority of Jordan (WAJ) or managed by\nthe Project Management Unit (PMU) at the Ministry\nof Water and Irrigation (MWI) through contracts\nwith the private sector. The Samra Wastewater\nTreatment Plant (WWTP) receives more than 70%\nof the country’s total generated wastewater.\nAccording to MWI figures, the ratio of industrial\nto total water use in 2017 was very small (5.2%).\nIndustrial wastewater discharged to wadis and\nother surface water bodies was first regulated by\nMartial Law issued in 1981, to force all industries\nto treat their wastewater before discharge to\nreceiving water bodies. A number of industrial\nentities divert their wastewater to the public sewer\nsystem according to WAJ regulation No. 18/1998.\n\n25\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.8 Agriculture and Forestry\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions with various landscape\nclassification (Figure 1.5) among which: the\nhighlands and marginal steppes where most of\nthe rain-fed farming is practiced, the Badia (deserts\nand rangeland; mostly livestock systems and\nsome cultivation in watersheds and from deep\nbore irrigation), and the lowlands (Jordan Valley)\nthat thinly stretches from the North West to the\nSouth West.\nFigure 1.5: Preliminary Landscape classification (Created by Natalia BOULAD, 2019)\n\n26\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. In\naddition, the agro-industrial sector is characterized\nby a large number of small enterprises. The vast\nmajority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables. More than 90%\nof irrigated areas in Jordan are dedicated to the\ncultivation of fruit trees and vegetables.\nTable 1.5: Indicators of agricultural sector\nSocio-economic Indicators for Agriculture in Jordan\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n20%\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 2018 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n6.1%\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n57 Million JD\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n1,687.9 Million\nJD\n% of active employees\n1.7%\nNon-Jordanian workers holding work permits in Agriculture in 2017 (DOS,2017)\n81,691\nNumber of Males\n79,685\nNumber of Females\n2006\nAgricultural product exports are a significant\ncontributor to Jordan’s overall export profile;\nstrong productivity and competitiveness of the\nsector are clearly shown despite its relatively\nsmall contribution of 6.1% to the country’s GDP.\nThe Jordanian agriculture exports represented\napproximately 18% of Jordan’s exports (or US$ 6.2\nbillion) in 2016. Exporting agricultural produce has\nbeen affected by the conflict in Syria, causing a\nsevere decline of around 25% as well as disrupting\noverland exports to other markets (Oxford Business\nGroup, 2015).\nAgriculture is mostly influenced by water\navailability and the ability to use advanced\npractices, technologies, and interventions to adapt\nto the impacts of climate change. Over the past two\ndecades, Jordan has witnessed a drastic drop in\nrainfall and prolonged drought periods. According\nto Jordan’s Third National Communication (TNC)\nreport outcomes, it is projected to witness a\ndecrease in precipitation by 15-60% and a rise\nof 1-4°C in temperatures. These climatic changes\nwill have serious negative consequences on\nnatural ecosystems, river basins, watersheds, and\nbiodiversity.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, pine and juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners and are found mostly\nin the northern part of Jordan where higher\nrainfall is prevailing. They include natural forest\nvegetation and tree plantations on farms, in the\nform of windbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\n1.9 Transportation\nTransportation is a key sector for Jordan, providing\na necessary service to promote economic growth.\nCurrently it is considered to be very energy\ninefficient (ACT Alliance repot, 2018), using\nalmost half of the final energy consumption of\nJordan (MEMR Brochure, 2019). The estimated\nannual growth in demand for transportation and\nlogistics ranges from 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s\n\n27\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\ntransportation and logistics sector plays a key role\nin Jordan’s economy and contributes over 8.2% of\nGDP. (Jordan Investment Commission, 2017). Land,\nmaritime and air transportation infrastructure\nare well developed, and there are plans to\ndevelop railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages.\nToday, there is an extensive 80,000 square kilometers\nroad network which spans across the Kingdom,\nconnecting it with neighboring countries.\nThere is no regular passenger rail in the country.\nThe Hejaz railway which runs the length of the\ncountry from north to south, has not been used for\nmany years and would need extensive renovation,\nto be put back into operation. The service from\nAmman to Syria was halted about 10 years ago,\nand the only passenger railway trips are for ondemand tourist trips travelling from Amman to\nJiza, a short distance to the south of the city.\nThe Kingdom serves as an important regional\ntransport\nhub between\nGulf\nCooperation\nCouncil (GCC) countries and Turkey and Europe,\nand also between Iraq and the Red Sea and\nthe Mediterranean. \nThere are three airports in Jordan: Queen Alia\nInternational Airport (QAIA), the main airport, and\nAmman Civil Airport, both in Amman Governorate\nand King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nThe only scheduled internal flights are passenger\nflights between QAIA and Aqaba.\nThe port city of Aqaba, on the Red Sea, provides\nthe only gateway to shipping for the country and\nis therefore an important centre for freight.\nAdditionally, the transport sector in the inventories\nof 2012 and 2016 was estimated to have\ncontributed to 26% and 28% respectively of the\ngreenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest\nemitter after the energy industries (electricity\ngeneration). The available national inventories,\nshow that the share of emissions for the transport\nsector are rising at an increasing rate, and that\nthe share of emissions within the inventories are\nrising, see table below.\nYear\n2006\n2010\n2012\n2016\nTransport Emissions Gg/CO2\n4,706\n5,297\n7,392\n8,787\n% of National GHG Emissions\n16\n23\n26\n28\nSource: TNC and BURs.\nTable 1.6: Transport GHG emissions from national inventories\nThe majority of trips in Jordan are made by private\ncars as indicated in the modal split in table 1.7. The\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) estimated this to be\n35% of trips for 2010, based on household surveys\nand this was backed up by the household survey\ncarried out in Amman in 2008, which estimated that\n33% of trips were made by private car. It is expected\nthat these percentages will have increased since\nthese surveys were carried out.

(GAM,\n2010)\nThere has been some growth in the numbers of\nhybrid and electric cars. However, their popularity\nis strongly dependent on government policy,\nwhich until now has not been consistent. In 2018,\nhybrid and electric cars still made up less than a\nquarter of the private cars in Jordan, as shown in\nthe table below.\n \nGasoline\nHybrid\nElectric\nTotal\nNo of Vehicles\n892,875\n244,080\n16,017\n1,153,271\n% of Vehicles\n77.4\n21.2\n1.4\n100\nSource: DOS, 2014-2018\nPublic transport (PT) in general is not well organized\nand lacks the infrastructure and interchanges\nrequired for a comfortable journey. There are few\nmode choices for PT, compared to other countries,\nthe available modes being: large bus, minibus and\nshared taxis (running on fixed routes). There is also\na lack of accessibility – with the coverage of PT\nservices in Jordan below the international average.\nIn general PT is considered suitable only for those\nwith no other option and this has led to its low\nshare of trips.\nThere is even lower share of trips carried out\nusing regular taxis, although these are not\ngenerally available outside of main centres. A\nnew innovation is the use of ride-hailing apps and\nseveral companies notably Uber and Careem, have\nbecome very popular after initial licensing issues\nwere resolved.\nAs a consequence of the introduction of ridehailing apps, a law was issued in 2017, which\nprohibits anyone from providing services relating\nto the transportation of passengers without\nTable 1.8: Number of private cars by fuel type in 2018\nA law has been passed that any new gas station,\nmust also provide electric charging points.\nHowever, until now, charging stations have not\nbeen provided in sufficient numbers to encourage\nthe uptake of electric vehicles. Currently there are\nonly around 50 charging stations for the whole\ncountry, and an agreement signed with German\nCompany e-Charge in 2018 to provide 10,000\nElectric vehicles (EV) charging stations has not yet\nbeen implemented. (Electromaps, 2020)\nThe uptake of electric cars has been slow and they\ncurrently make up only 1% of the private cars in\nJordan. As can be seen in the table below most\nof these are in Amman, although the numbers\nincreased sharply in 2019 in Zarqa and Irbid.\nTable 1.9: Electric cars registered in Amman and in Jordan\n\n29\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nbeing registered and licensed with the Land\nTransport Regulatory Commission (LTRC). Within\nthis framework, two regulations were issued in\n2018, which allowed for the complete licensing\nand registration of companies using ride-hailing\napplications: the Regulation concerning the\nTransportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications and the Instructions Regulating\nthe Transportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications.\nThere are currently about 12,500 vehicles in Jordan\nlicensed for use with ride hailing apps. Their effect\non mobility has not yet been studied in Jordan, so\nit is not clear whether trips are shifting from regular\ntaxi, public transport or private car or whether they\nare enabling “untapped demand”, trips that would\nnot otherwise be made.\nUber and Careem cars have the advantage of not\ntaking up space for parking. In fact difficulty of\nfinding parking is one reason why people may\nchoose to use their services. Additionally, since\nthey do not circulate looking for rides, there are\nexpected to be reductions in congestion, fuel\nconsumption and emissions, compared to regular\ntaxis.\nConcerning freight, the current modes used for\ntransport for imports and exports are by truck,\nplane, ship and pipeline. Truck is the most versatile,\nwith the most clearance points. Air freight is\ntransported through the three airports in Amman\nand Aqaba and shipping freight is transported\nthough Aqaba Port. Pipelines are used for import\nof natural gas through Aqaba.\nThe table 1.10 below shows the amount of\ntransported freight by weight, by mode and year.\nThere are no clear trends in the data.\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n8,840\n7,357\n6,977\n7,250\n8,564\nPlanes\n67\n76\n79\n83\n73\nShip\n21,075\n21,316\n23,361\n22,506\n20,998\nPipeline\n229\n234\n0\n0\n419\nTotal\n30,212\n28,982\n30,417\n29,839\n30,054\nIn the table below the percentage, by weight,\ntransported by each mode are compared. It can\nbe seen that the most important mode for freight\ntransport is ship, although this has been decreasing\nover the last few years. The second most important\nmode is truck, which has shown a corresponding\nincrease over the last few years. The share of freight,\nby weight, transported by plane and by pipeline,\nis minimal.\nTable 1.10: Freight transported by mode (gross weight in 1000 tonnes)\nTable 1.11: Freight transported by mode in %\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n29\n25\n23\n24\n28\nPlanes\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nShip\n70\n74\n77\n75\n70\nPipeline\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\nTotal\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n\n30\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nGovernance and Structure of the Transportation\nSector\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No.89, 2003. MoT is responsible\nfor developing the transport general policies and\nstrategies and supervising their implementation in\ncoordination and collaboration with the relevant\nentities. It is also responsible for regulating and\nmonitoring both public and freight transport. MoT\ncedes its responsibilities concerning planning and\nimplementation of transport to two organizations\nin different areas of Jordan. These are Greater\nAmman Municipality (GAM) and Aqaba Special\nEconomic Zone Authority (ASEZA).\nMinistry of Transport carries out its responsibilities\nin coordination with the related Government\norganizations described below:\n Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission (CARC)\nwas established in 2007 to replace the Civil\nAviation Authority (CAA) in accordance with\narticle 68 of the civil aviation law number 41\nof 2007. The function of CARC is to regulate\nall affairs pertaining to civil aviation including\nsafety, security, economic and environmental\naspects,\n The Transport Regulatory Commission- In July\n2020 the cabinet agreed to combine three\ntransport organizations into the Transport\nRegulatory\nCommission.\nThese\nformer\norganizations are: Land Transport Regulatory\nCommission (LTRC), the Jordan Maritime\nCommission (JMC) and the Jordan-Hejaz Railway\nCorporation,\n The Land Transport Regulatory Commission was\nestablished in 2010 to take over from the former\nPublic Transport Regulatory Commission (PTRC),\nbut with additional responsibility for freight\ntransport, by road. Its function is to regulate\nand monitor land transport and services, and\nits institutional objectives include: increasing\noperational efficiency of PT services, improving\nmobility of urban and rural populations and the\ndevelopment of environmentally sustainable PT\nservices,\n Jordan Maritime Commission (JMC) was\nestablished by royal decree in 2002 under the\ntitle of Jordan Maritime Authority. The name was\nrevised to JMC in 2014. JMC operates under the\nJordan Maritime Authority Law No. (46) Issued\nin 2006. Its function is to regulate, supervise and\ndevelop the maritime sector,\n The Jordan-Hejaz Railway Corporation was\nestablished in 1952, and it manages and\ninvests in the properties of the railway between\nMa’an and the Syrian border. It was used for\ntransporting freight between Jordan and Syria\nup until services were stopped about 10 years\nago as a result of the conflict in Syria.\nGreater Amman Municipality which has almost\n40% of the population of Jordan is responsible for\nall PT taking place completely inside its borders, an\narea of 800 km2. This responsibility was assumed\nin 2007 based on a law granting the municipality,\nplanning and regulatory authorities over PT. The\nintegrated Transportation and Traffic Management\nDirectorate was established shortly after this, to\nbring together these newly granted roles with\nGAM’s existing traffic engineering functions.\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA)\nwas created in 2001, within the Aqaba Governorate\nas a separate governance entity, covering an area\nof 375 km2 around the port city of Aqaba, including\nJordan’s entire 27 km marine coastline. ASEZA\nhas held responsibility for PT within the Aqaba\nMunicipality and between Amman and Aqaba\nsince 2000. ASEZA is also responsible for the port\nareas, the King Hussein International Airport and\nthe section of the Hejaz Railway between Aqaba\nand Ma’an and the additional link to the phosphate\nmines.\n\n31\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nMinistry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH)\nundertakes the construction and development\nof the network of roads in the country and is\nresponsible for setting plans and preparing the\nstudies and designs necessary for their construction.\nIn addition, they undertake tasks assigned by the\nGovernment of Jordan. A similar role is carried\nout within Greater Amman Municipality by the\nDepartment of Public Works and Housing within\nGAM and in Aqaba by the Department of Public\nWorks within ASEZA.\n1.10 Industry\nJordan is attractive for foreign investments in the\nMiddle East primarily due to its political stability\nand its central location in the region. Industry in\nJordan is principally dominated by manufacturing\nand mining.\nQualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) are business parks\nthat are recognized as free trade zones set up in\ncollaboration with the United States. Jordan is\none of two countries to have this arrangement,\nthe other being Egypt.\nIn Jordan, the Qualified Industrial Zones are:\n Al-Hassan Industrial Estate,\n Al-Hussein Ibn Abdullah II Industrial Estate,\n Jordan Industrial Estate Corporation,\n Jordan Cyber City,\n Al-Tajamouat Industrial Estate,\n Gateway QIZ,\n Aqaba Industrial Estate,\n Ad-Dulayl Industrial Park,\n El-Zai Ready-wear Manufacturing Company.\nThe manufacturing sector includes leather and\nfootwear manufacturing, chemicals, plastics, IT,\nfurniture, food, packaging, and manufacturing\nof engineering technology. The contribution of\nmanufacturing to GDP increased to 1347 million\nJD in the second quarter of 2019 from 1208.80 JD\nMillion in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining industry sector is one of the most\nimportant strategic industries. Mining contributes\nto the employment of local labor and caters to the\nneeds of the market for raw materials, while being\na source of hard currency.\nThe contribution of mining to GDP increased to\n175 million JD in the second quarter of 2019 from\n162.8 million JD in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining sector consists of the following subsectors:\n Phosphate and potash,\n Cement and chalk mining,\n Mining and extraction of limestone to produce\ncalcium carbonate,\n Mining and manufacturing kaolin, gypsum, and\nsilica,\n Extracting and crushing stone tablets, slabs,\nmarble, and granite stones and sand.\nPhosphate and potash are the most significant\nnatural resources in Jordan. The sector relies\nprimarily on large investments, driving several\nfirms to invest in such a promising field. The\nmining sector is the third largest industrial sector\nin terms of invested capital and the fourth largest\nsector in terms of exports in 2014. It also ranked\nfirst in terms of foreign investments in Jordan.\nMoreover, products from mining are used as\nraw material inputs for other industries such as\nfertilizers. Positive outlooks loom large as domestic\nvalue-added activities are increasingly combined\nwith investing in other areas, such as shale oil and\nuranium. This requires activating the exploitation\nof untapped raw materials in the Kingdom to\ncreate products that meet the global demand\nfor energy.      \n1.11 Waste Management\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of a high\npopulation growth rate and enforced migration.\nEconomic and cultural development has improved\nthe standard of living and changed consumer\nhabits, resulting in an increase in the volume of\nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) over time. No official\n\n32\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nstatistics have been disclosed regarding the\nincrease in solid waste generation after the influx\nof Syrian refugees. However, preliminary official\nestimates refer to more than 20-35% increase\nin solid waste generation in Jordan following\nthe Syrian crisis, putting a substantial burden\non municipalities as well as on the surrounding\necosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste collected from 100 municipalities is then\ntransported to transfer stations, sanitary landfills\nor open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded landfills\nin the country, most of which are not properly\ndesigned or operated, demonstrated by their lack\nof proper lining, leachate collection system, and\nlandfill gas management system. The only sanitary\nlandfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which receives 50%\nof the waste produced in Amman and Zarqa. AlGhabawi landfill is located 23 km to the East of\nAmman over an area of 2,000 Dunums, enough to\ndispose waste until 2035, using safe refuse/tipping\ntechniques. The Greater Amman Municipality\npurchased 1,000 Dunums from surrounding lands\nto rent out to the private sector to encourage\ninvestment in waste segregation and recycling.\nIn 1989, the Government of Jordan designated\nSwaqa landfill, 125 km to the South-East of\nAmman, as a facility to process hazardous\nwaste. The landfill is overseen and operated\nby the Ministry of Environment. The Ministry of\nEnvironment has also founded a centre in Swaqa\nlandfill to oversee the disposal of electronic waste\nin a safe manner to discourage improper storage\nand illegal re-selling. In general, the sector is in\nneed of studies to investigate the potential of\nwaste recycling.\nIt’s important to note that Bio-waste (organic\nwaste) dominates MSW; approximately 60% are\nfood waste, 14% paper and cardboards, 10%\nplastics. Therefore, MSW contains sufficient\nputrescible material which emit LFG (methane\n& CO2) for many years presenting a long-term\nexplosive and toxic hazard. Additionally, hazardous\nand non-MSW are not segregated and continue\nto reach final disposal sites posing serious health\nrisks for workers.\nIn Jordan, 48% of MSW is landfilled, 45% is\nopenly dumped and only 7% recycled. As a\nmatter of fact, recycling is mostly done by waste\npickers informally with no operational facility in\nplace. Furthermore, it is estimated that in 2034,\nMSW will reach 5.2 million tonnes (EC, 2016).\nConsidering these foreseeable challenges, in 2015\nthe Government of Jordan took a step forward\nwith the Decision No. 11392/02, and approved\nits first National Solid Waste Management\nStrategy 2015-2034 (NSWMS) in line with the\nrevised EU Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/\nEC which focuses on waste prevention and with\nthe EU-Jordan Compact 2016-2020 which sets\nthe sustainable use and management of natural\nresources as one of its priorities. The Strategy’s\nmain objective is to renovate the old, inefficient,\ncostly and environmentally unstable municipal\nsolid waste management system and convert it to\na modern and integrated one using the Three R’s\napproach (Reduce-Reuse-Recycle) within a span\nof 20 years. In particular, it seeks to prohibit the\nunsafe disposal of MSW and omit the disposal\nof industrial, construction, and medical wastes\nfrom facilities. In numeric-terms, 50% of existing\ndumpsites should be closed and 20 new transfer\nstations plus 10 new sanitary landfills should be\nconstructed (NSWMS, 2015).\n\n33\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nNo.\nSubject of Target\nProposed Targets for Jordan\nShort-term\nPeriod (20152019)\nMid-term\nPeriod (20202024)\nLong-term\nPeriod (20252034)\n1\nCatering for the emergency needs for\nMSWM due to the refugees’ influx\nDone\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n2\nCoverage of MSW street-cleaning and\ncollection services\n100%\n3\nSet-up of separate collection systems for\nrecyclables (at least paper, metal, plastic\nand glass)\n-\n100 % by 2034\n4\nPreparing for re-use and recycling of\nMSW materials (at least paper, metal,\nplastic and glass)\n-\n50% by weight\nby 2034\n5\nCease of operation of uncontrolled or\nunlicensed disposal sites\n50% by 2019\n100% by 2024\n6\nReduction of bio-waste ending-up to\nlandfills\n-\n75% by weight\nby 2034\n(according to\n2024 amounts)\n7\nRecovery of packaging waste (including\nreuse, materials’ recovery and energy\nrecovery)\n-\n25% by weight\nby 2034\n8\nRecycling of packaging waste\n-\n15% by weight\nby 2034\nReferences\n Ben-Sasson, M., Brenner, S., and Paldor, N.

Other gases\nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, such\nas sulphur oxides (SOx), included in the IPCC\nGuidelines may be included at the discretion\nof the Parties.\nThe GHG national inventory chapter addresses\nemissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide\n(N2O), methane (CH4), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons\n(PFCs). Those gases are supported by the\nsoftware and the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines. Nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)\nemissions resulting from the solvents subsector\nwere estimated using European Monitoring and\nEvaluation Programme (EMEP/EEA) air pollutant\nemission inventory guidebook 2019.\n2.2 Institutional Arrangements\nThe Ministry of Environment is the focal point for\nissues relevant to the UNFCCC and is responsible\nfor ensuring that Jordan’s commitments are met.\nPreparation of Jordan’s Second Biennial Update\nReport (SBUR) was coordinated by the Ministry of\nEnvironment in partnership with UNDP.\nAn agreement with the Royal Scientific Society\n(a national non-governmental, not-for-profit\nscientific organization) was realized to achieve\nthe work. The GHG inventory development was\naccomplished with the participation of a pool of\nnational experts representing different national\nentities, as demonstrated by the organizational\nchart in Figure 2.1.\n\n39\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.1: GHG inventory organizational chart\n\n40\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.3 Methodology and Inventory Estimation\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for the\nyears 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines and\nthe 2019 Refinement1 to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\nThe estimation of the overall national inventory\nwas carried out using the IPCC Inventory Software\nfor Parties not included in Annex I of the UNFCCC\n(ver. 2.691, released on 23 January 2020).\nThe sectors and subsectors that were considered\nare the following:\n1.\tEnergy:\n Stationary Combustion,\n Mobile Combustion,\n Fugitive Emissions.\n2.\tIndustrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU):\n Mineral Industry Emissions,\n Chemical Industry Emissions,\n Metal Industry Emissions,\n Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent\nUse,\n Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for Ozone\nDepleting Substances and Other Product\nManufacture and Use.\n3.\tAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU):\n Cropland and Forest Land,\n Emissions from Livestock and Manure\nManagement,\n N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2\nEmissions from Lime and Urea Application.\n4.\tWaste Generation, Composition, and\nManagement Data:\n Solid Waste Disposal,\n Biological Treatment of Solid Waste,\n Incineration and Open Burning of Waste,\n Wastewater Treatment and Discharge.\nIn May 2019 at IPCC 49th Session, the 2019\nRefinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories was adopted\nby the IPCC in Kyoto, Japan (Decision IPCC-XLIX-9).\nThe IPCC authors have examined a wide range\nof inventory methodologies and updated them,\nwhere scientific advances and new knowledge\nmade this necessary, following the IPCC decision.\nThe 2019 Refinement does not revise the 2006\nGuidelines, but updates, supplements and/or\nelaborates the 2006 Guidelines where gaps or\nout of date science have been identified. It will\nnot replace the 2006 Guidelines, and should be\nused in conjunction with the 2006 Guidelines.\nThe structure of 2019 Refinement is the same\nstructure as that of the 2006 Guidelines to make\nit easier for inventory compilers to use the 2019\nRefinement with the 2006 Guidelines. It includes\nan Overview Chapter and five volumes (General\nGuidance and Reporting (GGR), Energy, IPPU,\nAgriculture, AFOLU and Waste). The changes are\nindicated in each volume as Annex “Mapping\ntable” listing the types of refinements that have\nbeen done on the volume.\nIn brief, the main changes that were introduced\nto the different volumes are as follows:\n In Volume 1, adding a new guidance to all\nchapters,\n In Volume 2, introducing methodological issues\nin the stationary combustion and in the fugitive\nemissions chapters; adding new section for fuel\ntransformation and updating emission factors.\nAdditionally, updating the worksheet of the oil\nand natural gas systems,\n In volume 3, including updates for the emission\nfactors, and adding a new section for hydrogen\nproduction,\n In Volume 4, developing new guidance,\nupdating carbon stock change factors and\ndeveloping a new tier 2 method that requires\nless activity data than the current default\nmethod.\n1. All updates, supplements and/or elaborates on the 2006\nGuidelines were identified and adopted in this chapter.\n\n41\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n Finally, in volume 5, updating the default data,\nupdating the wastewater treatment chapter\nto reflect additional types of treatment and\ndisposal systems.\nThe guidance on appropriate estimation methods\nwithin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines that includes\ncross-sectoral good practice guidance for\ninventory preparation were consulted. It includes\nmethods for collection of activity data, key\ncategory analysis, quality assurance and control,\nand inventory planning and documentation.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nand in units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by sources and removals by sinks. Most\nsectors and subsectors used Tier 1.\nIndirect GHGs were estimated, whenever the\nactivity data were available, using the EMEP\nGuidelines and methodology.\nFor reporting purposes, the notation keys NO\n(not occurring) or NE (not estimated) and NA\n(not applicable) were used as necessary in the\ninventory reporting tables.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC Second Assessment Report\n(SAR) temporal horizon 100 years were used. The\nfollowing sections report Jordan’s GHG inventories\nby sector and on a gas by gas basis.\n2.4 GHG Inventories by Sector\nAccording to the overall GHG Inventory estimates,\nJordan contributed 31,063.32 Gg of CO2eq in 2016.\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the Energy Sector is the\nmajor emitter accounting for around 76% of\ntotal national emissions followed by the Waste\nSector with a contribution of around 12%.

The\nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the NDCs\ntarget by 2030. The total renewable capacity by\nthe end of 2018 was 1,130 MW and was expected\nto reach 2,400 MW by the end of 2020, accounting\nfor 20% of the generated electricity, compared\nto 1% in 2014 (MEMR, 2018). The largest energy\nconsumer in 2018 was the transport sector with a\n49% share followed by household, industrial and\nother services sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14%\nshare respectively.\n\n43\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nEnergy-related activities have a dominant share\nof GHG emissions in Jordan. Emissions from this\nsector are classified into two main categories:\n Emissions from fuel combustion,\n Non-combustion (fugitive) emissions.\nGHGs Emissions in 2016\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016, resulting primarily\nfrom fuel combustion activities, as shown in Table\n2.2. Fugitive emissions (from oil and natural gas)\nwere negligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with shares of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial,\nand Agriculture) accounted for 10% and 10%\nrespectively of the total, as indicated in Figure 2.3.\nTable 2.2: Energy sector aggregated emissions, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\nCH4\nN2O\nAggregated\nemissions in\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nGg\nGg of CO2 eq\nENERGY SECTOR\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\n23,649.47\nFuel Combustion Activities\n23,032.67\n60.10\n155.39\n23,248.15\nEnergy Industries\n8,956.12\n4.35\n9.12\n8,969.59\nManufacturing Industries and Construction\n2,432.06\n1.41\n7.01\n2,440.47\nTransport\n8,609.48\n43.73\n133.50\n8,786.71\nOther Sectors (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture)\n2,354.95\n8.88\n4.40\n2,368.23\nNon-Specified\n680.06\n1.73\n1.36\n683.15\nFugitive emissions (Oil and Natural Gas)\n21.92\n379.29\n0.10\n401.31\nFigure 2.3: Shares of emission (%) per subsector within the energy sector, 2016\n\n44\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nInternational Bunkers, 2016\nAs per Decision 17/CP, to the extent possible, and\nif data are available, non-Annex I Parties should\nreport emissions from international aviation and\ninternational water-borne navigation separately\nin their inventories.

The emissions were\ngenerated mainly from:\n Mineral Industry (mainly cement production),\n Products used as substitutes for Ozone Depleting\nSubstances (ODS) (mainly Refrigeration, Air\nConditioning, and Fire Protection),\n The Chemicals Industry (mainly Nitric Acid\nproduction Subsectors.\nThe IPPU sector was a source of NMVOCs emissions\nand accounted for 32.61 Gg. In addition to CO2\nand NMVOCs, the sector generated emissions of\nHFCs with 757.29 Gg of CO2eq.

The southern and eastern parts of the\ncountry are arid with hot dry summers and cold\ndry winters. Temperature increases towards the\nsouth, with exceptions in some southern highlands.\nPrecipitation is extremely variable and is confined\nlargely to the winter and early spring seasons. It\nranges from over 500mm in the highlands to less\nthan 50mm in the east. The long-term average\nannual precipitation is 8,317 million cubic meters,\nof which, about 92.5% is lost to evaporation. The\nEastern Desert (also known as the Badia) that\nlies east of the mountainous region and covers\nabout 80% of the land area of Jordan has a low\nprecipitation (the Updated Rangeland Strategy\nfor Jordan, 2014).\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture 2018\nstatistical report, cultivated land accounts for (2.32.8 million dunums). On average, irrigated areas\ncomprise around 1 million dunums (60% of the\ncultivated areas), whereas on average rainfed areas\nmake up around 1.5 million dunums (40% of the\ncultivated areas).\nThe contribution of agriculture to the GDP, in\nrelative terms, declined sharply from 40% in\nthe 1950s to 4.8% in 2018. Irrespective of how\nhumble the contribution of agriculture is to GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of the agricultural\nsector stems from the fact that it is not only a major\nsource of food, particularly dairy products, fruits\nand vegetables, but it is also a source of livelihood\nfor around 25-30% of the total poor population\n(livestock keepers, smallholder farm households,\nand landless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas (World Bank- Technical Note, 2018).\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016, acting as a net\nemission source. The emissions were composed\nof methane and nitrous oxide and were generated\nby various subcategories. AFOLU emissions and\nremovals are shown in Table 2.6 and Figure 2.5.\n\n47\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.6: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nNet\n(Gg CO2 eq)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nAgriculture, Forestry, and\nOther Land Use\n-896.76\n614.6\n710.9\n428.71\nLivestock\nNA\n610\n20.44\n630.45\nLand\n-922.54\nNA\nNA\n-922.54\nAggregate sources and nonCO2 emissions sources on land\n25.78\n4.611\n690.4\n720.80\nFigure 2.5: Emissions of the AFOLU sector (Gg CO2eq), 2016\n2.4.4 Waste sector\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhave improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of MSW over time. No official statistics\nhave been disclosed regarding the increase in\nsolid waste generation after the influx of Syrian\nrefugees. However, preliminary official estimates\nrefer to more than a 20-35% increase in solid waste\ngeneration in Jordan following the Syrian crisis,\nputting a substantial burden on municipalities as\nwell as on the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan.\nSolid waste collected from 100 municipalities\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km\nto the east of Amman, and covers an area of over\n2,000 Dunums, enough to dispose waste until 2035,\nusing safe refuse/tipping techniques. Additionally,\nGg CO2eq\n\n48\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nthe Greater Amman Municipality purchased 1,000\ndunums from surrounding lands to rent out to the\nprivate sector to encourage investment in waste\nsegregation and recycling.\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nIn 2016, GHG emissions from the waste sector\nreached 3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for\n12% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3559.01 Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions,\nwhile wastewater handling accounted for 5%\n(188.40Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\nTable 2.7 and Figure 2.6 show 2016 emissions\nbreakdown by the waste sector.\nTable 2.7: Emissions of the waste sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nTotal CO2eq\n(Gg)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\n3807.73\nSolid Waste Disposal\nNA\n3,559.01\nNA\n3,559.01\nIncineration and Open Burning of Waste\n32.66\n23.11\n4.56\n60.32\nWastewater Treatment and Discharge\nNA\n39.38\n149.02\n188.40\nFigure 2.6: Emissions (%) by the waste sector, 2016\n\n49\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.5 GHG Inventory by Gas\n2.5.1 GHG Emissions in 2016\nThe share of carbon dioxide was the largest with a contribution of 24,385.37 Gg, accounting for 79%\nof all GHGs emissions, followed by CH4 with a contribution of 4,675.49 Gg of CO2eq at only 15%, as\nindicated in Figure 2.7.\nFigure 2.7: National emissions (%) by gas, 2016\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nwere produced by the energy sector accounting for\n95%, followed by 9% from the IPPU sector. Methane\nemissions were highest from the waste sector\nfollowed by the AFOLU sector with contributions of\n70% and 17%, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions\nwere highest from the AFOLU sector with 57%,\nfollowed by the IPPU, Energy and waste sectors, with\ncontributions of 18%, 13% and 12%, respectively.\nAs expected, the IPPU sector contributed 100% of\nHFCs while the NMVOCs emissions resulted from\nthe IPPU and the energy sectors.\nWithin the energy sector, the main emissions were\nin the form of CO2 (97%). Within the IPPU sector,\nthe key GHGs were CO2 followed by HFCs with\nshares of 69% and 24%, respectively. Nitrous oxide\nemissions were highest from the AFOLU sector, with\naround 57% mainly from fertilizers and manure\nmanagement.

This approach\nprovides estimates of CO2 to compare with\nestimates derived using a Sectoral Approach. The\nReference Approach provides an upper bound\nto the Sectoral Approach ‘1A Fuel Combustion’,\nbecause some of the carbon in the fuel is not\ncombusted but is released as fugitive emissions\n(as leakage or evaporation in the production\nand/or transformation stage). Calculating CO2\nemissions with the two approaches can lead to\ndifferent results for some countries.\nThe Reference Approach was used to calculate\nenergy sector emissions in 2016 and the results\nwere compared to those of the Sectoral Approach.\nThe gap between the two approaches should\nbe relatively small (5% or less). For Jordan, the\ncalculated differences were acceptable; less than\n5%, as indicated in Table 2.11.\nTable 2.11: Reference approach vs sectoral approach for the year 2016\nYear\nReference Approach\nSectoral\nDifference\nCO2 Emissions (Gg)\n%\n2016\n24,017.75\n23,043.18\n4.23\nGHG emissions were also estimated using the\nReference Approach for the time series (2013-2016)\n(Table 2.12 and Figure 2.9).\nThe outcomes indicated a steady increase in\nthe energy consumption for 2013-2016, and\nan unexpected decrease in 2015 emissions was\nnoticed which was due to a change in the energy\nmix of electricity generation in the form of using\nnatural gas a less carbon intense fuel than Diesel.\nTable 2.12: Energy consumption and emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\nYear\nEnergy Consumption (TJ)\nCO2 (Gg)\n2013\n317,581.57\n22,772.64\n2014\n327,784.75\n24,136.90\n2015\n345,185.21\n23,936.91\n2016\n379,660.75\n24,017.75\n\n55\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.9: Variations in emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\n2.8 Time Series and Comparison between\nCurrent and Previous Inventories\nThe time series is a central component of the\ngreenhouse gas inventory because it provides\ninformation on historical emissions trends and\ntracks the effects of strategies to reduce emissions\nat the national level. As is the case with estimates for\nindividual years, emission trends should be neither\nover nor underestimated as far as can be judged.\nAll emissions estimates in a time series should be\nestimated consistently, which means that as far\nas possible, the time series should be calculated\nusing the same method and data sources in all\nyears. Using different methods and data in a time\nseries could introduce bias because the estimated\nemission trend will reflect not only real changes\nin emissions or removals but also the pattern of\nmethodological refinements. Chapter five, volume\none of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was consulted\nin terms of good practices ensuring time series\nconsistency.\nRecalculations were carried out for the years\n2010 and 2012. Also, techniques for combining\nor “splicing” different methods or data sets to\ncompensate for incomplete or missing data were\nused for estimating years the 2000 and 2006.\nFigure 2.10 and Table 2.13 provides an overview\nof time series estimation:\n As expected, an increase in GHG emissions\nwas noticed between the different years due\nto population growth and increased economic\nactivities,\n The category 1.B - Fugitive emissions from fuels\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 were recalculated\nusing the correct emissions factor for onshore\n- developing country and this resulted in new\nfigures (from 1.02 and 1.26 Gg CO2eq to 235.98\nGg CO2eq and 336.75 Gg CO2eq respectively),\n Also, the 2.D - Non-Energy Products from Fuels\nand Solvent Use category was recalculated\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 due to an error in\nemission factor unit conversion. Results were\nmodified from 208.80 Gg CO2eq and 226.88 Gg\nCO2eq to 2.85 Gg CO2eq and 3.09 Gg CO2eq,\n All sectors for 1994 will be calculated as part of\nthe third BUR. Collecting data was challenging\ndue to difficulties in getting the activity data in\ndue time,\n The IPPU and AFOLU sectors for the years\n2000 and 2006 were not estimated due to\ndifficulties in getting the activity data in due\ntime. Recalculation will be carried out as part\nof the third BUR.\n\n56\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.10: Comparison between time series for the energy and the waste sectors\nThe above figure illustrates a comparison between\nthe energy and waste sectors for the years of 2000,\n2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016.

Non-Annex I Parties are\nencouraged (Decision 17/CP.8), to the extent\npossible, to undertake any key category analysis\nto assist in developing inventories that better\nreflect their national circumstances. The analysis\nwas carried out based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines\nand Software. Jordan used “level” key category\nanalysis where the contribution of each source or\nsink category to the total national inventory level\nwas calculated. The key categories according to the\nguidelines are those that, when summed together\nin descending order of magnitude, add up to 95%\nof the sum of all level assessment.\nIn categories that are identified as key, parties\nshould try to use a recommended method, in\naccordance with the corresponding decision tree\nin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It is recommended\nthat Jordan searches for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to the\nextent possible and based on software readiness\nand national circumstances, Tier 2 methods in the\ncategories identified as key.\nAs shown in Table 2.14 for the year 2016, the key\ncategory analysis resulted in thirteen subcategories;\nthe top four accounting for around 64.9% of all\nemissions, were:\n Fuel Combustion Activities subcategories:\nEnergy Industries (Gaseous Fuels), Road\nTransportation, Energy Industries (Liquid Fuels),\nand other sectors (commercial/institutional and\nresidential-Liquid Fuels),\n The solid waste management subcategory.\n\n58\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.14: Key category analysis (level assessment), 2016\nA\nB\nC\nD\nF\nG\nIPCC\nCategory\ncode\nIPCC Category\nGHG\n2016\nEmissions\nCO2eq (Gg)\n2016\nEmissions\nLevel from\nthe Given\nCategory\nCumulative Total\n% of Column F\n1.A.3.b\nRoad Transportation\nCO2\n8566.56\n0.26\n26.4%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nGaseous Fuels\nCO2\n6495.61\n0.20\n46.3%\n4.A\nSolid Waste Disposal\nCH4\n3559.01\n0.11\n57.3%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nLiquid Fuels\nCO2\n2460.51\n0.08\n64.9%\n1.A.4\nOther Sectors - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2365.46\n0.07\n72.1%\n2.A.1\nCement production\nCO2\n1751.43\n0.05\n77.5%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n1669.84\n0.05\n82.7%\n3.B.1.a\nForest land Remaining\nForest land\nCO2\n-922.77\n0.03\n85.5%\n2.F.1\nRefrigeration and Air\nConditioning\nHFCs,\nPFCs\n762.23\n0.02\n87.9%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Solid\nFuels\nCO2\n737.23\n0.02\n90.1%\n1.A.5\nNon-Specified - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n680.06\n0.02\n92.2%\n3.A.1\nEnteric Fermentation\nCH4\n574.08\n0.02\n94.0%\n3.C.4\nDirect N2O Emissions\nfrom managed soils\nN2O\n510.55\n0.02\n95.6%\n2.10 Uncertainty Analysis\nThe uncertainty analysis is one of the main activities\nof the inventory process. Uncertainty information\nis intended to help prioritize efforts to improve the\naccuracy of inventories and guide decisions on the\nmethodological choice.\nThe analysis was carried out based on IPCC 2006\nGuidelines and Software. “Approach 1: Propagation\nof Error” was used. Approach 1 is based upon error\npropagation and is used to estimate uncertainty in\nindividual categories in the inventory as a whole,\nand in trends between 2016 and the base year\n2010. The uncertainty analysis was based on\nTier 1 approach and covers all source-categories\nand all direct greenhouse gases. The uncertainty\nestimation for the activity data and emission factors\nwas based on typical values of the IPCC.\nThe results indicate that net emissions in 2016\nwere 26,794.86 Gg of CO2eq with an uncertainty\nof ±5%, which corresponds to a 95% probability\n\n59\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nrange of 27,598.71 to 25,991.01 Gg of CO2eq. Based\nupon the total base year of 2010 and year 2016\ninventories, the average trend is a 34% increase\nin emissions from 2010 to 2016. The uncertainty\nin the trend is ±4% (percentage points), which\ncorresponds to a 95% probability range for the\ntrend with respect to base year emissions.\n2.11 GHG Inventory Quality Control/Quality\nAssurance and Review\nJordan acknowledges the need for having a manual\nfor national QC/QA procedures for GHG inventory\nestimation. This has been listed in Jordan’s future\nimprovement plans (section 2.12). Also, during the\npreparation of the GHG Inventories, the inventory\nteam and the BUR project management team\ncarried out the following tasks:\n Overall assessment technical reviews, and\naccuracy checks performed by the compilers\nto ensure consistency, accuracy, completeness\nand avoid double counting,\n Checking the accuracy of data input from the\noriginal references and confirm that correct\nreferences were used as well as ensuring that\nno transcription errors exist,\n Checking that parameter and emission units\nare correctly recorded and that appropriate\nconversion factors are used and checking as\nwell for consistency if more than one expert\nused same conversions and factor among\nvarious subsectors,\n Checking that the movement of inventory data\namong processing steps is correct,\n Checking that there is detailed internal\ndocumentation to support the estimates and\nenable full reconstruction of the estimate,\n Checking that inventory data are archived and\nstored to facilitate detailed review,\nIn terms of quality assurance the national GHG\ninventory chapter was subjected to an international\nreview which was coordinated by the UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Program (GSP) and was conducted\nfrom 7 to 13 October 2020 by Dr. Carlos López,\nconsultant in national GHG emissions inventories.\nThe review examined mainly the adherence of the\ninventory chapter to the requirements indicated in\nthe UNFCCC Decision 17/CP.8 Annex, the UNFCCC\nDecision 2/CP.17 Annex III, and to the advice of\nthe IPCC Guidelines and Guidance. The outcomes\nof the review resulted in several direct actions\nto improve the chapter and an inventory future\nimprovement plan (IIP); described in details in the\nfollowing section.\n2.12 Future Improvement Plan\nSeveral actions were identified by the GSP\nreviewer. The improvements are listed below\nand are rated according to urgency as; immediate,\nshort term and long term actions:\n\tThe activity data used in the estimate, especially\nin the subcategories identified as key or\nsignificant , should be improved as much as\npossible, in order to use tier 2. Also, actions to\nimprove data, methods, EF and other estimation\nparameters (OEP) should be prioritized in\nkey categories to use tier 2 (especially in the\nsubcategory 2F1a, 4A Solid Waste Disposal,\n3A1c Sheep and 3B Land). (short term and\nlong term),\n\tThe documentation boxes and worksheet\nremarks included within the software should\nbe added. (short term),\n\tThe completeness of the inventory should be\nimproved by: (short term to long term),\n- Improving the estimation and reporting of\nprecursor gas emissions in future inventory\nsubmissions (activity data and EF are mostly\navailable),\n- Incorporating among the precursor gases,\nthe estimation of NH3 emissions. This would\nmake it possible to calculate in category 5A\nthe indirect N2O Emissions derived from the\natmospheric deposition of Nitrogen from non\nagriculture sources,\n- The precursor gas emissions of these\nsubcategories from the second order\nsubcategories 1.A.3.a.i - International aviation\n\n60\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nand 1.A.3.d.i - International water-borne\nnavigation (international bunkers) should\nbe estimated and should be reported; using\nthe notation key NE (not-estimated) in the\nreporting tables, as necessary,\n The key analysis -trend assessment should be\nused after improving issues related to the time\nseries of the inventory. Also, qualitative criteria\nshould be applied to the categories located\nat the threshold of 95-97% of cumulative\nemissions. (short term),\n Prepare a QA/QC and verification plan and\nmanual for the coming inventory (short term).\nReferences\n\t2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and its 2019 Refinement.\n\tAmman Chamber of Industry Website, http://www.aci.org.jo, accessed December, 2019.\n\tArab Fertilizers and Chemical Industries (Kemapco).\n\tAmman Chamber of Industry Website, http://www.aci.org.jo, accessed December 2016.\n\tAmount and Characterization of Dairy Cattle Manure and Poultry Litter in Jordan, AECOM, August\n2014.\n\tCentral Bank of Jordan – Statistical Database, http://statisticaldb.cbj.gov.jo/index, accessed December\n2019.\n\tCustoms Department, letter No. 18/14/131 dated 8/1/2020\n\tDepartment of Statistics website: www.web.dos.gov.jo accessed May 2020\n\tDepartment of statistics, Jordan’s country analysis; environmental indicators, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2010,\n2012, and 2016.\n\tEnergy and Minerals Regulatory Commission (EMRC).\n\tEEA, 2019.

This requires a projection of the current\nlevels to future levels of each type of activity.\nThe newly released strategies, policies, action\nplans and committed projects were reviewed\nand summarized. In addition, all projects and\nactions that were part of FBUR baseline scenario\nwere reviewed to update their status. Based on\nthis review, the most probable future trends in\nactivities that will impact and shape the GHG\nemissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n-\nThe new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n-\nThe\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August\n2020,\n-\nThe\nnew\nsolid\nwaste\nmanagement\nframework law issued in March 2020 and\nentered in force in September 2020,\n-\nNational Renaissance Plan (2019-2020),\nissued in 2018,\n-\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n- The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in 2016,\n Update of FBUR mitigation measures: All\nFBUR mitigation projects were reviewed and\nassessed to identify all those still valid. The\nvalid projects were updated, after adjustments\nwere made in their expected implementation\ntimeline. The emission reduction and the unit\ncost of emission reduction for each mitigation\nproject have been recalculated taking into\nconsideration several factors such as the\n\n65\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nimprovement in technologies and changes\nin prices. Net present value was used in the\nfinancial calculations, by converting all present\nand future revenues and costs over the project’s\nlifetime to a base of today’s cost. The same\napproach was followed in calculating the CO2eq\nemissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nmitigation projects. A discount rate of 8% was\nused for both the cost and emission reduction\ncalculations. Also, the discounted unit cost of\nreduced emission reduction was calculated as\nthe quotient of the discounted cost in JD to\nthe discounted emission in tonnes CO2. The\nupdated FBUR mitigation projects include\n23 GHG mitigation measures in the sectors\nand subsectors of primary energy, renewable\nenergy, energy efficiency, industries, domestic\nsolid waste and wastewater, and agriculture\nand forestry.\n3.2 Baseline Scenario for the Different Sectors\n3.2.1 Baseline scenario for the energy sector\nA. The Current Status of the Infrastructure\nEnergy Projects Listed in the FBUR\nA.1 The delayed energy infrastructure projects\nExpansion of Jordan Oil Refinery Project\nA decision was made to implement an expansion\nto Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC),\nin order to improve the specifications of the\npetroleum products and to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products. Having\nan environmental management system is a\nrequirement from the IFC to grant the JPRC\nloan for expansion. Early 2020, the Refinery\nCompany published a call for services, specifically\nto undertake the planning of an environmental\nmanagement system, that includes environmental\nimpact assessment, environmental audit, health\nand safety and risk assessment. Due to COVID-19,\nthe implementation of this assessment was\ndelayed and accordingly the expansion has been\ndelayed. The expected date of completion for the\nproject is now 2025, instead of 2022.\nConstruction of the Iraqi Crude Oil Pipeline\nDue to the political situation in the region a delay\noccurred in the construction of the Iraqi crude oil\npipeline, which was supposed to transport Iraqi\ncrude oil across Jordanian territory to the export\nterminal in Aqaba with a capacity of 1 million\nbarrels/day, in addition to a branch to supply\nJordan Oil Refinery with 150 thousand barrels/\nday. The date of completion for the construction\nand operation of the pipeline is expected to be\n2027 instead of 2022.\nOil shale surface retorting projects\nAll the companies working in surface retorting\nof oil shale are still unable to fulfill the agreed\nobligations in their production schedules, due to\nchanges in economic feasibility. All the oil shale\ncompanies have been asked to postpone their\nproject development period some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed.\nNuclear Power Plant of 1,000 MW\nIn February 2019, the Ministerial Council took a\ndecision to cancel the construction of the nuclear\npower plant with a proposed capacity of 1,000\nMW, which was planned to be operational and\ncontributing to the electricity system in 2023.\nThis is due to the over committed electricity\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW. The council\ndecided to consider the introduction of smaller\nreactors instead.\nThe third round of the renewable energy projects\nThe decision was taken in the Ministry of Energy\nand Mineral Resources to delay the third round of\nthe renewable energy projects which consists of\nfour 50 MW solar and two 50 MW wind projects\ndue to the decrease in the growth rate of electricity\ndemand, which was 0-1.5% during the period\n2017-2019, and due to the over-committed\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW.\n\n66\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nA.2 The completed infrastructure projects\nMany infrastructure projects, policies, laws and\nbylaws have witnessed successful implementation\nas follows.\nCrude oil and oil products storage\nAll of the strategic projects to increase the storage\ncapacities of crude oil and oil products were\ncompleted on EPC basis and put in operation as\nplanned at the end of 2017, these projects are\nlisted below:\n-\nConstruction of 100 thousand tonnes\nstorage capacity for crude oil in Aqaba,\n-\nConstruction of strategic storage capacities\nfor light oil products with a capacity of\n250-300 thousand tonnes, and 8 thousand\ntonnes for LPG in Almadonah area, in central\nJordan,\n-\nEstablishment of the Oil Logistics Company\nin 2017 to secure the strategic storage\ncapacity of oil and oil products needed for\nthe country.\nElectricity generation and transmission projects\n\nThe new Zarqa Power Plant Project was\ncompleted, with a capacity of 485 MW, at\nthe site of the previous Hussein Power Plant.\nThe plant owned by ACWA Power Company,\noperates mainly on natural gas as primary\nfuel and diesel as secondary fuel. The project\nwas successfully completed and put into\noperation in the year 2019.\n\nThe first electric power plant using coke and\ncoal was completed in Al Karak governorate\nof Jordan, with a generation capacity of 30\nMW. The plant is equipped with the latest\nequipment and technologies in addition\nto the adherence to the internationally\nrecognized environmental standards. The\nplant was put into operation in 2018.\n\nIn mid-2019, the Green Corridor Project\nwas completed and put into operation. The\nproject’s aim is to transmit between 800-1,000\nMW of electricity from renewable energy\nsources, from the south to the load centres\nin other regions in Jordan. This project will\naccommodate electrical power generated\nfrom new renewable energy sources.\nNatural gas projects\nThe construction of the natural gas pipeline in\nthe north of Jordan, designed to import natural\ngas from Nobel Energy Company was completed\nin 2020. The pipeline was constructed according\nto the agreement signed between the National\nPower Company (NEPCO) and Nobel Energy in\n2018.\nRenewable energy projects\nA remarkable achievement in the completion\nof renewable energy projects for electricity\ngeneration has been achieved. All the renewable\nenergy projects listed and considered in the\nbaseline scenario in the FBUR and planned to be\nexecuted by the end of 2019, were completed in\ndue time, as planned.\nBy the end of 2019, 850 MW of solar and 375 MW\nof wind projects were connected to the grid,\nincluding 150 MW net metering projects and\n130 MW wheeling projects.

The Energy Baseline Scenario in the SBUR for\nthe Period 2016-2066\nIn order to build the energy demand and supply\nbaseline scenario in the SBUR, several matters\nand issues which will affect and drive the energy\nscenario will be considered. The most important\nof these are as follows.\nB.1 The over commitment of electricity generation\ncapacity in the country\nThe generation capacity of thermal power plants as\nof the end of September 2019 reached (4,257 MW)\nand while the generation capacity of renewable\nenergy projects (solar and wind) reached (1,130\nMW). Comparatively the maximum peak load for\nthe first half of 2019 was around 3,000 MW.\nThis volume of available generating capacity is\nlarge compared to the maximum peak load and\neven, considering the capacity of conventional\ngeneration stations only, exceeds it by 30%.\n This is in contrast to the internationally recognized\npractices in this industry, which has limits of 10%\n-15%, especially in electrical systems that are\nconnected to electric networks similar to the\nJordanian network. This causes significant costs for\nthe electrical system, since there is a commitment\nto pay for the cost of capacity for the power stations,\n\n69\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\neven if their operation is suspended, according to\nthe Energy Purchase Agreement, which is based on\nthe principle of take or pay. Continuous operation\nof the power stations is not needed as a result of\nthe decline in growth rates in electricity demand\ndue to many reasons, among these:\n\nA high growth rate for the peak load of 6.2%\nannually was adopted in the electrical system\nexpansion planning. However, the actual\ngrowth rate during the three years of (20172019) ranged between (0% - 2%). This was\na result of consumers’ tendency to increase\nthe use of energy-saving technologies, and\nto expand dependence on self-generation\nthrough small and large renewable energy\nprojects, and\n\nEconomic growth decline as a result of\npolitical conditions in the region.\nB.2 The new National Energy Strategy for the\nperiod 2020-2030\nThe Ministry of Energy issued a new energy\nstrategy for the period 2020-2030 and it was\napproved by the Ministerial Council in March 2020\ntogether with a framework implementation plan.\nThe new energy strategy re- estimated the annual\ngrowth rate of the primary energy demand for\nthe period 2020-2030 to be 0.9%, and the annual\ngrowth rate of the electricity demand for the same\nperiod to be 1.1% compared to 2.4% and 4.1% for\nprimary energy demand and electricity demand\nrespectively considered in the previous energy\nstrategy (2015-2025). Table (3.3) illustrate the\ncomparison of the electricity demand in GWh\nbetween the two strategies.\nTable 3.3: Comparison of electricity demand (GWh) within the two energy strategies\nYears\n2020\n2023\n2025\n2030\nEnergy Strategy 2020-2030\n17,672\n17,950\n18,686\n19,701\nEnergy Strategy 2015-2025\n23,150\n26,470\n28,900\n34,990\nThe new strategy aims to achieve energy security\nfor the country and to increase the contribution of\nthe local resources in the energy mix. It also aims\nto decrease the heavy burden of the energy cost\non the national economy and to study the impacts\nof renewable energy projects on the electricity\ngeneration system.\nConsidering the above mentioned issues and facts,\nand according to the previous energy strategy\n2015-2025 and the new energy strategy 2020-2030\nwith their components and the implementation\nplans; the most probable baseline scenario in the\nenergy sector will be based on the adopted goals,\npolicies, and laws, and the planned and committed\nprojects within the energy strategies.\nPolicies, projects and activities considered in the\nbaseline scenario up to 2030 and beyond to 2066\nThe most reliable policies, projects and activities\nconsidered in the baseline scenario up to 2030 and\nbeyond to the year 2066 are summarized in the\nfollowing sections.\nThe Field of Oil and Oil Products\nThe main policy: Securing the needs of the\nKingdom’s crude oil and oil products. Securing the\nKingdom’s oil products needs will be achieved by\nthe following:\n\nJordan Petroleum Refinery will continue to\nproduce 14 thousand tonnes per day (100\nthousand barrels) to meet 60% of the need\nof the domestic market for oil products,\naccording to 2015 statistics. The remainder\nof the needs of the domestic market for oil\nproducts will be imported. This arrangement\nis proposed to last up to 2040.\n\nImplement the expansion of the Jordan\nPetroleum Refinery in order to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products and\nimprove the specifications of petroleum\nproducts. The expansion is planned to be\ncompleted by 2026.\n\n70\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nContinue to meet Jordan’s needs for crude\noil by importing oil from Saudi Arabia by sea,\nthen transporting it in oil tankers to the oil\nrefinery in the centre area of the kingdom.\nThis is planned to continue up to 2027.\n\nConstruction of the Iraqi crude oil pipeline\nto export Iraqi crude oil across Jordanian\nterritory to the export terminal in Aqaba\nwith a capacity of 1 million barrels/day in\naddition to a branch to supply Jordan Oil\nRefinery with 150 thousand barrels/day. The\npipeline is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nThe continuation of the policy of liberalization\nof prices of petroleum products, and pricing\noil products on a monthly basis in accordance\nwith international oil prices. The pricing\npolicy is the most successful mechanism\nand technique to improve the efficiency of\nconsumption.\nThe Field of Natural Gas\nThe main policy: diversifying the natural gas\nresources.\nAfter the completion and construction of LNG\nterminal in Aqaba which went into commercial\noperation in September 2015, Jordan has the\nability to meet all the country’s needs for natural\ngas for electricity generation and for the industrial\nsector.\nCurrently, Jordan imports natural gas by three\nroutes: via the LNG terminal in Aqaba which\nwent into commercial operation in September\n2015, via the Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt and\nvia pipeline from the Noble Energy Company on\na take or pay basis.\nIn 2019, 86% of the electricity generation of the\nKingdom was based on natural gas imported via\nthe LNG terminal and Egyptian natural gas.\nThe natural gas needed for electricity generation\nduring the period 2016-2022 was estimated to\nbe 350-420 Million Metric Cubic Feet per Day\n(MMcfd). However in the period 2023-2025, the\nquantity will be decreased to 250-350 MMcfd, due\nto the operation of the oil shale power plants.\nThe demand of the industrial sector for natural\ngas is estimated to be 150 MMcfd in the same\nperiod of 2023-2025.\nIn addition, the National Petroleum Company\n(NPC) plans to develop the Risha gas field, in\nJordan, to increase natural gas production\nfrom the site, to 50 MMcfd as a 1st stage. NPC\nhas announced the Risha field as an investment\nopportunity, and is aiming to attract a strategic\npartner for this project.\nIn regard to utilizing waste to generate electricity,\nthe following two projects will be considered:\n- A power plant will be built, which will operate\non direct burning of solid waste, with a\ncapacity of (50 MW) in the Central Area of\nthe Kingdom.\n- A bio–gas power plant will be built, with a\ncapacity of (25 MW), in Ghabawi area, East of\nAmman, , to be operational, in 2022.\nThe Field of Renewable Energy\nThe main policy: utilizing the renewable energy\nresources to generate electricity.\nIn light of the large progress in utilizing the\nrenewable energy resources to generate electricity,\nthe total capacity of the constructed, under\nconstruction and committed projects during the\nperiod 2020-2023 will reach 2400 MW as illustrated\nearlier. Considering the NEPCO situation, the total\nnew capacity of wind and solar energy to be added\nto the system during the period 2024-2030 will be\n600 MW of which 400 MW will be wheeling and\nnet metering systems.\nThe Field of Oil Shale\nThe main policy: utilizing the oil shale resources\nto generate electricity and produce oil.\n\n71\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n Oil shale projects for electricity generation\nDue to the over-committed generating capacity\nin terms of MW, the second direct burning of oil\nshale project for electricity generation will be\nconsidered in the year 2028.\n Oil shale projects for extraction of oil shale\nAll oil shale companies were asked to postpone\nthe development period, and some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed their businesses. Oil shale\ncompanies that asked for development period\nextension were Jordan Oil Shale Company (JOSCO)\nwhich was intending to produce 20,000 barrels of\noil shale in 2025, Jordan Oil Shale Energy Company\n(JOSE) intending to produce 20,000 barrels/day\nin 2025, Karak International Oil Company (KIO)\nintending to produce 25,000 barrels/day in 2024,\nand Saudi Arabian Corp for Oil Shale (SACOS)\nintending to produce 20,000 barrels/day in 2025.\nThe Field of Nuclear Energy\nConsidering the over committed generating\ncapacity in terms of MW, in the national electric\nsystem, introducing nuclear energy as an\nalternative for electricity generation will be\nconsidered after the year 2030. The Atomic Energy\nCommission is conducting a study to find the best\ntechnology to construct small nuclear reactors in\nseveral locations in Jordan territory, from two to\nsix units with a capacity of 110 MW for each unit.\n3.2.2 Baseline scenario for the transport sector\nA. Sector Policies and Strategies\nA.1 Strategies, policies and plans at the national\nlevel\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No. 89, 2003. Jordan’s Long Term\nNational Transport Strategy and Action Plan set\nout the sector policies and strategies. Key policies\ninclude:\n\nImplementing a multi modal approach to\ninclude rail, with good interconnections\nbetween modes, networks and transport\nservices.\n\nProtecting the environment, by increasing\nthe modal share of low-carbon transport\nmodes, and improving energy efficiency by\npromoting innovative technologies.\n\nProviding a greater degree of accessibility,\nparticularly where current provision of public\ntransport services are poor or inadequate.\nBased on these main policies a number of strategies\nwere developed to achieve the goals set out for\nthe sector. These strategies were adapted to form\nfive alternative scenarios. These were prioritized by\nincorporating Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) results\ninto a Multi-Criteria Analysis framework, which\nconsidered impacts of the scenarios over the six\ncriteria: regional, technical, social, policy, economic\nand financial and environmental.\nThe chosen scenario was the scenario termed\nthe “Environmental Option”. This scenario was\nbuilt (within the strategy) selecting measures\naimed at reducing the impacts of the transport\nsector on the environment (i.e. emissions, effects\nof climate change, noise and land use). In the\n‘Environmental’ Scenario public transport was\ngiven a high priority, with strategies aimed\nat shifting modal shares from private to mass\ntransit. These included improvement of networks,\nincluding the implementation of the Hejaz railway\nalong its entire route from Aqaba to the Syrian\nborder and also setting minimum safety and\nquality standards for public transport vehicles.\nConcerning the road sector, the included strategies\nplaced higher importance on maintenance and\nsafety-enhancing measures for the existing\nnetwork, rather than extensive road-building.\nFurther strategies concerned minimum safety\nand emissions standards for freight vehicles.\nNational Climate Change Policy\nOne of the key national policies that tackled the\nTransport sector was the National Climate Change\nPolicy for Jordan 2013-2020. For the transport\nsector, the policy identified the following strategic\nclimate change objectives:\n\n72\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nTo integrate climate change mitigation\nobjectives and the impact of GHG emissions\ninto transport policies, strategies and action\nplans,\n\nTo promote use of energy efficient, low carbon\ntechnologies, and increase understanding of\ntheir mitigation impact,\n\nTo promote low carbon energy efficient\nmodes of transport.\nThe report also recommended measures to\nachieve the afore-mentioned objectives:\n\nDeveloping\nand\nstrengthening\nlocal\ncapacities in assessment of different transport\nmodes and their mitigation effect,\n\nImproving data collection related to activity\ndata, emissions and emissions factors,\n\nDeveloping Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs).\nIntended Nationally Determined Contributions\n(INDCs)\nIn 2016, Jordan submitted its INDCs to the\nUNFCCC  with the objective of reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. This INDCs Action\nPlan was formally approved by Jordan in August\n2019. The INDCs include mitigation projects for\nthe transport sector including: implementing\na railway system, implementing the bus rapid\ntransit (BRT) nationally, provision of electric car\ncharging stations powered by renewable energy\nand ensuring the inclusion of energy efficiency\nconsiderations in purchase of vehicles. The aim of\nthese projects is to increase the total number of\ncommuters using public transport and reduce total\nvehicle kilometers travelled, fuel consumption,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants\n(More details can be found in Appendix B)\nHighway Master Plan\nThe Ministry of Public Works and Housing\n(MoPWH) carried out its Highway Master Plan\nStudy in 2011. This study provided a timephased road sector development plan up\nto 2030, recommending roads and bridges\nin need of recovery maintenance, including\nimplementation of identified safety measures,\nthe major task identified was the rehabilitation\nof the Desert Highway. Several highways were\nalso recommended for road widening to ease\ncongestion. The study suggested that the\nnetwork was sufficient, but recommended the\nimplementation of a ring road for Amman.\nA.2 Strategies, policies and plans at the subnational level (within GAM)\nAs for Amman city, GAM’s planning document is\nthe 2010 Transport Mobility Master Plan (TMMP),\nwhich has been designed to guide development\nof the transport system within GAM up to 2025.\nThe transport policies developed by GAM in the\nTMMP were based on providing a public Transport\n(PT) system which is accessible and affordable to\nall and encouraging a variety of mobility options\nwhile promoting public transport and walking.\nGAM strategies were developed related to public\ntransport, road safety, pedestrian environment,\nparking, freight, intelligent transport systems (ITS),\ndemand management and the road network.\nStrategies were also developed for the Downtown\nof Amman.\nIn the TMMP twelve scenarios were developed.\nThese scenarios were basically based on the level\nof public transport to be provided (regular bus,\nBRT, light rail) combined with a range of demand\nmanagement measures (soft, medium and\nhard). For GAM the preferred scenario included\nsubstantial investment in high quality public\ntransport services, i.e. bus rapid transit (BRT)\nand light rail, but combined with soft demand\nmanagement.\nTransport and mobility projects have also\nbeen developed within Amman in documents\nseeking to encourage the city’s development in a\nsustainable and environmentally friendly manner.\nThese include:\n\n73\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAmman Resilience Strategy\nThis was developed with the guidance of the\nRockefeller Institute’s 100 resilient cities. As well\nas projects for an integrated mobility plan, BRT\nand metro. The report developed the following\nprojects:\n\nDevelop an urban mobility observatory,\nto enable a data-driven decision-making\napproach,\n\nDevelop, review and update Amman’s street\nmanual to provide guidance to city planners\nto design safe, high standard streets that\nprovide universal and inclusive accessibility\nand promote a walkable environment,\n\nCreate a walking map to show routes between\nneighborhoods,\n\nExplore tactical urbanism opportunities\ni.e. creating opportunities for youth to\nparticipate in the redesign of spaces and\ntemporarily reclaim spaces designated to\ncars,\n\nOrganize a design competition for the area\naround Amman’s Hejaz Railway, to increase\naccess to green spaces in the city.\nAmman Climate Plan, a Vision for 2050\nThis vision document, which was developed\nwith the assistance of the World Bank, sets out a\nseries of projects for transport and mobility. These\ninclude expansion of several of GAM’s projects\nincluding more lanes of BRT, purchasing more\nelectric vehicles to replace vehicles owned by\nGAM and taxis and providing buses with improved\nfuel specifications. In addition, they recommend\nenhancing the efficiency of the city bus network,\nto be addressed as part of the Feeder project.\nAdditionally, the plan recommends the following\nprojects, many of which could be achieved in the\nshort term:\n\nImplementation of a public transportation\nawareness plan to change perceptions and\nbehavior,\n\nCoordination of transit-oriented planning\nwith the planning and transportation\ndepartments,\n\nInstallation of electric vehicle charging\nstations around the city,\n\nImplementation of benefits for zero/low\nemission vehicles, including fast lanes,\nparking discounts, and reduced fees,\n\nInstalling bike paths and other bike safety\nmeasures.\nThe vision document also recommends the\nimprovement of walkability through:\n\nInstallation of new sidewalks,\n\nMaintenance and improvement of existing\nsidewalks,\n\nIncreased green space and tree cover,\n\nIntroduction of pedestrian safety measures.\nGreen City Action Plan\nThis project was launched in 2017 between EBRD\nand GAM to promote sector reforms and develop\npriority projects to modernise infrastructure and\nmunicipal services in Amman.\nThe report is still under development, but it will\nrecommend projects based on the strategic\nobjectives of:\n\nIncreasing the modal share of public\ntransportation,\n\nDeveloping a public realm strategy that\nsupports\npedestrian\ntravel,\n\nIncorporating smart systems in transport\nplanning.\nB. Key Committed Projects\nAmman Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Amman\nZarqa BRT: In these projects, which are currently\nunder construction, buses will be operated in their\nown dedicated lanes. The two systems will be\noperated as one integrated system and will form\nan important backbone for transport in the area.\n\n74\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nThe Amman BRT project will be supported by a\nstudy, to be implemented by GAM, concerning\npublic transport in the area of the Amman BRT.\nThe aim of this study is to advise how to rearrange\nand supplement current public transport services\nin order to support and make ‘best use’ of the\nBRT, by providing ‘feeder’ services to provide\naccess from neighborhoods to BRT stations.\nPotential benefits of these combined projects\nare to improve the image of public transport and\nencourage a mode shift from private vehicles to\nBRT and public transport in general. This mode\nshift from private vehicles to public transport, is\nexpected to produce a reduction in congestion,\nfuel use and emissions of greenhouse gases and\nother pollutants.\n The fuel type of the buses to be purchased is\nstill under consideration. The minimum standard,\nwould be diesel Euro V or Euro VI, but electric\nbuses are still under consideration.\nThe reorganization of the current public transport\nsystem for Amman based on the Feeder Study is\nexpected to lead to a greater number of services\nbeing operated by new BRT buses. This would\nlead to a decrease in emissions, however is not\npossible to estimate the emissions savings until\nreorganization of public transport networks has\nbeen agreed.\nProposed Update of TMMP: A comprehensive\nlist of proposed projects is laid out in the TMMP\nto support the strategies identified by GAM for\ntransport in the city. However, it is considered\nthat the next step for GAM should be to carry\nout an update of the TMMP, since the previous\nstudy is now 10 years old and there have been\nconsiderable changes in the city, in particular a\nlarge growth in population. This would enable the\npolicies and strategies to be set out for mobility in\nGAM for the next 15 years, with the aim of guiding\nAmman city into development while considering\nenergy efficiency and sustainability. One of the\nexpected outcomes of the project is a roadmap\nfor future growth in mobility in GAM with clear\npriorities given to proposed projects.\nThe Data Warehouse Project: this project is\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, with the\npurpose of collecting, storing, processing and\ndistribution of data concerning the transport\nsector. This should motivate the use of data by\ndecision makers at all levels. Potential benefits\ninclude the use of trends analysis to make\nestimates for the future and use of previous\nexperience in future planning.\nPublic Transport Restructuring Project for\nGovernorates: Projects are planned to restructure\nthe urban public transport systems of Irbid, Zarqa\nand Madaba with the aim of developing reliable\npublic transport systems and improving the level\nof services for citizens. Potential benefits are to\npromote a mode shift to public transport trips,\nfrom private vehicle trips, with a subsequent\nreduction in congestion, fuel use and emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants.\nIntelligent Transport Systems Project (ITS): The\naim of this project is to develop and operate ITS\nto monitor and control public transport services,\nand to provide an integrated electronic payment\nsystem. This has been implemented in GAM as\na pilot project with the new buses for Amman\nVision introduced in 2019. Potential benefit is\nin adding convenience for passengers, helping\nto promote mode shift from private vehicles to\npublic transport.\nAmman, Salt and Irbid Ring Roads: Salt and\nIrbid ring roads are currently under construction.\nAmman ring road, Phase 1, also known as Amman\nDevelopment Corridor is already completed.\nFeasibility and Environmental Studies, as well as\ndetailed designs have been carried out for the\nremaining sections. Potential benefits of these\nprojects are to relieving traffic congestion in the\ncities, particularly from truck traffic and improve\naccess to areas on the outskirts of the city.\n\n75\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAirport Projects: Air travel connections to\nJordan are vital to Jordan’s economic growth.\nProjects have been proposed to accommodate\nin future increasing passenger numbers,\nthrough expansion at Amman Civil Airport and\nKing Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nImplementation of a further airport has also been\nsuggested. Potential benefits of these projects are\npredominantly economic, but are also important\nfor accessibility.\nProjects concerning freight: In order to\nevaluate the GHG mitigation effect of freight\nprojects, concerning use of different modes\nof transportation, emissions factors from the\ndifferent modes published by Department of the\nEnvironment, Fisheries & Rural Affairs (Defra), UK\nhave been compared. The lowest emissions from\nfreight transport are for cargo ship, followed by\nfreight rail services, and therefore these would\nbe the best options for freight to and within the\ncountry. Transporting freight by air, either within\nthe country or into the country has the largest\nemissions factors, and therefore road freight is\nto be preferred to air freight.\nASEZA Rail Freight Project: Feasibility and\ntechnical studies are being undertaken for the\ndevelopment of a railway connecting a planned\nland port at Ma’an with port facilities around\nAqaba. Potential benefits are to encourage mode\nshift for freight between Aqaba and Ma’an from\nroad to rail, leading to a reduction in congestion,\nand emissions of greenhouse gases and other\npollutants.\nMoT National Railway Project: The aim is to\nestablish a freight railway network. The railway\nbetween Aqaba and Ma’an forms the first part\nof this plan. The remainder of the project is still\nin need of funding. Potential benefits are to\nencourage mode shift for freight around the\ncountry and to/from neighboring countries from\ntrucks to railway with an expected reduction in\ncongestion and emissions from greenhouse gases\nand other pollutants.\nC. Future Trends in Transport Sector\nIn the short term (around 5 years) there are\nmany projects being implemented, which will\nhave a large effect on transport in Jordan. The\nBRT network for Amman and between Zarqa and\nAmman should be operational in 2021, with a\nmodern comfortable bus fleet. The reorganization\nand restructuring of public transport services in\nAmman, Zarqa, Irbid and Madaba, should also\nhave been carried out, with implementation of ITS\ntechnology on all buses. Additionally, walkability\nin Amman is already being improved, with the\nrehabilitation of areas along the BRT lines currently\nunder construction by GAM.\nThese projects and improvements are expected\nto encourage a mode shift in trips from private\nvehicles to public transport as it is made more\nconvenient and comfortable. This is expected to\nlead to a reduction in congestion and a decrease\nin fuel use, with a corresponding drop in emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants. These\nprojects may additionally be copied by other\ngovernorates and within Amman, where there is\npotential for further lines of BRT and improvements\nin walking infrastructure. The data warehouse\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, would be\na source of data and information concerning all\ntransport projects, which could be made available\nto interested organisations.\nThe MoPWH is expected to have completed\nnecessary rehabilitation of the Desert Highway,\nand carried out widening and rehabilitation of\nroads, as identified in the 2011 Highways Master\nPlan. This would lead to improved journey times\nand reduced congestion, which would lead\nto more efficient operations for road freight\ntransport.\nGAM’s TMMP Update Project should have been\ncompleted\nproviding\nimportant\nguidance\nconcerning the priority for projects in the transport\nsector within the city.\nIt is expected to have more electric cars on the\nroads of Amman, purchased by GAM and by the\npublic, as they are shown to be efficient for city-\n\n76\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nuse and as fuel stations and destinations in the\ncity provide more charging stations.\nIn the medium term (around 10 years) larger\ninfrastructure projects committed by the\nGovernment of Jordan should have been\nimplemented. These are expected to include the\npipeline project between Jordan and Iraq and the\nrailway project between Aqaba and Ma’an. These\ntwo projects would remove a large number of\ntruck vehicle kms from the network, since trips\nby oil trucks to Zarqa from Amman and Iraq, and\ntrips by freight lorries between Amman and Aqaba\nare expected to be largely replaced by trips by\npipeline or rail.\nWork on Amman Civil Airport and King Hussein\nInternational Airport, are expected to have been\ncompleted, allowing greater passenger trips and\nboosting tourist numbers and economic growth\nin the country.\nRing roads around Amman, Salt and Irbid should\nhave been completed, improving accessibility for\nareas around these cities and reducing congestion\nin the city centres. Stronger legislation will have\nbeen possible for trucks to keep them out of the\nurban areas of these cities, now suitable alternative\nroutes have been provided, reducing congestion,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants.\nKey projects for the longer term include the\nNational Rail Network, which would connect with\nthe railway from Aqaba at Ma’an. This is expected\nto carry a large proportion of the freight across\nJordan, which would provide savings in terms of\nreducing Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) on the\nroad network, with a reduction in congestion, fuel\nuse, GHG emissions and other pollutants. Metro\nfor Amman could also have been implemented.\nAdditionally, it is expected to have projects for\nGAM, as prioritized through the TMMP Update\nproject. Potentially these could include a tram for\nDowntown Amman, and light rail from Amman\nto Queen Alia International Airport.\n3.2.3 Baseline scenario for the industrial\nprocess sector\nIndustry is a significant contributor to Jordan’s\nGDP, directly contributing about 24% to the\nnational Gross Domestic Product (GDP), during\n2017.\nIndustry in Jordan is divided into two main types;\nmanufacturing sector, including the production\nof cement, lime, fertilizers and chemicals, and the\nmining and quarrying sector, including quarrying\nof limestone.\nJordan’s industrial sector is increasingly affected by\nregional circumstances; exports to Iraq and Syria\ndecreased because of the increasing difficulties of\ntransportation and trade across the north-eastern\nand northern borders and the land routes to the\nMediterranean. Moreover, the industrial sector is\nfacing new challenges due to COVID-19 pandemic\nin 2020, i.e. Cement production has decreased due\nto Lockdown, and particularly periods of curfew\nthat have slowed down operations significantly.\nThe government has focused on developing\nthe industrial sector, through attracting foreign\ninvestment, privatization of public establishments\nand providing customs and tax exemptions\nfor investment projects within the different\nsectors, particularly the mining sector. However,\nGovernment policies should take into account the\nafore-mentioned industry circumstances.\nThere are laws and regulations that encourage\nand protect the capital investment such as Jordan\nInvestment Law No. 30 of 2014. However, current\nJordanian laws and regulations do not directly\ncontrol CO2 and other GHG emissions from\nindustrial processes. For example, the Jordanian\nlegally binding standards (JS 1189/2006)\nconcerning the quantity and quality of emissions\nfrom stationary sources such as the industrial\nprocesses has no specific threshold value for CO2\nand GHG emissions.\nThe following are the governmental policies,\nstrategies and plans relevant to the industrial\nsector:\n\n77\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe Ministry of Industry Trade and Supply\ndeveloped an industrial policy (2017 – 2021)\nto enhance the competitiveness of the\nindustrial sector, increase its contribution to\neconomic development, enable it to increase\nits exports to traditional and new markets,\nand increase the investment through an\neffective partnership with the private sector,\n\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021)\nincludes the establishment of a fund to\nsupport and finance industrial development\nin order to finance projects resulting from the\nindustrial policy, reduce the operational costs\non the industrial sector through motivating\nthe use of alternative energy sources,\nproviding technical and financial support\nto industrial companies, and developing\ninfrastructure and regulatory procedures for\nthe transport sector in all modes serving the\nindustrial activities,\n\nThe National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020)\nsingled out a major thrust for the state of\nproduction which includes a number of\nnational priorities and projects related to the\nindustry and commerce sectors and small\nand medium enterprises. These priorities and\nprojects aim to increase productivity, increase\ngrowth in Jordan’s economy and generate\ndecent job opportunities for Jordanians,\n\nBylaw No. 13/2020 includes a set of standards\nand criteria that must be achieved for the\nindustrial sector, including supporting the\ndevelopment of this sector, increasing its\ncompetitiveness in foreign markets and\nproviding job opportunities for Jordanians.\nListed below are the main plans/activities of\nthe government to improve the industrial\nperformance of Jordan:\n\nEnhance the competitiveness of the industrial\nsector and increase its export potential to\ntraditional and new markets,\n\nImproving the quality of local products and\nadapting them to international specifications.\n\nProviding job opportunities for all Jordanians,\nincluding female workers and people with\ndisabilities,\n\nIncrease confidence in the industrial sector\nand support the development of this sector\nto effectively contribute to economic\ndevelopment of the country,\n\nAllow the lease of treasury lands in the\ngovernorates for the purpose of establishing\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by the\ngovernorates citizens, according to specific\ncontrols and standards,\n\nReduce the operational costs of the\nindustrial sector through motivating the\nuse of alternative energy sources, providing\ntechnical and financial support to industrial\ncompanies, and developing infrastructure\nand regulatory procedures for the transport\nsector for all modes serving industrial\nactivities,\n\nImprove the investment environment, in\norder to attract foreign investments to all\nthe governorates,\n\nImprove the required infrastructure of\nservices needed for industrial activities,\n\nReduce the gap between the output of\neducation and vocational training and the\nneeds of the labor market and provide the\nnecessary support, in order to build the\ncapacities of workers in the industrial sector,\n\nEnhance the communication between\ntechnical research and development entities\nand industries in order to improve knowledge\nconcerning\nuse\nof\nnew\ntechniques/\ntechnologies,\n\nEnhance the adoption of Best Available\nTechnology (BAT) and Best Environmental\nPractices (BEP) in the industrial processes,\n\nImprove regulations and policies in order to\nencourage industrial investment,\n\nEnhance cooperation between the private\nand public sectors,\n\n78\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nEstablish a national strategy to improve the\nexport of local products to the international\nmarket,\n\nImprove the financial support mechanism\nto incentivise industrial investments,\n\nProvide technical support to the industries\nin order to comply with technical and\nenvironmental standards and enhance\ntheir participation in setting standards and\ndecision-making.\n3.2.4 Baseline scenario for the waste sector\nJordan is shifting towards more sustainable\nsolid waste management systems and trying to\nintroduce more innovative options to tackle the\nchallenge of solid waste management, especially\nwith the high pressure exerted on its system with\nthe flux of refugees as a result of the Syrian crisis\nin recent years. Efforts made by the Ministry of\nEnvironment resulted in the adoption of The Solid\nWaste Framework Law, which aims at producing\ngood governance in the waste sector. The Ministry\nof Local Administration also adopted the National\nStrategy in 2015, which diagnoses most of the\nproblems the waste management system suffers\nfrom. Some of the problems and weaknesses\nidentified by the strategy are: low operational\nefficiency of municipalities and Joint Services\nCouncils, lack of information, low sanitation level\nat landfills (except Ghabawi), low level of recycling,\nfew projects for waste to energy and composting\nactivities.\nThe new solid waste management framework\nlaw which came into force in September 2020\nwill organise the solid waste sector in Jordan for\nthe coming years and will provide the basis for\nbetter solid waste management.\nThe per capita solid waste generation rate is\ncurrently around 1kg/capita/day for urban areas\nin Jordan and is expected to continue increasing\nin the coming years with urbanization, reduction\nof family size and with increase in income. Waste\nin rural areas will mostly continue to increase but\nat a higher rate than in urban areas.\nFunds from international agencies contributed\nto upgrading the solid waste infrastructure. The\nupgrade in solid waste infrastructure such as\nintroduction of more solid waste transfer stations\nwill improve the system capacity and will also\nimprove the financial situation of municipalities\nespecially medium and large ones.\nAlso,\nsome\ndonors\nhave\nstarted\nwaste\nmanagement programs such as waste sorting\nfacilities and composting at some landfills and\nwithin refugees camps. The unstable recyclables\nmarket still hinders the sustainability of the waste\nreduction and recycling programs as they still do\nnot meet their monetary- economic feasibility.\nComposting will continue to be unfeasible unless\nit is adopted as governmental policy for waste\nreduction.\nPrivate Public Partnership (PPP) in solid waste\nactivities in Jordan is still weak and needs to be\nimproved even though there are some good\nexamples in Aqaba, Zarqa, and Petra. Awareness\nof public and vocational training of solid waste\nworkers still needs to be improved more with\nfocus on introducing key performance indicators\nfor waste collection systems and workers at\nmunicipality level. Improvements expected in\nsolid waste management will not be sustainable\nunless an information management system is\nadopted at all levels.\nThe economic success along with good\ngovernance in solid waste management are the\nmost important. It is also important to achieve\ndecoupling between GDP and waste generation\nwhich is not an easy task. Success in decoupling\nis ensured by effective awareness raising, waste\nreduction programs, waste recycling and reuse\nand application of resource efficiency and cleaner\nproduction principles in industry.\nClimate change is expected to impact both waste\ngeneration rate and waste decomposition rate.\nReduced cloud cover, as one of the climate change\nfeatures, adversely impacts the life of exposed\nmaterial resulting in more waste generation.\nIn general, the rate of population growth in Jordan\nhas been declining since the 1950’s except during\n\n79\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nexceptional circumstances, such as the Gulf War,\nwhere population increased by 10.3% and 6.72% in\n1990 and 1991 respectively. The strategy suggests\nthat the decrease in population growth rate will\ncontinue and may reach around 1.26 % in 2040.\nIn reality, the growth rate will not continue to\ndecrease, but would reach a fixed value of around\n2.1% as the growth rate of population is greatly\naffected by religious belief, social circumstances\nand economic situation. As such, the solid waste\nquantities generated will continue to increase, but\nwith a lower rate if only dependent on population\nincrease, and disregarding other factors. This is in\nline with the assumption of the national strategy\nthat assumes a 2.04% increase rate for urban areas\nand 1.02 % increase rate for rural areas. According\nto the strategy, by 2039 solid waste from urban\nareas will reach 1.64 and from rural areas 1.112\nkg/capita/day.\nHowever, in reality the waste generated per\ncapita is not expected to continue increasing\nand it should reach some stagnant point (noting\nthat Jordan is an upper middle income country\naccording to World Bank classification and is not\nexpected to become a high income country in\nthe foreseeable future).\nWaste composition is an important aspect for\nsuccessful environmental policies and good\nwaste management programs. Many solid waste\ncomposition studies have been performed\nin Jordan at different levels, most of them to\nanalyse waste received at landfills and others\nbased on samples at initial disposal points. It can\nbe concluded from all the studies that organic\nwaste seems to be the main component of the\nmunicipal solid waste, in addition to packaging\nwaste, which seems to be significant mostly in\nurban areas. Waste composition is not fixed and\ncould be changed based on different limiting\nfactors such as socioeconomic conditions,\nurbanization, etc. As Jordan accepts waves of\nrefugees from nearby countries, these incoming\npeople may have different social behaviors that\naffect waste composition at country level, but no\nspecific studies have been conducted to study\nthis impact. Also, unforeseen events affect waste\ncomposition, such as the current COVID 19 crisis\nwhich immediately resulted in an increase in\nplastic waste in the form of gloves and masks.\nBut this crisis may result in permanent changes in\nwaste composition such as increasing packaging\nwaste as a result of a change in social behavior,\nas people start ordering more online products.\nIn conclusion, waste quantities will continue to\nincrease with time in Jordan in the short and\nmedium term. To reach decoupling between\nwaste generation and economic growth, robust\npolicies need to be applied. Waste composition\nwill continue to change as the urbanization rate\nincreases, family size decreases, GDP increases and\nbased on other related factors.\n3.2.5 Baseline scenario for the AFOLU sector\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nis unique among all sectors, since its mitigation\npotential is based on both an enhancement of\nremovals of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as\nreduction of emissions through management\nof land and livestock. The AFOLU sector is\nresponsible for around a quarter of the annual\nGHG emissions resulting mainly from deforestation\nand agricultural emissions from livestock, soil\nand nutrient management. Opportunities for\nmitigation include both the supply-side and\ndemand side options as well as forests which are\nconsidered important carbon pools.\nPolicies governing practices in agriculture and\nin forest conservation and management need\nto account for both mitigation and adaptation.\nAnthropogenic\nland-use\nactivities\n(e.g.,\nmanagement of croplands, forests, grasslands,\nwetlands), and changes in land use/cover (e.g.,\nconversion of forest lands and grasslands to\ncropland and pasture, afforestation) cause\nchanges superimposed on natural carbon fluxes.\nLand is the critical resource for the AFOLU sector.\nIt provides food and fodder and it provides\nlivelihoods for people. Human economies and\nquality of life are directly dependent on the\nservices and the resources provided by land.\n\n80\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nIn Jordan, the natural ecosystems support human\nactivities in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,\ntourism, traditional and pharmaceutical health\nproducts, and traditional medicine, among others.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, less than\n5% of the country’s total area is arable land and\n90% is grazing land with 100-200 mm annual\nrainfall. Natural and human-made forests cover\naround 1% of the country’s area. The contribution\nof agriculture to the GDP in relative terms declined\nsharply from 40% in the 1950s to 4% in 2016.\nIrrespective of how humble the contribution of\nagriculture is to GDP and economic performance,\nfarming remains important. The importance of\nthe agricultural sector stems from the fact that\nit is not only a major source of food, particularly\ndairy products, fruits and vegetables, but it is also\na source of livelihood for 25% of the total poor\npopulation (livestock keepers, smallholder farm\nhouseholds, and landless former agriculturalists)\nliving in rural areas.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)\nstatistics 11% of the total country area is used\nas agriculture land and less than 1 % is forests\n(MoA, Annual Report, 2018). The country has three\ndistinguished bioclimatic zones namely:\n\nThe Jordan Valley, which forms a narrow strip\nthat is situated below the mean sea level with\nwarm winters and hot summers and where\nirrigation is practiced,\n\nThe western highlands, where annual\nprecipitation is in the range of 300 to 600\nmm,\n\nThe “Badia”, which includes the arid and semiarid areas in the eastern parts of the country,\nwhere the annual rainfall is below 200 mm.\nBadia is an Arabic word describing the open\nrangeland inhibited by Bedouins (nomads).\nAvailable governmental plans, programs, policies,\nand strategies announced and published by the\nMinistry of Agriculture, the Directorate of Forests,\nand other relevant institutions were reviewed.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture has just recently\npublished the 2020-2025 National Agricultural\nDevelopment Strategy focusing on the digitization\nand restructuring of the sector and boosting its\nproductivity.\nThe strategy identified a total of 174 interventions\nand projects that will be financed through a host\nof channels, including the Treasury; from the\nAgricultural Credit Corporation and from foreign\naid and grants.\nThe strategy has the following ambitious\nobjectives:\n\nIncreasing the agricultural GDP as a share\nof total GDP from 2.6 billion JD now to 3.66\nbillion JD by 2025 and boosting the addedvalue of agriculture to 2.48 billion JD from\n1.6 billion JD,\n\nIncreasing the forest area by 10% by 2025,\n\nExpanding pasture areas,\n\nCreating 65,000 jobs in the five-year period\nand replacing 21,000 foreign workers with\nJordanians,\n\nIncrease the number of farmers using digital\ngovernment-run agricultural services by 30\nper cent,\n\nReducing export costs to facilitate a 15 per\ncent increase in agricultural exports,\n\nIncrease the productivity of food and\nagricultural manufacturers by 18 per cent\nby 2025,\n\nThe utilization of modern technology to\nenhance production and productivity,\nfocusing on strategic crops,\nThe policy will address, as well, a number of\nchallenges facing the agricultural sector, among\nwhich:\n\nThe lack of comprehensive agricultural\ndatabases and poor utilization of modern\ntechnologies in agriculture that limited the\nagricultural producer’s access to retailers and\nconsumers,\n\n81\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nMarketing of products with the closure\nof neighboring markets due to regional\nconditions and the need to facilitate export\nof agricultural products through the Queen\nAlia International Airport (QAIA), \n\nLack of refrigerator trucks to transport fruit\nand vegetables ready for exporting,\n\nCompensating farmers for the damage to\ncrops because of frost,\n\nThe high cost of electricity for the agricultural\nsector,\n\nThe need to better manage the issue of nonJordanian workers in the sector, \n\nThe need to support livestock breeders with\nfeed, medicine and vaccines,\n\nIncrease in fodder prices due to delay and\ndecrease of rainfall.\nConsistent with these plans, the following is\nprojected as the baseline for AFOLU:\n\nField crops production: Increase productivity\nper unit area, promote water harvesting\ntechniques to expand planting areas, and\nmaintain productivity under predicted\ndecrease in rainfall,\n\nAnimal production: Promote high productive\nanimal species, under increase in prices of\nfodder, and other production inputs\n\nFodder\nproduction:\nReclamation\nof\nrangelands and control of overgrazing of\nrangelands, introduce species with high\nproductivity under drought conditions\nand promote wastewater reuse in fodder\nproduction,\n\nForestry conservation: Maintain forests which\nare threatened by predicted drought cycles,\nurban and rural expansion, expected fire\noccurrences, and illegal deforestation.\n3.3 Updates on the FBUR Mitigation Measures\nfor Different Sectors\nAccording to Annex III of Decision 2/CP.17 related to\nthe guidelines for the preparation of national BURs,\nnon-annex I parties should provide information,\nin a tabular format, on actions to mitigate climate\nchange, by addressing anthropogenic emissions\nby sources and removals by sinks of all GHGs not\ncontrolled by the Montreal Protocol.\nIn the preparation of this chapter of Jordan’s SBUR,\nall mitigation projects included in the FBUR have\nbeen reviewed and assessed to identify those\noptions considered to be still valid and applicable.\nThe cost-benefit analysis and the CO2 emissions\nreduction have been updated for each valid\nmitigation project. Net present value was used\nin the financial calculations, by converting all\npresent and future revenues and costs over the\nlifetime of the project to a base of today’s cost.\nThe same approach was followed in calculating\nCO2 emissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nproposed projects. A discount rate of 8% was used\nin all calculations of cost and emissions reduction.\nThe discounted unit cost of reduced emissions\nwhich is the quotient of the discounted cost to\nthe discounted emissions reduction was also\ncalculated.\nThe updated mitigation measures include GHG\nmitigation projects in the following areas:\n\nPrimary energy,\n\nRenewable energy,\n\nEnergy efficiency,\n\nIndustrial processes,\n\nWaste,\n\nAgriculture and forestry.\nThe results of the mitigation measures update is\npresented in the following sub-sections.\n3.3.1 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor primary energy\nThe GHG mitigation measures in the primary\nenergy demand and supply that were considered\nin the FBUR have been reviewed and assessed.\nAll information is presented in a tabular format\nin Appendix A, Table A.1. Table 3.4 is a summary\nof the FBUR mitigation projects and their current\nstatus.\n\n82\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.4: Status of the primary energy mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution Network\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nDemand Side Management\nCanceled from NEPCO’s implementation plan\nsince the different components of the project\nwill be implemented by JREEEF/MEMR through\nits Action Plan.\nAdding a 100 MW Combined Cycle in Samra\nPower Plant\nImplemented. It was modified to 70 MW instead\nof 100 MW and completely implemented by the\nyear 2018. According to the modification, the\ntotal estimated GHG emission reduction is 2066\nthousand tonnes CO2eq (kt CO2eq) during 25\nyears from 2018- 2043. The estimated emission\nreduction unit cost is - 33.77 JD/tonne of CO2eq.\nThus, the following two primary energy projects\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. The two mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution (T&D) Network, This project seeks\nto reduce the transmission and distribution\nlosses to 9% in 2027 compared to 13.3% in\n2020. The project will be executed gradually\nover a period of 6 years starting in 2022.\nThe main components of the project will\nbe optimizing the utilization of distributed\ngeneration, improving the system power\nfactor, upgrading or replacing existing\nconductors and insulators with lowerresistance equipment. The cost is estimated\nto be 48 Million USD. This project can lead to a\nsignificant reduction in fuel consumption and\nas a result a discounted emission reduction\nof 1,956 thousand tonnes of CO2 through the\n25 years, lifetime of the project (2022-2047),\n\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa, and Aqaba, According to the energy\nstrategy 2020-2030, Jordan will enhance\nthe usage of natural gas in all sectors such\nas Industrial, Residential, Commercial and\nTransportation. This includes the use of natural\ngas instead of liquefied petroleum gas for\ncooking, diesel in central heating and water\nheating and gasoline for cars. In 2020, 86%\nof the electricity generation of the Kingdom\nis generated from imported natural gas. To\ndeliver natural gas to smaller customers it will\nbe necessary to construct new low-pressure\ngas distribution networks to connect\ncustomers to the new infrastructure.\n The project will be executed gradually over\n10 years, starting in 2025 and with a capital\ncost of 110 million USD.\n Natural gas combustion emits 1.3 times less\nCO2 than that of oil, which indicates that\nusing natural gas in demand side sector as an\nalternative for diesel, fuel oil, LPG and gasoline,\nwill mitigate a significant quantity of CO2\nemissions. Using the natural gas distribution\nnetworks in the main cities of Amman, Zarqa,\nand Aqaba will mitigate about 2,708 thousand\ntonnes of CO2eq discounted emissions in the\n25 years of the project lifetime (2025-2050).\n The costs and CO2 emissions reduction for the\ntwo valid projects have been analyzed. Table\n3.5 shows a summary of the results.\n\n83\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.5: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne CO2eq) for the\nprimary energy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emission reductions\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission\nand Distribution Network\n1,956\n- 108.52\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\n2,708\n-13.78\n3.3.2 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor renewable energy (RE)\nRenewable energy (RE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed. All information is presented\nin a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.2. Table\n3.6 is a summary of their current status.\nTable 3.6: Status of RE mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\nSolar Water Heaters 2-30,000 Houses\nImplemented in four stages by JREEEF/MEMR during\nthe period 2017-2020.\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. Postponed to\nstart in the year 2022 instead of 2020.\n120 MW PV – Wheeling and Net Metering\nImplemented by MEMR during the period 2017-2020.\nThus, the following three renewable energy\nprojects are still valid and moved from FBUR to\nbe updated and considered in this SBUR. The three\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nConcentrating solar power (CSP) systems\nwork by concentrating the sun’s rays using\nmirrors to create heat, then the created heat\nis transferred to a heat transfer fluid. Electricity\nis then generated in a steam cycle, using the\nheat transfer fluid to create steam and generate\nelectricity as in conventional thermal power\nplants.\nConcentrated solar plants today typically include\nlow-cost thermal storage systems to decouple\ngeneration from the sun. Most commonly, a twotank molten salt storage system is used. CSP\nsystems are classified into line concentrating\nand focal concentrating systems referring to\nthe arrangements of concentrating mirrors.\nThe most widely deployed linear concentrating\nsystems are parabolic trough collectors while\nsolar towers are the most widely deployed focal\n\n84\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nconcentrating systems. It is expected that the\nconcentrated technology will play a major role\nin producing electricity with an increasing use\nof thermal storage to utilize excess heat during\nnight time to ensure the continuity of power\nproduction.\nThe capital cost of CSP represented by the\nunit cost of kW is decreasing with time. The\nreported global weighted- average cost of\nCSP commissioned in 2019 was USD 5,774/\nkW which is 36% lower than in 2010. Also,\nthe capacity factor increased to reach 45% in\n2019 with storage capacities from 4 to 8 hours.\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) costs that\ninclude insurance, and receivers and mirrors\nreplacements are substantial compared to solar\nPV and onshore wind energy but these costs\nare also declining with time. The typical costs\nof O&M of plants in operation today are in the\nrange of USD 0.02/kWh to USD 0.04/kWh (REVE\nmagazine, 2020).\nThe proposed capacity of this project will be\n100 MW and its capital cost, O&M costs, and\ncapacity factor are assumed to be the same as\nthose reported in 2019. The estimated annual\nelectricity production is around 394,200,000\nkWh and the capital cost is around 410 million\nJD. The estimated total discounted emission\nreduction is 1929.37 thousand tonnes CO2eq\nduring the 25 years of the project lifetime (20232047).\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nThis project is expected to be constructed in\n2028. In 2028, it is expected that the capital cost\nof CSP technology will decline by time and will\nreach 4,000 USD/kW while capacity factor will\nincrease to reach 70%. O&M cost is assumed\nto decrease to 0.01 USD/kW. The proposed\ncapacity of this project will be 300 MW with\nan estimated annual electricity production of\naround 1,708,200,000 kWh and a capital cost\nof around million JD 840. The estimated total\ndiscounted emission reduction is 9,003.71\nthousand tonnes CO2eq during the 25 years of\nthe project lifetime (2028-2052).\nSolar Water Heaters 3 – 30,000 houses\nThis mitigation project is similar to the previous\nsolar water heaters (SWH) projects which were\nproposed earlier in TNC and FBUR and were\nsuccessfully implemented by JREEEF/MEMR\nthroughout 2017-2020. This proposed project\nis planned to be implemented over three years\n2022- 2025 with a lifetime of 25 years 2022-2046.\nSWH saves electric energy used to heat water\nfor domestic use. It is assumed that SWH will\nreplace electric heaters and every house requires\na solar water heater of 4.6 m2 and every m2 can\nproduce around 740 kWh/yr. This proposed\nproject includes the installation of 30,000 solar\nwater heaters; the cost of each is 500 JD. The\ninstalled capacity of this project will be 54 MW\nwith an estimated annual electricity reduction of\naround 102 GWh. The estimated total discounted\nemission reduction is 457.53 thousand tonnes\nCO2eq during the 25 years of the project lifetime\n(2022-2046).\nThe cost and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nthree valid renewable energy projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.7.\nTable 3.7: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for renewable\nenergy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions reduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n1,929.37\n118.68\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n9,003.71\n- 7.18\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\n457.51\n-189.95\n\n85\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.3 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor energy efficiency (EE)\nEnergy Efficiency (EE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed.

The four mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed\nwater tanks in food industry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, condensate resulting from the\n\n86\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\ncondensation of steam is drained without the\nutilization of its heat. Therefore, returning this\ncondensate to the boiler feed water tank will\nsave energy represented by the saved heavy\nfuel oil to operate the boiler in addition to\nsaving in the cost of water treatment and\nwater itself. It is assumed that 10 food factories\nwill implement this energy efficiency measure\nwith a discounted emission reduction of\n7,433.38 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fitting and tanks\nin food industries.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, the steam and condensate\npipes and valves, and feed water tank are\nuninsulated. Insulating them will save energy\nin the form of saved fuel used to power the\nsteam boiler. It is assumed that 10 food\nfactories will implement this energy efficiency\nmeasure with a discounted emission reduction\nof 8,243.32 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 new houses.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented in\nthree years starting from 2022 with a lifetime\nof 30 years. It is assumed that 80% of new\nresidential houses are not insulated, so out\nof 3,500 checked houses it is assumed that\nthe insulation of walls and roofs will have\nbeen implemented for 2,800 houses. It is also\nassumed that the saving from this measure is\nabout 50% of the annual heating and cooling\nbills in these houses. It is estimated that this\nenergy efficiency measure will result in a\ndiscounted emission reduction of 69,792.85\ntonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the project\n(2022-2051).\n\nUsing Regenerative Burners Instead of\nConventional Burners in Steel Reheating\nIndustry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 20 years. In steel\nfactories, the reheating furnace uses heavy\nfuel oil to reheat the steel billets, usually to\nform the steel into construction steel rods.\nHigh speed pressure jet burners are used\nfor this purpose. Using regenerative burners\ninstead of these conventional burners will\nresult in energy saving of around 10%. It is\nestimated that implementing this energy\nefficiency measure in 5 steel factories will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n72,093.67 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2041).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed EE projects have been analyzed. A\nsummary of the results is shown in Table 3.9.\nTable 3.9: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nenergy efficiency mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions\nreduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water\ntanks in food industries\n7.43\n-108.04\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fittings, and tanks in\nfood industries\n8.24\n-215.16\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3500 new houses\n69.79\n-183.64\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional\nburners in steel reheating industries\n72.09\n-110.03\n\n87\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.4 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures for IPPU sector\nGHG mitigation options in the IPPU sector that were considered in the FBUR report have been reviewed\nand assessed. Relevant information is presented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.4. Table 3.10\nis a summary of their status.\nTable 3.10: Status of the IPPU mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the\nraw materials needed to produce clinker\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\ncement\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nof Pozzolana\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nUse of biomass (MSW or/and Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the nitric acid plant\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for IPPU\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. These mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute\nthe raw materials needed to produce clinker\nat the selected cement plant\nCertain steel slag and fly ash materials (decarbonated kiln feedstock) could be added to the\nraw material feed to reduce the amount of raw\nmaterial needed to produce a given amount of\nclinker. Jordan has more than 5 steel melting and\ngalvanizing factories, therefore there is an available\nstock of steel slag and fly ash to be used in the\ncement industry.\nIn this mitigation project, it is suggested to produce\na new type of cement CEM V (Composite Cement)\nat one of the cement industries; mainly the one that\nhas a neighboring steel manufacturing company\nand can try the production of this type of cement\nwith minor additional costs in comparison to\nother existing companies. The percentages of\nblast-furnace slag and natural Pozzolana range\nbetween 31-49% each, to produce CEM V/B. A\n40% substitution of steel slag/fly ash and a 10%\nproduction of new CEM V/B will be assumed at\nthis company.\nThe price of steel slag and/or fly ash is estimated\nto be 42.3 JD/tonne. The cost of energy and raw\nmaterials reach 61% of total cost and based on\nthe assumption of a production cost of 89.7 JD/\ntonne of cement. This option will reduce the cost\nby 54.7 JD/tonne of cement. No annual increase\nin the production costs will be assumed for the\nproject lifetime. Investment cost to grind the steel\nslag will be estimated as 2,442,928 JD (based on\nthe maximum produced tonnes of CEM II in 2046)\nbased on the estimated cost of 1.37 USD/tonne\ncement.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 250,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022 - 2046)\n\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in\n\nCEM II\nBlended cement is a mixture of clinker and additives\ncontaining less than 95% clinker. Blended cement\ntypes are distinct products with different uses\nthat have different additives and different shares\nof clinker. More than 90% of cement produced at\nthe local cement companies is CEM II (Portland–\nPozzolana Cement) with a percentage of Pozzolana\n\n88\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nranges between 21-32%. Therefore; there is an area\nto increase the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\nby improving the reactivity of the produced clinker\nand the raw mix to produce CEM II/B-P to achieve\nthe required strength of 42.5N that cause the use\nof Pozzolana of less than 32% (the 3% is substituted\nby gypsum). A reasonable 2% more substitution\ncould be assumed on average and so a reduction\nof CO2 emissions by 2% could be assumed as well.\nSince all local cement companies produce CEM\nII, there is no need for investment to procure the\nequipment needed to receive, store, grind and\nmeter.\nPozzolana to the cement product. The operational\ncost includes the price of extraction of Pozzolana,\npaid to MEMR (previously payment was to the\nNatural Resources Authority) and transportation.\nHowever, this option will reduce the cost of raw\nmaterials (mainly limestone) and energy needed to\nproduce the saved clinker that will be substituted\nby Pozzolana.\nThe price of Pozzolana is estimated to be 36.6 JD/\ntonne. As mentioned above, this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement to save both\nenergy and raw materials and no extra investment\ncost is needed.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, it is\nexpected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is assumed\nto be 25 years.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 367,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022-2046)\n\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with\n45% of Pozzolana\nIt is estimated that 10% of currently produced CEM\nII/B-P will be changed to CEM IV, strength 22.5X in\nwhich the Pozzolana substitution will reach 45% (at\nleast 13% more (starting from approximately 32%).\nCO2 reduction will be calculated by multiplying the\nannual CO2 emissions by the reduced percentage of\n13%, this percentage will also be multiplied by the\npercentage of the products that will be converted\nfrom CEM II/B-P to CEM IV which is assumed to be\n10% of CEM II/B-P. Therefore; annual CO2 emissions\nfrom producing CEM II/B-P will be multiplied by\n1.3% to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction as\na result of implementing this option.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, marketing\nthe new product, and setting the legally binding\nregulations and enforcement measures to control\nits use, it is expected to start the implementation of\nthis project in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\nto be 25 years. The price of Pozzolana is estimated\nto be 36.6 JD/tonne and also this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement by savings in\nboth energy and raw materials, and with no extra\ninvestment. It is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 238,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nUse of biomass (MSW and/or Sewage Sludge)\nas alternative fuels\nA potential reduction of CO2 emissions in the\ncement industry could be achieved by switching\nfrom traditional fossil fuel to a biomass fuel.\nSince most local cement factories are licensed\nto burn coal, petcoke, oil shale and alternative\nfuels such as waste tires and used oil, to replace\nthe expensive heavy fuel oil, they are equipped\nwith multi-purpose burners which reduce the\ninvestment costs for using biomass as alternative\nfuels. However, the required capital cost depends\non the needed storage, segregation, handling,\ngrinding and metering as well as environmental\npollution control measures. A value of 27.5 JOD/\ntonne of alternative fuel is used to estimate the\ninvestment cost based on the maximum estimated\ntonnes needed in 2046. So, the investment cost for\nthis option is estimated at 129,942,957 JD.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, studies\nof the maximum percentage of MSW and dried\nsewage sludge to be used, availability of stocks\nin the market, testing the emissions, conduct EIA\nstudy and getting the environmental clearance;\nit is expected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\n\n89\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nto be 25 years. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 814,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the Nitric Acid plant\nThis project involves the installation of a new N2O\nabatement technology that is not commonly used\nin nitric acid plants. The abatement technology is\na pelleted catalyst that will be installed inside the\nammonia burner just underneath the precious\nmetal gauzes. This technology is capable of\nreducing approximately 75% to 80% of the N2O\nformed at the precious metal gauzes inside\nthe ammonia burner to atmospheric N2 and O2\n(through communication with KEMAPCO).\nThe selected N2O abatement technology depends\non replacing some of the Al2O3 balls that support\nthe platinum-rhodium catalyst by a base metal\nsecondary catalyst, which is capable of reducing\nN2O by at least 75%.\nThis project will only be implemented for the sake\nof GHG emissions reduction; there are no other\ndirect benefits. Therefore, its implementation is\nstrongly dependent on the provision of economic\nincentives. The project is assumed to start in 2022\nand its lifetime is estimated to be the same as the\nlifetime of the KEMAPCO plant, which is estimated\nto be 25 years (till the year 2046). It is estimated\nthat implementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n1,659,000 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2046).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed IPPU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.11.\nTable 3.11: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nIPPU mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost\n(JD/tonne of\nCO2eq)\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw\nmaterials needed to produce clinker\n250\n-22.9\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II cement\n367\n-32.1\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nPozzolana\n238\n-32.0\nUse of biomass (MSW and/ or Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\n814\n-69.3\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia burner\nof the nitric acid plant\n1,659\n0.37\n3.3.5 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor AFOLU sector\nThe main mitigation options within AFOLU mainly\ninvolve one or more of three strategies:\n\nReduction/prevention of emissions to the\natmosphere by conserving existing carbon\npools in soils or vegetation that would\notherwise be lost, or by reducing emissions\nof CH4 and N2O,\n\nSequestration—enhancing the uptake of\ncarbon in terrestrial reservoirs, and thereby\nremoving CO2 from the atmosphere,\n\n90\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nReducing CO2 emissions by introducing\nchanges within demand-side options (e.g., by\nlifestyle changes, reducing losses and waste\nof food, changes in human diet, changes in\nwood consumption).\nGHG mitigation options in the AFOLU sector that\nwere considered in the FBUR report have been\nreviewed and updated. Relevant information is\npresented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table\nA.5. Table 3.12 is a summary of their status.\nTable 3.12: Status of the AFOLU mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in urban areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in northern area\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 1- Restoration of rangeland areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 2- New protected rangeland area as\nnatural reserve\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nPromoting for climate-smart agricultural practices in\nthe Jordan Valley\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for\nAFOLU are still valid. The projects will be modified\nand updated to be considered in this SBUR. These\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n\nIntroduce new trees plantation in Urban Areas\nLosses in urban trees are a continuous concern\neither due to snow storms, or from burning, and\ncutting due to land use change. No official numbers\nhave been published, but it was assumed that an\naverage loss of around 2,500 trees within Greater\nAmman Municipality area will be compensated\nfor, mostly by planting pine and coniferous trees.\nA medium growth coniferous tree, planted in an\nurban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years,\nsequesters 0.060-tonnes CO2 per planted tree. It\nis estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 1,502 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of\nthe project (2022 – 2042).\n\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in\nNorthern\nArea\nLosses in forest trees are a continuous concern,\neither due to snow storms, burning or illegal cutting.\nNo official numbers have been published regarding\nthe loss, but it was assumed that an average loss\nof around 30,000 trees within the Northern Area\nwill be compensated for, mostly by planting pine\nand coniferous trees. A medium growth coniferous\ntree, planted in an urban setting and allowed to\ngrow for 10 years, sequesters 0.060-tonne CO2 per\nplanted tree. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 11,923 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2042).\n\nRangeland restoration and increase in forage\nproduction Projects\nThe projects suggest that the Ministry of Agriculture\nestablish a public corporation responsible for\nforage production and sales to livestock owners.\nThe corporation will be responsible for buying the\nplants and for hiring labor for cultivation.\nTwo areas for production will be considered:\n Rangelands Project 1: Restoration of\nRangeland Areas and Rangelands\n\n50,000 dunums in the Badia (Al Jafr and\nAl Husseinieh) sub-districts within the\nMa’an Governorate. It is assumed that the\nproductivity of these area will be 50 kg/\ndunum of dry matter (in areas with 100200 mm rainfall). Suggested plant types are\nperennial fodder shrubs. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n888,140 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2036).\n\n91\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nProject 2: New Protected Rangeland Area\n as Natural Reserve combined\n100,000 dunums in the wide desert valleys of\nsouth Badia. The average annual dry matter\nproduction is 4 kg/dunum in normal years\nand with good restoration practices, the\nproductivity can be increased to 15 kg/dunum.\nThe project will harness direct benefits for\nprotection of floral biodiversity through\ncontrolling the grazing of the indigenous\nAtriplex halimus shrubs. Much of this area is\ncovered with chert and an underlying thin\nlayer of fine textured soil. Artemisia herba-\nalba, Retama raetam, Achillea fragrantissima,\nAtriplex halimus and Poa bulbosa are common\nin the wadi beds. Despite its deterioration this\nregion is known to be the main grazing land\nin Jordan.\nIt is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 1,776,280 tonnes CO2\nover the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2036).\nThe projects will achieve reductions through CO2\nemissions offset from natural soil carbon release\ncaused by rangeland deterioration. The project will\nharness direct benefit for soil resources through\nrain harvest techniques as well as soil erosion\ncontrol techniques (erosion is caused by flow from\nflash floods). It is assumed to have an average of 35\naverage sized shrub/dunum and the sequestration\nrate is 5.57 tonnes SOC/ha/year and a lifetime of\n15 years will be assumed for calculation purposes.\n\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices\nin the Jordan Valley\nClimate smart agriculture is not a new agricultural\nsystem, nor is it a set of practices. It is a new approach,\na way to guide the needed changes of agricultural\nsystems, given the necessity to jointly address food\nsecurity and climate change. It contributes to the\nachievement of sustainable development goals\nand integrates the three dimensions of sustainable\ndevelopment (economic, social and environmental)\nby jointly addressing food security and climate\nchallenges. It is composed of three main pillars:\nSustainably increasing agricultural productivity\nand incomes; adapting and building resilience\nto climate change; reducing and/or removing\ngreenhouse gases emissions, where possible.\nSustainable crop production, controlled grazing\nand maintained forest systems can sequester\nsubstantial and variable amounts of carbon from\nthe atmosphere and store it in soils and vegetation.\nCarbon sequestration will not only stabilize climate\nbut will also increase the overall resilience of the\nagro-ecosystems. Widespread adoption of climate-\nsmart practices has the potential to make major\ncontributions to the achievement of national food\nsecurity and development goals. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will result in\na discounted emission reduction of 13,057 tonnes\nCO2 over the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2026).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nproposed AFOLU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.13.\n\n92\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.13: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nAFOLU mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost\n(JD/tonne of\nCO2eq)\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Urban Areas\n0.15\n40\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Northern Area\n11.92\n14.5\nRangeland 1- Restoration of rangeland areas\n1,776.28 \n18\nRangeland 2- New protected rangeland area as\nnatural reserve\n888.14\n10\nPromoting for Climate-smart agricultural practices in\nthe Jordan Valley\n13.06\n-1333\n3.3.6 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures for the waste sector\nGHG mitigation options in the waste sector that were considered in the FBUR report have been reviewed\nand assessed.

A\nconsiderable amount of biogas could only\nbe generated from Al-Dulail landfill while\nAl-Karak, Al-Salt and Madaba domestic solid\nwaste landfill sites were considered not valid\ndue to low production of gas in those sites.\n\nThe proposed project aims at collecting the\ngenerated biogas, treating it for impurities,\ngenerating electricity using biogas generator\nand connecting the generated electricity to\nthe national electricity grid. The suggested\nproject will contribute to reducing the\namount of fuel used for electricity generation.\nThe starting year for implementing this\nproject is 2022 and construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year,\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nproject will be in 2023. The lifetime of the\nproject is 25 years ( 2022 – 2047).\n\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge\ngenerated from the domestic wastewater\ntreatment plants. The project was considered\nto be valid for Wadi Arab, Baqa’a, and\nMadaba domestic wastewater treatment\nplants and thus emission reductions were\nrecalculated while it was considered invalid\nfor Ramtha and Salt due to decreased inflow\nof wastewater to these treatment plants.\n\nThe proposed projects aim at generating\nbiogas from the sludge and connecting\nthe generated electricity to the national\nelectricity\ngrid.\nThese\nprojects\nwill\ncontribute to reducing the amount of fuel\nused for electricity generation, taking into\nconsideration that a considerable amount\nof sludge produced from the wastewater\ntreatment plants without any utilization.\nIn the three projects of Wadi Arab, Baqa’a,\nand Madaba the construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nprojects will be the next year. The starting\nyear for implementing the proposed projects\nin Madaba and Wadi Al Arab is 2021 for a\nlifetime of 25 years (2021 to 2046) while the\nproject in Baqa’a will be implemented in 2025\nfor a lifetime of 25 years (2025 to 2049).\nThe following assumptions were used during the\nupdate of waste projects:\n\nTotal amount of organic material generated\nis assumed to increase annually by 2.2%,\n\nDensity of methane is 0.717 kg/m3,\n\nThe captured methane from all landfills\nis calculated according to the PRIF study\n(Environment and use of methane from\nmunicipal waste in Amman, 1993), where\nthe average value is used,\n\nElectricity grid emission factor is considered\nto be 0.4585 kgCO2/KWh,\n\nThe calculation of generated electricity in MW\nis based on 8,000 working hours per year,\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nsludge produced at wastewater treatment\nplants is assumed to be sold at a fixed price of\n0.094 JD/kWh (each kW produced is assumed\nto replace 1kw sold from the electricity grid),\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nbiogas produced from landfills is assumed\nto be sold at a fixed price of 0.06 JD/kWh,\n\nThe cost of a 1 MW biogas electricity\ngeneration landfill system (generator, wells,\npiping, etc.) is 1.5 million JD, according to\nthe International Renewable Energy Agency\n(IRENA),\n\nThe cost of 1 MW biogas electricity generation\nfrom biogas system (digester, WWTP\ngenerator, piping, etc.) is 4 million JD (Jordan\nbiogas project),\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of\nmaintenance, operation, overheads and\nsupervision costs (3% of capital cost) in\nwastewater\ntreatment\nplant\nsystems,\n\n94\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of maintenance,\noperation, overheads, and supervision costs\nin biogas projects in landfills (5% of capital\ninvestment, according to IRENA).\nAll mitigation options under the waste sector were\nconsidered as energy measures because the biogas\nwill be used for electric power generation. The cost\nand the CO2 emission reductions are analyzed for\nthe 5 proposed projects. A summary of the results\nis shown in the following table 3.15.\nTable 3.15: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nwaste mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost (JD/\ntonne of CO2eq)\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil\ndomestic solid waste landfill\n1,003.66\n- 0.50\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Wadi Arab domestic wastewater treatment\nplant\n280.30\n- 4.00\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Baqa’a tertiary domestic wastewater\ntreatment plant\n188.03\n4.48\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Maddaba domestic wastewater treatment\nplant\n188.23\n4.54\n3.3.7 Main results of updating the FBUR mitigation measures\n3.3.7.1 GHG emissions reduction of the updated measures\nTwenty three GHG mitigation projects out of the 39 projects that were proposed previously in the FBUR\nare still valid. The yearly GHG emission reductions were recalculated for each mitigation measure over\nits lifetime. Table 3.16, shows the total GHG emission reductions of the 23 measures for selected years.\nTable 3.16: GHG total emissions reductions (Gg of CO2eq) from the updated measures for selected years\nYear\nTotal GHG Emissions Reductions of the 23 updated measures\n(Gg of CO2eq)\n2025\n1,511.45\n2030\n2,487.75\n2035\n2,591.57\n2040\n2,400.42\n2045\n3,228.82\n2050\n1,220.47\n\n95\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.7.2 GHG abatement cost analysis for the\nupdated projects\nGHG abatement cost was recalculated for the 23\nprojects in addition to the yearly and reduced\nemission reductions. These projects belong to\nseveral sectors and subsectors including primary\nenergy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste,\nand agriculture.\nIt is concluded from the abatement cost analysis\nfor the updated FBUR valid projects that the most\nfeasible options are the energy mitigation projects.\nThe findings indicated that in particular the energy\nefficiency should receive the most attention. Table\n3.17 shows the abatement marginal cost for all\nmitigation measures ranked from the highest\nto the lowest and figure 3.1 shows the updated\nmitigation projects grouped by sector.\nFigure 3.1 Abatement marginal cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for all updated mitigation measures grouped by sector\n Legend: AGRI- AFOLU projects, waste- waste projects, IPPU- Industrial Processes projects, RE- Renewable Energy Projects,\nEE- Energy Efficiency Projects and PE-Primary Energy Projects)\n\n96\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.17: All updated mitigation projects ranked from the highest GHG reduction cost (JD/tonne CO2eq) to\nthe lowest cost\nProject Name\nEmissions\nReduction Unit\nCost (JD/tonne\nof CO2eq)\n1\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 1)\n118.68\n2\nForestry- Introduction of new plantations in Urban Areas\n40.00\n3\nRangeland 1- Restoration of Rangeland Areas\n18.00\n4\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Northern Area\n14.50\n5\nRangeland 2- New Protected Rangeland Area as Natural Reserve\n10.00\n6\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Madaba\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.54\n7\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Baqa’a tertiary\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.48\n8\nCatalytic Reduction of N2O inside the Ammonia Burner of the Nitric Acid\nPlant\n0.37\n9\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil domestic solid waste\nlandfill\n-0.50\n10\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Wadi Arab\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n-4.00\n11\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 2)\n-7.18\n12\nNatural gas distribution network in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\n-13.78\n13\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw materials needed to\nproduce clinker\n-22.90\n14\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45% of Pozzolana\n-32.00\n15\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\n-32.10\n16\nUse of biomass (domestic solid waste or/and sewage sludge) as\nalternative fuels in cement plants\n-69.30\n17\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water tanks in food\nindustry\n-108.04\n18\nLoss reduction in transmission and distribution\n-108.52\n19\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional burners in steel\nindustry\n-110.03\n20\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 houses\n-183.64\n21\nSolar water heaters 3- 30,000 houses\n-189.95\n22\nInsulating pipes, fittings and tanks in food industries\n-215.16\n23\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices in the Jordan valley\n-1333.00\n\n97\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nReferences\n\nAshley Murray and Lynn Price, 2008.

Some of these elements are implemented at\nthe international level and others at the national\nlevel.\nAt the international level, the MRV framework for\ndeveloping countries includes:\n\nGuidance on reporting through National\nCommunications (NCs) and Biennial Update\nReports (BURs),\n\nGuidance on setting up domestic MRV\nframeworks,\n\nA process for consideration of information\nsubmitted by developing countries in their\nBURs through an International Consultant\nand Analysis (ICA),\n\nInternational guidance on MRV for those\ndeveloping\ncountries\nthat\nvoluntarily\nimplement reforestation and avoided\ndeforestation activities and wish to take the\nopportunity of a results-based payment.\nAt the national level, Parties to the UNFCCC\nare expected to implement these international\nguidance and to prepare and report information\nevery two years through their NCs and BURs.\nThe list of information elements to be reported\nincludes annual GHG emissions inventories,\nmitigation actions and their estimated effects, as\nwell as technical and financial support needed and\nreceived. Jordan was among the first developing\ncountries to submit its first NC under the UNFCCC\nin 1997.\nMRV is central to effectively implement the NDCs,\nwhich describes countries mitigation goals and\npolicies submitted under the Paris Agreement.\nMeasurement is needed to identify emissions\ntrends, determine where to focus Green House\nGas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts, track\nmitigation-related support, assess whether\nmitigation actions planned under the NDCs\nare effective, evaluate the impact of support\nreceived, and monitor progress achieved in\nreducing emissions. Reporting and verification\nare important for ensuring transparency, good\ngovernance, accountability, and credibility of\nresults, and for building confidence that resources\nare being utilized effectively.\nAt COP 13, through the Bali Action Plan, Parties\nagreed on the principle of applying MRV for\ndeveloping country Parties, which laid the\nfoundation for the subsequent elaboration of\nthe existing comprehensive MRV framework for\ndeveloping country Parties. MRV occurs at the\ninternational level, but can also be voluntary at\nthe national level.\n4.2 Jordan’s multi-tiered MRV system\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its Market Readiness Proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\n(PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined a plan for\nimplementing the market readiness components\nthat will be necessary to support the development\nof appropriate market based instruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n\nA national MRV system and registry for\nclimate\nmitigation\nmeasures,\n\nDesigning a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n\nExploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\n\n101\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith developing a multi-tiered integrated MRV\nsystem. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE); adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors and will serve in tracking progress\ntowards Nationally Determined Contribution\n(NDC) commitments.\nThe main functions of the system are shown in\nthe figure below (adopted from PMR initiative\nbrochure, 2018), and they are described briefly\nin the subsequent sections.\nFigure 4.1: The main functions of the MRV system (adopted from PMR initiative Brochure, 2018).\nData Extracting, Transforming & Loading:\nthe system acts as database for GHG emissions\nat project, ministry, sectoral and national levels,\nwith main functions of; metadata1 viewing and\nediting, reference2 data monitoring, emissions\ndata monitoring and uploading data in a standard\nformat or automatically importing data.\nData Processing: the system provides a database\nof validated emissions and reduction, with main\nfunctions of pre-determined calculations of data\ncompared to previous years and calculation of\nGHGs and emission reduction based on proxy\ndata3 and modelled scenarios.\n2. Data used to classify or categorize other data\n3. Data that measures the cause and effect relationship between two\n variables indirectly.\nData Review and Verification: the system provides\napproved GHG emissions database:\n\nValidated GHG emissions and emission\nreductions data based on reviews and\nverification (by third party, if applicable),\n\nStatus of emissions and GHG emission\nreductions and browse/change data values.\nData Reporting: the system provides a database\nfor final GHG emissions.\nData are reported and shared in a standard format\navailable in graphics and tables.\n1. A set of data that describes and gives information about other data.\n\n102\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nThe following figures (Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3)\nillustrates the designed MRV system.

Also,\nnon-Annex I parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity-building and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility,\nParties included in Annex II to the Convention\nand other developed country Parties, the Green\nClimate Fund and multilateral institutions for\nactivities relating to climate change, including for\nthe preparation of the current biennial update\nreport.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nAccordingly, this chapter aims at providing a\nbrief description of the constraints and gaps\nidentified in previous national climate change\ncommunications and the First Biennial Update\nReport (FBUR). It will also identify newly arising\nconstraints and gaps, and needed actions and\nresources required to overcome them.\n5.2 Institutional Constraints and Gaps and\nPolicy Mainstreaming\n5.2.1 Current institutional arrangements\nClimate change (CC) Directorate, Environment Law\nNo. 6/2017 and CC bylaw No.79/2019.\nThe Directorate of Climate Change was established\nat the MoEnv in 2014 to act as the institutional hub\nfor coordinating and developing all climate change\nactivities in Jordan in relation to the UNFCCC and\nthe global climate change governance system and\ninitiatives.\nJordan has issued in May 2017 a new Environmental\nProtection Law (No.6/2017) that mandates the\nMoEnv to “coordinate national efforts to project\nClimate Change impacts, identify the sectors\naffected, and limit and mitigate greenhouse gas\nemissions by means such as funding, technology\ntransfer and reallocation of available funding and\nits distribution to Climate Change activities”.\nAnother significant milestone, is the issuance of\nthe Climate Change Bylaw No. 79 in 2019 which\nwas adopted pursuant to article no. 30(a) of the\nEnvironmental Protection Law No. 6/2017. The\nBylaw came as a response to the need to define\na framework that establishes a clear institutional\nsetting to address climate change challenges\nand ensure full engagement of all partners and\nstakeholders including both the technical experts\nand the decision makers.\nUnder the provisions of this bylaw, a National\nClimate Change Committee (NCCC) has been\nformed. This Committee is chaired by the Minister\nof Environment and consists of the secretary\ngenerals and high level members from the related\ninstitutions.\nThe bylaw identified the responsibility of the\nMoEnv as UNFCCC focal point to:\na. Seek approval from the NCCC on proposed\npolicies and strategies to adapt to the\nnegative impacts of climate change, and\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to be\nsubmitted to the Cabinet for adoption and\ninclusion in sectoral policies and strategies,\nb.\nPrepare nationally determined contributions,\nnational communication reports, biennial\nupdate reports, national adaptation plans\nand other climate change relevant documents\nand update them according to international\nconventions and obligations,\nc. Represent the Kingdom in international\nclimate change commissions and conferences,\nd.\nCreate and manage a national inventory\ndatabase to document emissions data,\nmitigation and adaptation measures and\nclimate finance data,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n107\ne. Authorize accredited entities to verify the\nresults of national inventory reports according\nto a criteria that will be set for this purpose,\nf. Provide technical support to scientific research\ncentres through opening up channels of\ncommunication with equivalent international\nclimate research centres,\ng.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders to\ndevelop a national climate finance plan, that\nidentifies projects, programmes and plans of\npriority,\nh.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders with\nregard to climate change market mechanisms.\nIn addition to the NCCC, technical teams are\nnominated according to specific needs; consisting\nof experts and specialists from governmental\norganizations, scientific research institutions, civil\nsociety organizations, and other related entities\nidentified in the bylaw.\nAlso, the bylaw set a group of entities mandated to\nsupport the MoEnv with providing data, available\nat their entities, needed for GHG inventory\nestimation, NDCs and financial support tracking.\nEstablishment of Green Economy Unit\nA Green Economy Unit was established at the\nMoEnv in 2014, with the purpose of coordinating\nthe national efforts regarding developing and\nupdating the green economy national strategies\nand legislation in accordance with the sectoral\nneeds. This unit works hand in hand with the\nClimate Change Directorate (CCD) to support\nenvironmental and climate action in Jordan, while\nalso achieving sustainable economic green growth\nobjectives.\nIn 2017 and with the support of Global Green\nGrowth Institute (GGGI) and UNEP, a National\nGreen Growth strategy, was published, it has\nidentified green growth as a top national priority.\nThen, recently in 2020, the Green Growth National\nAction Plans for (2021-2025) was launched for\nsix main sectors (energy, waste, water, transport,\nagriculture and tourism).\nNDC Partnership\nIn March 2017, Jordan through the MoEnv joined\nthe NDC Partnership as a member country, Jordan\nbecame a part of the global coalition of 130\ncountries and institutions working together to\nmobilize support and achieve ambitious climate\ngoals. As a global coalition emerging from the\nParis Agreement, the NDC Partnership works with\nJordan to shift the NDC’s focus from commitment\nto implementation, supporting fast-tracked,\nenhanced NDC implementation. By facilitating and\ncoordinating the delivery of technical and financial\nsupport and knowledge services, the Partnership\naims to bridge Jordan’s NDC implementation\nneeds with Partnership resources.\nTo accelerate the implementation of its NDC, the\nGovernment of Jordan (GoJ) unveiled its NDC\nAction Plan in April 2019. Jordan’s NDC Action\nPlan is a detailed statement of measures aligned\nwith the mitigation and adaptation objectives\nstated in its NDC. It offers a concrete roadmap\nfor transitioning to a low-emissions and climate\nresilient economy by increasing the share of\nrenewables in the energy mix and scaling up\nenergy efficiency measures; adapting to the\nimpacts of climate change in water, agricultural\nand health sectors; and strengthening the\nresilience of vulnerable groups and ecosystems.\nThe measures listed in the Action Plan are at\ndifferent stages of development and require\ndifferent types of support, including technical\nsupport for feasibility studies, developing\nfinancing strategies, monitoring and evaluation\nservices, and financial support for implementation\nof the investment ready measures.\nMainstreaming climate change at the national\nlevel\nOn the national level many institutions made\nconsiderable progress in including climate\nchange in their entities mandates. Many\nnational institutions established climate change\ndirectorates or units to follow up with Ministry of\nEnvironment, such as the ministries of Agriculture,\nWater and Irrigation, Transport, The National\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n108\nAgriculture Research Centre, and The Royal\nJordanian Geographic Centre.\nAlso, recently the Ministry of Environment\nsigned an agreement with King Abdullah II\nCentre for Excellence to update the Environment\nSustainability Award for industries to enhance their\ncommitments towards environment protection\nincluding the reduction of GHGs.\nThe private sector is engaging as well, with a\nunit for energy and environmental sustainability\nestablished in Jordan Chamber of Industry,\nthrough which they work with the industries\nand the government to encourage low emission\ntechnologies.\nOne of the most recent strategies that was recently\nlaunched, is the National Energy Strategy 2020\n– 2030. This strategy aims to reduce the CO2\nemissions by 10% by 2030. Also the Agriculture\nDevelopment National Strategy 2020-2025\nfocused on adaptation and the impacts of climate\nchange on biodiversity and land degradation.\nAt the city level, Greater Amman Municipality in\ncooperation with Ministry of Environment and\nWorld Bank launched in 2018 “Amman Climate\nPlan - A Vision for 2050 Amman”. This inaugural\nplan sets an interim target of a 40% reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This plan sets\nout a shared vision for collaboration among the\ngovernment, private sector, development partners\nand residents of Amman. This plan is a living,\nevolving document that the city will continue to\nbuild on until reaching a carbon-neutral city in\n2050.\n5.2.2 Identified gaps and constraints and\nrecommendations to address them\nThe CCD at Ministry of Environment, as UNFCCC\nfocal point, plays a pivotal role in climate change\nactivities at the national level. However, the\ndirectorate needs strengthening in term of human\nresources and sustainability. It is recommended\nto increase the number of the staff and enhance\ntheir capacity to be able to carry out their huge\nresponsibilities in the long term.\nAlthough the climate change bylaw was issued\nin 2019, it is not fully functioning yet. Up to date,\nthe number of meetings, between the NCCC and\nthe technical teams is not sufficient and no major\ndecisions have been taken on the ground. Also,\nthere are entities identified in Annex (3) of the\nbylaw who are responsible for providing needed\ndata for the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory\nestimation, however, only a slight improvement\nwas detected in providing and facilitating\ncollection of data and still more collaboration is\nneeded.\nThe following are some recommendations to\nenact and activate the bylaw, its committee and\ntechnical groups:\n\nIt is recommended that MoEnv as chair of\nthe NCCC highlights continually the role of\ndifferent ministries and institutions in the\narea of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n\nSeek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to the climate change bylaw, in\nareas relevant to their roles,\n\nIt is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at\nleast 3 years) to be able to strengthen their\nwork and it’s highly recommended to prepare\ntheir successors in advance,\n\nCCDs at different ministries and institutions\nare important vehicles to mainstream climate\nchange into the strategies and policies of\ntheir respective institutions. As such, it is\nrecommend that the MoEnv coordinates\ncontinuously with these departments and\nsupports them in identifying their capacity\nbuilding needs.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n109\n5.3 Technical and Capacity Building Needs\n5.3.1 Identified gaps and capacity building needs\nthrough the Technical Analysis- ICA process\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the\nUNFCCC was prepared and submitted in late 2017.\nAfter its submission, a Team of Technical Experts\n(TTE) were formed by the UNFCCC secretariat to\nperform review. These experts were trained to\nconduct reviews as part of the ICA according to\nDecision 2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s first BUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify capacity-building needs\nof developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NCs:\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series;\nb.\nDevelop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources;\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis;\nd.\nDevelop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and Emission\nFactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis;\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct\nongoing surveys to provide accurate data\nand to integrate climate change questions\nin existing energy surveys that mainly focus\non energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng.\nEnhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh.\nEnhance technical capacity to report\non mitigation actions that are already\nimplemented or ongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress\nand the underlying steps envisaged for the\nplanned mitigation actions and when they\nwill be implemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\n5.3.2 Reported capacity-building needs in Jordan’s\nFBUR\nThe following capacity-building needs were\nreported in the FBUR (most of them are still valid)\ncovering the following areas:\nGHG inventory preparation, including:\n\nThere is a need to build capacity in the use\nof the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Software.\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 did not provide emission estimates for\nindirect GHGs such as CO, NOx, NMVOC, and\nother gases not controlled by the Montreal\nProtocol, such as SOx because the 2006 IPCC\nSoftware does not support the estimation of\nthose gases,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n110\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 have been estimated using the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines, which have structural and\nmethodological differences with the Revised\n1996 IPCC Guidelines used in estimating GHG\nemissions inventories for earlier NCs, which\nmade it difficult to provide a consistent time\nseries,\n\nIn preparing all GHG inventories so far, default\nemission factors were used since there are\nno available studies to develop national\nemission factors. The use of national emission\nfactors is highly vital, particularly for key\ncategories within the inventory.\n GHG mitigation measures, including:\n\nStakeholders had limited expertise and\nknowledge\ncapacity\nfor\nconducting\nmitigation analysis for the transportation,\nIPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors,\n\nThe complex nature of mitigation actions\nand initiatives that are being developed\nand implemented within the UNFCCC had\nbeen a challenge. The various potentials and\nfeatures of Clean Development Mechanism\n(CDM), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs), Low Emission Development\n(LED), Intended Nationally Determined\nContributions (INDCs), and other mitigation\ntools make it difficult for a holistic planning\nperspective in climate change mitigation,\n\nData quality, completeness, and accuracy\nare of a primary concern when it comes to\nestablishing the baseline and mitigation\nanalysis. Data are not up to date, nor are\nthey readily available in one place.\n5.3.3 Capacity building needs and\nrecommendations to fulfill commitments under\nthe Paris Agreement (PA)\nThe Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency\nFramework (ETF) places new and more strict\nrequirements on developing countries. To\nimplement these new requirements capacitybuilding support is vital. Article 11 of the PA\nemphasizes the importance of building the\ncapacity of developing country Parties. The\nobjective is to allow them to take effective\nclimate change actions, particularly via the\nimplementation of adaptation and mitigation\nactions, so as to facilitate “technology development,\ndissemination and deployment, access to climate\nfinance, relevant aspects of education, training and\npublic awareness and the transparent, timely and\naccurate communication of information”.\nAlso, capacity building is essential to drive climate\ntransparency. The 2015 PA outlines an “Enhanced\nTransparency Framework” including greater\nrequirements for developing countries. Some\ndeveloping countries have struggled to fulfill preParis Agreement transparency requirements and\nwill need capacity-building support to implement\nthe PA’s more stringent requirements (WRI\nWorking paper, 2019).\nThe new requirements for the PA’s enhanced\ntransparency framework have shown that\nthese requirements represent greater efforts\nto communicate on climate change action and\nsupport. Countries agreed on the guidelines\nfor the enhanced transparency framework in\nDecember 2018. However, new efforts to build\ncapacity for the transparency framework need not\n“start from scratch” but should build on and learn\nfrom the history of transparency and capacity\nbuilding under the UNFCCC.\nThe processes under the PA, including the\ntechnical expert review and the facilitative,\nmultilateral consideration of progress under\nArticle 13, the global stock take under Article 14,\nand the mechanism to facilitate implementation\nand promote compliance under Article 15 are\nexcellent capacity-building instruments since\nthey help countries improve their transparencyrelated governance systems and improve data\nand information needs for reporting. Building or\ndeveloping capacity is a process that takes time\nand requires Jordan to “learn by doing”, and by\nleveraging national experiences, lessons learned,\nand emerging tools or approaches developed over\nthe past 20 years.\nCapacity for transparency can be strengthened\nthrough enhanced governance and institutional\nstructures and supported by the right participatory\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n111\napproach. Jordan must organize institutional and\ngovernance structures able to collect, report, and\nuse data for decision-making. Governments’ ability\nto engage effectively with key stakeholders is\ncritical to obtaining data of quality and in turn\nproviding the right signals and guidance to\nconvince stakeholders to support government’s\nefforts.\nLasting systems and knowledge are critical to\nbuilding capacity. More effort is required to\nbuild the critical knowledge within key national\ninstitutions, by looking at the educational\nchannels and exploring further pedagogical\napproaches, including twinning programs, to\nproduce active national and regional peer and\nprofessional communities. National capacitybuilding centres—national universities and\ntraining centres—need to play a central role\nin the building of more durable processes for\ncollecting and managing better data, while\ncreating sustainable skills and jobs.\nJordan has already started the capacity building\nprocess by taking part in the BUR ICA (as\nmentioned\npreviously).\nAs for the implementation of Article 6 (A6) under\nthe PA, Jordan has recently started the work of\npreparing a roadmap to promote and facilitate\nJordan’s engagement in A6. A working committee\nhas been formed, aiming at raising awareness and\nbuilding the capacity of the national stakeholders.\nArticle 6 has three operative paragraphs, two\nof which relate to carbon markets: (1) Article\n6.2 provides an accounting framework for\ninternational cooperation, such as linking the\nemissions-trading schemes of two or more\ncountries. It also allows for the international\ntransfer of carbon credits between countries, (2)\nArticle 6.4 establishes a central UN mechanism to\ntrade credits from emissions reductions generated\nthrough specific projects, (3) Article 6.8 establishes\na work program for non-market approaches, such\nas applying taxes to discourage emissions.\nWhile A6 established these concepts in broad\nstrokes and countries achieved some progress\non defining the rules over the years, their final\nshape remains yet to be agreed.\n5.4 Technology Needs Assessment and\nTechnology\nTransfer\nThe Ministry of Environment, with Global\nEnvironment\nFacility\n(GEF)-UNDP\nsupport,\nhas previously published a Technology Needs\nAssessment (TNA) and technology transfer report\nfor 2004-2005. More recently, the Ministry has\ncompleted a climate change technology needs\nassessment for Jordan for the period 2015-2017,\nwhere three reports have been published by\nthis project. The first report is for the selection\nof priority mitigation and adaptation sectors\nfor TNA activities in Jordan. The second report\npresented a list of the main barriers and an\nenabling framework, while the third report,\nwhich was published in August 2017, offered a\ntechnology action plan for two priority mitigation\nsectors (energy and transport) and two priority\nadaptation sectors (water and agriculture).\nThe following TNA analysis is extracted from the\nthree published reports.\nThe top three mitigation technologies for the\nenergy sector were:\n(1) Solar thermal,\n(2) PV for electrification, and\n(3) PV for water pumping.\nThe three top-ranked priority mitigation\ntechnologies for the transportation sector were:\n(1) Bus Rapid Transit,\n(2) Improving pedestrian infrastructure, and\n(3) Ticketing systems to improve the quality and\nthe attractiveness of public transport services.\nThe final results for the water sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Roof-top rainwater harvesting,\n(2) Augmenting and expansion of Water Users\nAssociation (WUAs), and\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n112\n(3) Desalination and brackish water treatment\nand re-use.\nThe results for the agricultural sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Water saving technologies, such as drip or\nsubsurface irrigation,\n(2) Farm-level water harvesting, and\n(3) Plant varieties resistant to climate change.\nAlso recently, in April 2020, the Green Growth\nAction Plan (GGAP) was published by MoEnv,\nidentifying clearly the relation between the green\ngrowth and the climate change. The GGAP focused\non many interventions related to technology and\nknowledge transfer in the six sectors; the below\nare selected technologies that were identified:\nEnergy\n\nImprove energy demand management\nthrough development of a smart electricity\ngrid,\n\nImplement electric vehicle charging stations\nand services provision in Greater Amman\nMunicipality through a public-private\npartnership,\n\nDevelop and implement a national energy\nstorage action plan and investment pipeline,\n\nIncrease public investment in energy sector\nresearch and development,\n\nImprove the enabling environment and\ncapacity development support for the\ngrowth of the Energy Services Companies\n(ESCOs) market.\nTransport\n\nSupport the deployment of Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS) to allow a modal\nand fair integration of the public and private\ntransport systems in the city of Amman,\n\nEstablish a national centre of excellence and\ncapacity building program for sustainable\ntransport,\n\nDevelop a national electric mobility strategy\nand action plan,\n\nDesign and implement a public transport\nelectric mobility pilot and capacity building\nprogram in Amman.\nWaste\n\nEstablish a national centre for excellence on\nwaste management and circular economy\nto promote innovation, training, R&D,\ninvestment, and policy work,\n\nConduct market assessment and feasibility\nstudy to identify potential projects and\nprograms to divert organic waste from\nmunicipal solid waste streams.\nWater\n\nTechnical Assistance to support water\nefficiency in businesses, industries, and\ncommercial activities (Based on SwitchMed1\nExperience),\n\nExpand the Samra Wastewater Treatment\nPlant (Phase III),\n\nUndertake Desalination of Seawater at the\nGulf of Aqaba through Renewable Energy\nSources.\nAgriculture\n\nMap and optimize research to impact\npathways to improve relevance of innovation\nefforts in the agriculture sector,\n\nDevelop a flexible crop planning and variety\nselection methodology and decisionmaking process based on crop-per-drop\nand economic competitiveness,\n\nDesign and implement program to support\ndemonstration resource efficiency projects\nin the olive cultivation and oil production\nsector,\n\nDevelop and implement pipeline of projects\n(all sizes) and policy recommendations to\nincrease use of aquaponics and hydroponics\nin urban and rural areas,\n\nUpgrade packaging, scaling, storage and\ncooling of fruits and vegetables managed\nby the private sector,\n\nPromote the development of organic\nagriculture through knowledge exchange\nand market development.\n1. EU initiative aiming at enabling the switch to resourceefficient and circular economies in the Southern Mediterranean\nregion\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n113\nTourism\n\nDevelop a roadmap for increasing resource\nefficiency in the tourism sector,\n\nEstablish a tourism sector centre of\nexcellence to promote innovation and market\ndevelopment.\n5.5 Financial Resources Needs\nAccording to NDCs, the Government of Jordan\nhas proposed sectoral mitigation policies and\nprograms to achieve a 14% reduction in GHG\nemissions by 2030 compared to the baseline\nscenario. The 14% reduction of GHG emissions\nis divided into two parts. The first part seeks\nto achieve a 1.5% reduction in GHG emissions\nthrough unilateral actions, while the remaining\n12.5% reduction is contingent and conditional\non receiving international financial support. In\nits NDCs, Jordan put the estimate of reducing\nGHG emissions by 14% at USD 5.7 billion. To\nfinance mitigation measures in the energy sector,\nJordan will require USD 5,158 million to meet its\nconditional mitigation targets.\nWhile a significant proportion of this is likely to\ncome from international sources of finance, one\nof the key sectoral actions for the energy sector\nis attracting private sector finance and reducing\nadministrative obstacles in order to enable JREEEF\nto support investments at early stages.\nIn Jordan, the role of the private sector is crucial\nand essential in achieving our NDC, the very\nhigh ratio of (Debt: GDP) makes it difficult for\nthe Government to obtain loans. Therefore, the\ngovernment is considering the role that the\nmobilization of private investment can play a role\nin implementing and achieving our NDC.\nThe key challenges in financing climate change\nprojects are summarized as follows:\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and its\nnegative effects on health, the economy\nand society, it is expected that financial\nsupport from donors will be directed to the\nhealth sector to mitigate the effects of this\npandemic, and this may negatively affect\nthe availability of the required support from\ninternational bodies or public budgets at\nthe national level to implement projects\nto protect the environment in general and\nclimate change projects in particular,\n\nLack of Climate Finance Framework (policy\nor strategy),\n\nBanks in Jordan, in general, are interested in\nproviding finance to RE and EE projects. Banks\nprefer financing RE projects, particularly\nthose which are of a larger size and linked\nto their existing client base. EE and smaller\nsized projects are less preferred,\n\nTo minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n\nThere is a lack of appropriate financial\nproducts,\n\nProject developers lack technical capacity.\nThe work of public financing institutions, such\nas JREEEF and Jordan Environment Fund (JEF),\nalthough small scale, could play a crucial role in\npromoting early stage investments, particularly\nfor public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, and\nfor Projects with co-financing. For JEF to fund\nmitigation activities will require a widening of\nits current role to include a specific focus on\nmitigation activity, and the development of\nproject selection criteria including an assessment\nof projects’ impact on GHG emissions. In addition,\nJEF currently lacks adequate human, technical, and\nfinancial capability to perform its current role, it\nneeds strengthening at various levels to have an\nexpanded role.\nJREEEF now is active and has full and adequate\ninstitutional, technical, and financial capacity to\nmanage the fund, supported by a management\ncommittee, supportive legislation (JREEEF By-\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n114\nLaw), a transparent and effective governance\nstructure, a strategic business plan, and financial\nsupport windows.\nThe majority of financial resources pumped into\nenvironmental sectors in Jordan come from donor\ncountries through bilateral agreements that focus\non fiscal and developmental challenges in the\ncountry. Framework agreements and strategies\nwith major donors like UNDP, United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID),\nUNEP, EU, GIZ, UNIDO, and other agencies have\nbeen developed and they address a variety of\nsustainable development objectives. The donor\ncommunity is supportive of a public registry of\nprojects which would allow transparency and\ncoordination of ongoing activities, as well as the\nassessment of their cost effectiveness. In addition,\nthese donors are particularly supportive of\ndeveloping strong GHG MRV frameworks, believed\nto be key to demonstrating the effectiveness of\nclimate financing (details about the current MRV\ncan be found in section 4). Financial institutions\nand banks are interested in entering this new\nsector. Several green loans and programs are\nbeing established and green suppliers and\nmanufacturers are growing in number. However,\nthe market lacks proactive marketing and public\noutreach.\nPreviously an amount of 112 million JD were\nmade available for RE and EE financing in Jordan;\n76 million JD of the total were made available\nthrough the four commercial banks using the\nCentral Bank of Jordan’s window for RE and EE,\nand 36 million JD was made available through\nthe Agence Français de Development (AFD)\nfacility. This experience was not successful, key\nchallenges in disbursing these funds included\nthe lack of credible market references and short\ncredit history. Another challenge for banks was\nthe lack of sufficient knowledge to verify project\nassumptions, technologies, or risks. They need\naccess to an independent, credible reference\nbody for the accreditation of RE and EE projects.\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps and\nneeds:\n\nExpansion of the framework for the MRV\nsystem for Received Support that addresses\nmost of the above gaps, constraints, and\nneeds by establishing a dedicated entity to\noversee collecting and verifying received\nsupport information related to climate\nchange,\n\nStrengthen the ability to develop bankable\nand evidence-based projects,\n\nIt is recommended to raise the capacities\nof stakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects,\n\nIt is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment,\n\nEnhance the partnership between the public\nand private sector.\n5.6 Financial and Technical Support Provided\nby GEF Related to Climate Change\nGEF supported Jordan financially in executing\nthe following climate change activities during\nthe period 2015-2020:\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s Third National Communication to\nthe UNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv, 20122015,\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report to the\nUNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv, 2015-2017,\n\nMainstreaming Rio Convention into National\nSectoral Polices, 2015-2018,\n\nA systematic approach to Sustainable\nUrbanization and Resource Efficiency (SURE)\nin GAM, 2018-2022,\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s Fourth National Communication\nand Second Biennial Update Report to\nthe UNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv,\n2019-present.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n115\nThe above projects have been implemented with\nUNDP support, and with technical support from\nother United Nations organizations including\nUNEP and UNFCCC. In addition, the UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Program (GSP) have provided\ntechnical support for the preparation of Jordan’s\nNational Communications and the FBUR on climate\nchange through training workshops, provision\nof guidelines and guidance materials, review of\nstudies and reports and provision of online support\nand teleconference calls.\nReferences\n\nAccess to Finance: Survey for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, USAID, 2015.\n\nBuilding Capacity for the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework: What Can We\nLearn from Countries’ Experiences and UNFCCC Processes?

Also,\nnon-Annex I Parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity building, and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nThe data on support received and financial flows\nwas requested through traditional channels by\nsending official letters and formal emails and\nfollow up calls by the Ministry of Environment to all\nrelevant entities (public and private organizations,\nUN agencies, etc.)\nImprovement was witnessed in collecting\nthe needed data due to the increased level of\nengagement of the national entities in the national\nclimate change profile over the last 2 years, and\ndue to the issuance of the Climate Change Bylaw\nin 2019, which helped to institutionalize and\nstrengthen the cooperation between relevant\nentities.\nNevertheless, there is still a need for wellestablished systems for tracking data and a\nwell-defined process for the data flow from these\norganizations into the MRV system. To date some\ndata are still present only at one entity and can’t be\ntracked from other sources (the same difficulties\nas in the First BUR of 2017).\nThe Tables below (6.1-6.7) provide information\non the support received from national, bilateral,\nand multilateral sources for the period 2015-2020\nincluding funding, technology transfer, capacity\nbuilding, and technical assistance.

NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East, and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\na variety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative areas\nor governorates. The governorates are subdivided\ninto districts and sub-districts, and within each\ngovernorate there are several municipalities.\nIn order to organise the environmental and\nclimate change institutional set up, the Ministry\nof Environment was established in 2003 to\noversee all environmental affairs. Since then,\nJordan has undergone a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. Based on the\nrecommendations of this policy, the Ministry of\nEnvironment revised the Environment Protection\nLaw, no.52 of 2006 to include and strengthen the\narticles of the law related to climate change. The\nnew Environment Protection Law no.6 of year\n2017, includes provisions on climate change goals\nwhich later enabled the Ministry to develop the\nClimate Change Bylaw no.79, 2019 which aims\nmainly to regulate the coordination of national\nefforts among relevant stakeholders to implement\nmitigation and adaptation measures.\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural\nresources, a high population growth rate, the\nongoing regional conflicts, the rising cost of health\ncare and the growing expectations of people, have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable\nsocial and economic development.\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy. The Ministry\nof Energy and Mineral Resources has recently\npublished the National Energy Sector Strategy for\n2020-2030. This ten-year plan which aims at setting\nthe roadmap to increase self-sufficiency through\nutilization of domestic natural and renewable\nresources, as well as expansion of existing energy\ndevelopments, thus reducing reliance on costly\nforeign fuel imports that burden its economy.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy identified\nrenewable energy usage alongside other sources\nas follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share,\nfollowed by household, industrial and other\nservice sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share\nrespectively.\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable water\nresources. While Jordan’s population is expected to\nincrease as a result of natural population growth,\nthe country has also experienced population\ngrowth due to the influx of multiple waves of\nrefugees putting additional strain on Jordan’s\nalready severely limited water resources.\n\n3\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot, and\ndry summers and short, cool winters. The climate\nis influenced by the country’s location between\nthe aridity of the Arabian Desert and the humidity\nof the eastern Mediterranean area. January is\nthe coldest month, with average temperatures\nranging from 5°C to 10°C, while August is the\nhottest month with average temperatures ranging\nfrom 20°C to 35°C. Rainfall varies from season to\nseason and from year to year. However, about\n75% of the country can be described as having a\ndesert climate with less than 200 millimeters of\nrain annually. About 70% of the average rainfall in\nthe country falls between November and March,\nwhile the period from June to August is often\nwithout rain. However during the last ten years,\nJordan has been witnessing variations in seasons\nand average temperatures.\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions: the Highlands and Marginal\nSteppes where most of the rain-fed farming is\npracticed, the eastern desert (the badia) and the\nlowlands (Jordan Valley).\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. The\nvast majority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, Pine and Juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners, and are found mostly in\nthe northern part of Jordan where higher rainfall\nprevails. These include natural forest vegetation\nand tree plantations on farms, in the form of\nwindbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\nTransportation infrastructure in Jordan is\nconsidered to be relatively well developed within\nthe Middle East. The estimated annual growth in\ndemand for transportation and logistics ranges\nfrom 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s transportation\nand logistics sector plays a key role in Jordan’s\neconomy and contributes over 8.2% of GDP.\nLand and air transportation infrastructure is\nwell developed, with plans to improve maritime\nand railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages. Currently,\ntransportation is considered to be very energy\ninefficient, using almost half of the final energy\nconsumption of Jordan.\nJordan experiences a relatively high growth rate\nin private cars of approximately 5% per year which\nexceeds the estimated population growth. Public\ntransport (PT) in general is not well organized and\nlacks the infrastructure and interchanges required\nfor a comfortable journey. There are few mode\nchoices for PT, compared to other countries, and\nthis has led to its low share of trips. The majority of\ntrips in Jordan are made by private car. There has\nbeen some growth in the numbers of hybrid and\nelectric cars. However, in 2018, hybrid and electric\ncars still made up less than a quarter of the private\ncars in Jordan. A low share of trips are also carried\nout using regular taxis. A new innovation is the\nuse of ride-hailing apps. Their effect on mobility\nhas yet to be studied in Jordan.\n\n4\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhas improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of municipal solid waste (MSW) over\ntime. Preliminary official estimates refer to more\nthan 20-35% increase in solid waste generation\nin Jordan following the Syrian crisis, putting a\nsubstantial burden on municipalities as well as\non the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste is collected from 100 municipalities and\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km to\nthe East of Amman over an area of 2,000 Dunums,\nenough to dispose waste until 2035. In 1989, the\nGovernment of Jordan selected Swaqa landfill,\n125 km to the South-East of Amman, as a facility\nto process hazardous waste.\n2. NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for\nthe year 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines\nand the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines. The estimation of the overall national\ninventory was carried out using the 2006 IPCC\nInventory Software for non-Annex I Parties. The\nsectors and subsectors that were considered are\nthe Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use\n(IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU) and Waste.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nin units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by source and removal by sink. Indirect\nGHGs were estimated, whenever the activity data\nwere available, using the EEA Guidelines and\nmethodology.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC SAR were used.\nThe overall GHG Inventory estimates for Jordan in\n2016 were 31,063.32 Gg of CO2-equivalent (CO2eq).\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the energy sector was\nthe major emitter releasing around 76% of total\nnational emissions followed by the waste sector\nwith a contribution of around 12%.\n Energy sector\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016. Fugitive\nemissions (from oil and natural gas) were\nnegligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with a share of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture) accounted each for 10% and 10 % of\nthe total respectively.\n\n5\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n Industrial processes and product use\n(IPPU) sector\nEmissions from the industrial processes sector\nwere 3,177.42 Gg of CO2eq accounting for\n10% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016.\nThe industrial processes sector was a source of\nNMVOCs emissions and accounted for 32.61 Gg in\n2016. In addition to CO2 and NMVOCs, the sector\ngenerated emissions of HFCs with 757.29 Gg of\nCO2eq in 2016.\n Agriculture, forestry and other land use\nchange sector\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016. The emissions were\ncomposed of methane and nitrous oxide and were\ngenerated by various subcategories.\n Waste sector\nGHG emissions from the waste sector reached\n3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for 12% of\nJordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3,559.01 Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions in\n2016, while wastewater handling accounted for\n5% (188.40Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\n GHG Inventory by gas\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nresulted from the energy sector accounting\nfor 95% followed by 9% from the IPPU sector.\nMethane emissions were highest from the\nwaste sector followed by the AFOLU sector with\ncontributions of 70% and 17%, respectively.\nNitrous oxide emissions were highest from the\nAFOLU sector with 57%, followed by the IPPU,\nenergy and waste sectors, with contributions of\n18%, 13% and 12%, respectively. As expected, the\nIPPU sector contributed 100% of HFCs while the\nNMVOCs emissions resulted from the IPPU and\nthe energy sectors.\nWithin the energy sector, the main emissions\nwere in the form of CO2 (97%). Within the IPPU\nsector, the key GHGs were CO2 followed by HFCs\nwith shares of 69% and 24%, respectively. Nitrous\noxide emissions were highest from the AFOLU\nsector, with around 57% mainly from fertilizers\nand manure management. Methane emissions\nwere highest from the waste sector, with 78% and\nproduced from solid waste management.\nGHG emissions (+) and removals (-) in Gg CO2eq by Gas and by Sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\nCH4\nN2O\nHFCs\nSF6\n(Gg)\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nTotal national\nemissions and\nremovals\n24,385.37\n4,675.49\n1,245.14\n757.29\n0.022\nEnergy\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\nNA\nNO\nIPPU\n2,194.88\n0.00\n225.22\n757.29\n0.022\nAFOLU\n-896.76\n614.62\n710.85\nNA, NO\nNO\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\nNA\nNO\n\n6\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n3. GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nUpdate of the FBUR baseline scenario: the\nbaseline scenario was updated for all economic\nsectors of energy, industry, agriculture and forestry\nin addition to the waste sector, based on the\nstrategies, policies and plans prevailing in the\nJordanian context during the time of preparation\nof this SBUR (2020). This requires a projection\nof the current levels to future levels for each\ntype of activity. The newly released strategies,\npolicies, action plans and committed projects\nwere reviewed and summarized. In addition,\nall projects and actions that were part of FBUR\nbaseline scenario were reviewed to update their\nstatus. Based on this review, the most probable\nfuture trends in activities that will impact and\nshape the GHG emissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n Jordan 2025, Vision and National Strategy,\nissued in May 2015.\n The new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n The\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August 2020,\n The new Solid Waste Management Framework\nLaw issued in March 2020 and entered into\nforce in September 2020,\n National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020), issued\nin 2018,\n Jordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in\n2016.\nUpdate of FBUR GHG mitigation measures: All\nmitigation projects were reviewed and assessed\nto identify all those still valid. These projects\nstill considered valid have been updated after\nadjustments were made to their expected\nimplementation timeline. The emission reduction\nand the unit cost of emission reduction for each\nmitigation project have been recalculated taking\ninto consideration several factors, such as the\nimprovement in technologies and changes in\nprices. Net present value was used in the financial\ncalculations, by converting all present and future\nrevenues and costs over the project’s lifetime to\na base of today’s cost. The same approach was\nfollowed in calculating the CO2eq emissions\nreduction over the lifetime of the mitigation\nprojects. A discount cost of 8% was used for both\nthe cost and emission reduction calculations. Also,\nthe discounted unit cost of reduced emission\nreduction was calculated as the quotient of the\ndiscounted cost in JD to the discounted emissions\nin tonnes of CO2.\nThe update of FBUR mitigation projects resulted in\n23 valid GHG mitigation projects identified within\nthe primary energy, renewable energy, energy\nefficiency, industry, domestic solid waste and\nwastewater, and agriculture and forestry sectors\nand subsectors. Emission reduction in addition\nto the abatement cost have been recalculated for\neach proposed mitigation project.\nIt was concluded from the abatement cost analysis\nfor the valid projects from the FBUR that the\nmost feasible options are the energy mitigation\nprojects. The findings indicated that in particular\nthe projects related to energy efficiency should\nreceive the most attention. The table below shows\nthe marginal abatement cost for all mitigation\nmeasures ranked from the highest to the lowest.\n\n7\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNo.\nProject Name\nEmissions Reduction\nUnit Cost (JD/tonne\nof CO2eq)\n1\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 1)\n118.68\n2\nForestry - Introduction of new plantations in Urban Areas\n40.00\n3\nRangeland 1- Restoration of Rangeland Areas\n18.00\n4\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Northern Area\n14.50\n5\nRangeland 2- New Protected Rangeland Area as Natural Reserve\n10.00\n6\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Madaba\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.54\n7\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Baqa’a\ntertiary domestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.48\n8\nCatalytic Reduction of N2O inside the Ammonia Burner of the Nitric\nAcid Plant\n0.37\n9\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil domestic solid\nwaste landfill\n-0.50\n10\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Wadi\nArab domestic wastewater treatment plant\n-4.00\n11\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 2)\n-7.18\n12\nNatural gas distribution network in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\n-13.78\n13\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw materials\nneeded to produce clinker\n-22.90\n14\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45% of Pozzolana\n-32.00\n15\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\n-32.10\n16\nUse of biomass (domestic solid waste or/and sewage sludge) as\nalternative fuels in cement plants\n-69.30\n17\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water tanks in food\nindustry\n-108.04\n18\nLoss reduction in transmission and distribution\n-108.52\n19\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional burners in the\nsteel industry\n-110.03\n20\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 houses\n-183.64\n21\nSolar water heaters 3 - 30,000 houses\n-189.95\n22\nInsulating pipes, fittings and tanks in food industries\n-215.16\n23\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices in the Jordan valley\n-1333.00\nMarginal abatement cost for all mitigation measures (ranked from the highest to the lowest)\n\n8\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n4. DOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING,\nAND VERIFICATION\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its market readiness proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\nProposal (PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined\na plan for implementing the market readiness\ncomponents that will be necessary to support\nthe development of appropriate market based\ninstruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n A National MRV system and registry for climate\nmitigation measures,\n Designing a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n Exploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith the development of a multi-tiered integrated\nMRV system. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE). Adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors will serve in tracking progress\ntowards NDC commitments.\n5. UPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND\nRELATED NEEDS\nThe following are some recommendations for\nthe successful implementation of the climate\nchange bylaw no 79/2019, through support of\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to this bylaw:\n It is recommended that the MoEnv as chair\nof the NCCC clarify and continually stress the\nrole of different ministries and institutions in\nthe area of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n Seek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe, committee and the technical groups,\nformed according to the climate change bylaw,\nin areas relevant to their roles,\n It is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at least\n3 years) to be able to strengthen their work\nand it’s highly recommended to prepare their\nsuccessors in advance,\n Climate change directorates at different\nministries and institutions are important\nvehicles to mainstream climate change into\nthe strategies and policies of their respective\ninstitutions. As such, it is recommended that\nthe MoEnv coordinates continuously with these\ndepartments and supports them in identifying\ntheir capacity building needs.\nJordan’s FBUR to the UNFCCC was prepared and\nsubmitted in late 2017. After its submission, a\nTeam of Technical Experts (TTE) was tasked with\nits review. These experts were trained to conduct\nreviews as part of the ICA according to Decision\n2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s FBUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify the capacity-building\nneeds of developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NC’s:\n\n9\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series,\nb. Develop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources,\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis,\nd. Develop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and emission\nfactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis,\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct ongoing\nsurveys to provide accurate data and to\nintegrate climate change questions in existing\nenergy surveys that mainly focus on energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng. Enhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh. Enhance technical capacity to report on mitigation\nactions that are already implemented or\nongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress and the\nunderlying steps envisaged for the planned\nmitigation actions and when they will be\nimplemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\nIn terms of financial resources needs; the key\nchallenges in financing climate change projects\nare summarized as follows:\n Due to the Corona pandemic and its negative\neffects on health, the economy and society, it\nis expected that financial support from donors\nwill be directed to the health sector to mitigate\nthe effects of this pandemic, and this may\nnegatively affect the availability of the required\nsupport from international bodies or public\nbudgets at the national level to implement\nprojects to protect the environment in general\nand climate change projects in particular,\n Lack of climate finance framework (policy or\nstrategy),\n Banks in Jordan, in general, are interested\nin providing finance to renewable energy\nand energy efficiency projects. Banks prefer\nfinancing RE projects, particularly those which\nare of a larger size and linked to their existing\nclient base. EE and smaller sized projects are\nless preferred,\n To minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n There is a lack of appropriate financial products,\n Project developers lack technical capacity.\n\n10\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps and\nneeds:\n Expansion of the framework for the MRV system\nfor received support that addresses most of\nthe above gaps, constraints, and needs by\nestablishing a dedicated entity to oversee\ncollecting and verifying received support\ninformation related to climate change,\n Strengthen the ability to develop bankable and\nevidence-based projects,\n It is recommended to raise the capacities of\nstakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects,\n It is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment,\n Enhance the partnership between the public\nand private sector.\n \n\n11\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRoman Theater\n\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1\n1.1\nLocation and Climate\n14\n1.2\nGovernance Structure\n15\n1.3\nThe Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n15\n1.4\nSocial Indicators\n16\n1.5\nEconomic Context\n18\n1.6\nEnergy Profile\n19\n1.7\nWater Resources\n22\n1.8\nAgriculture and Forestry\n25\n1.9\nTransportation\n26\n1.10 Industry\n31\n1.11 Waste Management\n31\nReferences\n33\n\n14\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThis\nchapter\ndescribes\nJordan’s\nnational\ncircumstances that are related directly and\nindirectly to climate change.\nThe following sections will be covered:\n Location and Climate\n Governance Structure\n The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n Social Indicators\n Economical Context\n Energy Profile\n Water Resources\n Agriculture and Forestry\n Transportation\n Industry\n Waste Management\n1.1 Location and Climate\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\nvariety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot,\nand dry summers and short, cool winters. The\nclimate is influenced by the country’s location\nbetween the aridity of the Arabian Desert and\nthe humidity of the eastern Mediterranean area.\nJanuary is the coldest month, with average\ntemperatures ranging from 5°C to 10°C, while\nAugust is the hottest month with average\ntemperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C.  Rainfall\nvaries from season to season and from year to\nyear. However, about 75% of the country can be\ndescribed as having a desert climate with less than\n200 millimeters of rain annually. About 70% of\nthe average rainfall in the country falls between\nNovember and March, while June through August\nare often rainless. However during the last ten\nyears, Jordan has been witnessing changes in\nseasons and average temperatures.\nJordan can be divided into three main geographic\nand climatic areas: the Jordan Valley, the Mountain\nHeights Plateau, and the Eastern Desert, or Badia\nregion. The Jordan Valley has the country’s most\ndistinctive natural terrain. The northern segment\nof the Jordan Valley, known in Arabic as the\nGhor, is the most fertile region. Several degrees\nwarmer than the rest of the country, its year-round\nagricultural climate, fertile soils, higher winter\nrainfall, and extensive summer irrigation have\nmade the Ghor the food basket of Jordan. The\nJordan Valley is the location of the Jordan River\nwhich extends from the northern border down\nto the Dead Sea.\nThe Mountain Heights Plateau is the highlands\nof Jordan. It extends through the entire length\nof the western part of the country and separates\nthe Jordan Valley and its margins from the plains\nof the eastern desert. These areas receive Jordan’s\nhighest rainfall, and are the most richly vegetated\nin the country. This region hosts most of Jordan’s\npopulation centres, including the cities of Amman,\nMadaba, Zarqa, Irbid, and Karak.\nThe Eastern Desert or Badia Region comprises\naround 75% of Jordan. This area of desert and\ndesert steppe is part of what is known as the\nNorth Arab Desert. It stretches into Syria, Iraq, and\nSaudi Arabia, with elevations varying between 600\nand 900 meters above sea level. Climate in the\nBadia varies widely between day and night, and\nbetween summer and winter. Daytime summer\ntemperatures can exceed 40°C, while winter\nnights can be very cold, dry, and windy. Rainfall is\nminimal throughout the year, averaging less than\n50 millimeters annually. Although the regions of\nthe Badia (or desert) have common harsh desert\nclimate, similar vegetation, and sparse population\nconcentrations, those regions vary considerably\naccording to their geology.\n\n15\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.2 Governance Structure\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a\nconstitutional monarchy with a representative\ngovernment. Jordan is divided into twelve\nadministrative areas or Governorates (Figure\n1.1). Each Governorate is managed by a Governor\nwho is designated by the Cabinet based on the\nrecommendation of the Minister of Interior.\nFigure 1.1: The twelve governorates of Jordan.\nThe Governorates are subdivided into districts, subdistricts, and chief towns and these are managed by\ncivil servants of the Ministry of Interior, whose task\nis to coordinate and supervise the decentralized\nservices of other ministries under the authority\nof the Governor. Within governorates there are\nseveral municipalities, the Law of 1955 defines the\nMunicipality as being “A financially independent\nnational institution”, having a “legal personality”\nand an administrative autonomy, which is managed\nby the town council that is composed of the Mayor\nand 6 to 11 councilors.\n1.3 The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\nThe Ministry of Environment was established\nin 2003 to oversee all environmental affairs.\nSince then the country has witnessed a steady\nexpansion of the legal and institutional framework\nfor environmental protection. The Ministry of\nEnvironment became the focal point for all\ninternational environmental conventions including\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC).\nJordan is undergoing a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. The policy\nprovides guidance to sector strategies from a\n\n16\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTable 1.1: Social indicators\nclimate change perspective, and it provides a\nframework for coordination of climate change\nactivities at the national level.\nBased on the recommendations of this policy, the\nMinistry of Environment revised the Environment\nProtection Law, no.52 of 2006 to add new articles\nrelated to climate change and strengthen the\nexisting articles. The new Environment Protection\nLaw no.6 of year 2017, includes provisions on\nclimate change goals which later enabled the\nministry to develop the climate change bylaw\nno.79, 2019.\nThe climate change bylaw aims to regulate;\n(a) the coordination of national efforts among\nrelevant stakeholders to implement mitigation\nand adaptation measures, (b) the development\nof a legislative framework that maps out plans to\ncombat climate change in the Kingdom and ways\nto implement them, (c) the streaming of climate\nchange into national plans and the implementation\nof the goals and principles of the UNFCCC and the\nParis Agreement. According to the bylaw, a highlevel committee is established under the name\n“National Committee on Climate Change” which\nis chaired by the Minister of Environment and\nconsists of 16 high-level members from relevant\npublic authorities. Its functions and powers are\nidentified within the bylaw including the power\nto form technical teams from governmental and\nnon-governmental agencies represented by\ncivil society institutions, research institutions,\nuniversities and the private sector institutions.\nThe teams are mainly tasked with supporting the\nMoEnv with the NDC, the national adaptation plan\nand any other reports that should be prepared\nwithin Jordan’s international commitments and\nassessing the capacity-building needs of relevant\nentities related to climate change and contributing\nto the implementation of awareness-raising and\ncapacity-building activities.\n1.4 Social Indicators\nThe following table summarizes the main\nsocial indicators in Jordan; including the main\ndemographic data for the Jordanian population,\nrefugees and education and health indicators.\nPopulation (end of year 2019)\n10,554,000\nMale\n5,588,000\nFemale\n4,966,000\nUrban ( 90.3% )\n9,529.200\nRural ( 9.7% )\n1,024,800\nAge less than 14 years\n34.4 %\nAge between (20-45) years\n39 %\nPopulation Growth Rate\nFor years (1952- 1979)\n4.8%\nFor years (1994-2004)\n2.6%\nFor years (2004-2015)\n5.3%\n\n17\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe average household income (DOS, 2017 and 2018)\n11,242 JD\nAverage annual income for female-headed households\n9,534 JD\nAverage annual income for male-headed households\n11,519 JD\nThe gender pay gap\n17%\nThe female participation in the Jordanian labor market (World Bank,\n2020)\n15%\nHouseholds Headed by Female (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (agricultural land)\n44%\nOwn livestock\n30%\nHouseholds Headed by Male (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (Agricultural land)\n68%\nOwn livestock\n36%\nRefugees (registered as refugees) to End of Year 2019\n755,050\nRoughly Annual Cost providing for refugees (JRP, 2018)\n2.9 Billion JD = 8% of GDP\nParticipation from International Community (%) (JRP, 2018)\n5.5%\nSyrian refugees (UNHCR,2019)\n664,226\nIn urban areas\n80%\nIn (Al Za,Atari, Mrajeeb Al-farhood, Cyper City and Al-Azraq ) Camps\n20%\nEducation in Jordan (DOS,2017)\nIlliteracy rate for those above 15 years old (DOS,2017)\n5.1%\nExpenditures on education (% of GDP)\n3.6%\nHealth Indicators\nTotal annual expenditure per capita (WHO,2014)\n798 USD\nExpenditures (% of GDP) (WHO,2014)\n7.5%\nLife expectancy (DOS,2017)\n73.5\nInfant mortality rate per 1000 capita (UN, 2019)\n14\nCrude birth rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n21.5\nCrude death rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n3.9\nSource: DOS, 2019 unless otherwise indicated\n\n18\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe national accounts statistics published in 2019\nby the Central Bank of Jordan and the Department\nof Statistics (DOS) showed that there was an\nimprovement in GDP per capita at existing prices\nin 2018 while the GDP growth rate decreased.\nTable 1.3 shows the national statistics and the\npercentage of the main contributing sectors to\nGDP along the last five years (2014-2018).\n1.5 Economic Context\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural resources,\na high population growth rate, the ongoing\nregional conflicts, the rising cost of health care,\nand the growing expectations of people have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable social\nand economic development. Jordan’s economic\nindicators are illustrated in Table 1.2.\nTable 1.2: Economic indicators\nGeneral Socio-Economic Indicators for 2018\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices\n30,482 Million JD\nGDP at constant prices\n29,474 Million JD\nAnnual Growth Rates of GDP at Current Prices\n3.7%\nAnnual Growth Rates of GDP at constant Prices\n1.9%\nCompensation Annual Growth Rates of employees as a percentage of GDP\n39.0%\nGovernment final consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP at\ncurrent prices\n17.1 %\nGross Fixed Capital formation out of GDP at current prices\n20.4%\nExport of goods and services out of GDP at current prices\n35.1%\nImports of goods and services out of GDP at current prices\n53.0 %\nLabor Market Indicators for 2018 (MoL,2018)\nLabor Force (persons above the age of 15)\n1,734,248\nMales Economically Active\n56.4%\nFemales Economically Active\n15.4%\nUnemployed Males\n16.5%\nUnemployed Females\n26.8%\n\n19\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTable 1.3: National accounts statistics\nIndictors\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nGDP at Current Market Prices (million JD)\n(2016=100)\n25,595.8\n26,925.1\n27,829.6\n28,903.4\n29,984.2\nGDP at Constant Market Prices (million JD)\n(2016=100)\n26,579.7\n27,265.4\n27,829.6\n28,418.4\n28,969.8\nGDP Growth Rate at Current Market Prices (%)\n7.2\n5.2\n3.4\n3.9\n3.7\nGDP Growth Rate at Constant Market Prices (%)\n3.4\n2.6\n2.1\n2.1\n1.9\nEconomic Activity contribution (%) to GDP\nManufacturing\n16.7\n16.5\n16.4\n16.2\n17.9\nWholesale and Retail Trade, Restaurants, and\nHotels\n10.1\n9.9\n9.9\n9.8\n9.4\nTransport, Storage, and Communications\n14.4\n14.5\n14.7\n14.8\n16.5\nFinance, Insurance, and Business Services\n9.7\n9.9\n8\n8.1\n8.4\nAll categories of the 2017 budget, including\ndomestic revenues, foreign grants, current\nexpenditure, and capital expenditure, showed a\ndecline compared with the year before. The sharp\ndrop in foreign grants from 700 million JD in 2018\ncompared to 1,236.5 million JD in 2014, came as a\nshock, as Jordan depends heavily on foreign grants\nto finance its capital expenditure. The consolidated\nbudget deficit for the central government and\ngovernment owned units reached 694.8 million\nJD in 2017, compared to 825.9 million JD within\nthe same period of 2016.\nOutstanding external public debt (government\nand government guaranteed) decreased by\n2.6% to reach 11,560 million JD at the end of the\nsecond quarter of the year 2018, which represents\na decrease in the percentage to GDP from 41.7% at\nthe end of 2017 to 39.8% by the end of the second\nquarter of 2018. (MOF, 2018).\nIn contrast, net domestic debt balance increased\nby 10.6% reaching 15,005 million JD in the same\nperiod, net domestic debt as percent of GDP was\n51.6 % by the end of the second quarter of 2018\ncompared to 47.7% of GDP at the end of 2017.\nThe increase of net domestic debt was a result of\nincreasing net outstanding budgetary debt by\n1,359 million JD and increasing net outstanding\ndebt of NEPCO and WAJ by 77 million JD.\n\nThe net outstanding public debt increased by 4.4%\nfrom its level at the end of 2017, reaching about\n26,564 million JD, and representing 91.4% of the\nestimated GDP for 2018.\n1.6 Energy Profile\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy (MEMR, 2019).\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\n\n20\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe Strategy, which assumes 2018 as base year, predicts the changes in contribution of different energy\nsources in electricity generation between 2020 and 2030 as illustrated in the following charts.\nFigure 1.2: The National Energy Strategy (2020-2030) forecast for electricity generation\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the nationally\ndetermined contributions (NDCs) target by 2030.\nThe total renewable capacity by the end of 2018\nwas 1,130 MW and expected to reach 2,400 MW\nby the end of 2020, accounting for 20% of the\ngenerated electricity, compared to 1% in 2014\n(MEMR, 2018).\nIn 2014, a legislative and regulatory framework for\nrenewable energy has been set up by enacting a\nspecial renewable energy law as well as developing\nthe needed bylaws and instructions, which promote\nrenewable energy through financial incentives. As\na result, many renewable energy power purchase\nagreements were signed to supply the grid with\nelectricity generated from solar and wind. Many of\nthese projects became operational in 2015.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share followed\nby household, industrial and other services sectors\nwith 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share respectively.\nFigure (1.3) shows the final energy consumption\nin Jordan by sector for the year 2018.\n\n21\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe interruption of the Egyptian gas supply forced\nthe Jordanian government to look for new sources\nof natural gas. The construction of a Liquefied\nNatural Gas (LNG) jetty project at Aqaba port,\nthe connection to the Arab gas pipeline, and the\nleasing of a Floating Storage and Regasification\nUnit (FSRU) were successfully implemented and\nput into commercial operation in September\n2015. In 2018, 88.8% of electricity generated in\nthe Kingdom was based on imported natural\ngas. Eventually, Jordan will develop the ability to\nmeet all its needs for natural gas: for electricity\ngeneration and for industrial use.\nJordan possesses one of the largest oil shale\nreserves in\nthe\nworld with total\ndeposits\nestimated at 70 billion tonnes, containing more\nthan seven billion tonnes of oils. It is planned\nthat by 2020, 470 MW of electric generating\ncapacity will be under operation from the Attarat\nOil shale project signed in 2014 (MEMR, 2018).\nThe Attarat Power Plant is an oil shale-fueled\npower plant under construction in the Attarat\nUm Ghudran area, 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of\nAl Qatranah in Jordan.\nThis project is being developed by the Attarat\nPower Company (APCO) (which is a partnership\nbetween YTL Power International (45%), Guangdong\nYudean Group (45%) and Eesti Energia (%10)),\nto be the first oil shale fired power station and\nopen cast mine to commercially utilize Jordan’s oil\nshale. APCO has entered into a -30 year agreement\nwith NEPCO for the sale of the entire electrical\ncapacity and net electrical output following\nconstruction of the power station. The power\nplant will have 554 MW gross and 477 MW net\ncapacity and it will consist of two circulatingfluidized-bed units. It is expected to meet 10-15%\nof Jordan´s annual power demand. \nAdditionally, Jordan has developed a strategy for\nutilizing nuclear power to supply the country with\n30% of its demand for electricity by 2030, with\nsurplus destined for export. A nuclear power\ncommittee was set up in 2007 and a law was\nenacted to establish the Jordan Atomic Energy\nCommission (JAEC) and the Jordan Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (JNRC). In December\n2016, JAEC in cooperation with a consortium\nheaded by the Korean Atomic Energy Research\nFigure 1.3: Energy consumption per sector, 2018\n\n* Others: Commercial and agricultural sectors along with streetlight. Source: MEMR, 2019\n*\n\n22\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nInstitute inaugurated the 5 MW Jordan Research\nand Training Reactor. The facility is the first nuclear\nreactor in the county. It will provide radioactive\nisotopes for medical applications in Jordan, and\nwill provide training for students at the Jordan\nUniversity of Science and Technology to prepare\na skilled workforce for the country’s planned\ncommercial nuclear power reactors.\nThe country was aiming to have two 1,000 MW\nnuclear power units in operation by 2025, by the\nRosatom Company, but is now considering the use\nof small modular reactors (SMRs) instead which\nseems to be the more appropriate in bridging the\ngap in the Jordanian electricity generation mix.\n1.7 Water Resources\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable\nwater resources (MWI, 2017). While Jordan’s\npopulation is expected to increase as a result of\nnatural population growth, the country has also\nexperienced population growth due to the influx\nof multiple waves of refugees putting additional\nstrain on Jordan’s already severely limited water\nresources.\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for Municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses, as indicated by Figure 1.4.\nAccording to 2017 figures, about 46% of the\nagricultural demand is met by groundwater\nresources and the rest is met by surface and\ntreated water, as shown in Table 1.4 (MWI, 2017).\nThe majority of irrigated land in Jordan is located\nFigure 1.4: Water use by sector, 2017\n\n23\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nin the highlands and desert areas (about 52,700\nhectares), and in the Jordan Valley (about 31,600\nhectares).\nAbout 72% of the water supply for domestic uses\nis met by groundwater sources. The potable water\ninfrastructure in Jordan is not very efficient. The\nwater loss was estimated as 48% in 2017 compared\nto 43% in 2010, divided into more than 50% as\nadministrative loss and less than 50% as physical\nloss from the networks. (MWI, 2017)\nAbout 85% of the industrial demand is met by\ngroundwater resources. It is worth noting that\nindustrial water demand is projected to increase,\ndue to anticipated expansion in industrial\nenterprises as a result of Jordan’s inclusion in the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), the free trade\nagreements signed between Jordan and the\nUnited States, and the establishment of free zones\nin different regions of Jordan. These agreements\nmake Jordan a desirable destination for regional\ninvestors and manufacturers.\nWater Source\nSector\nTotal\n (MCM)\nPercentage\nof the total\nDomestic\nIndustrial\nAgriculture\nGroundwater\n338.4\n27.2\n253.2\n618.8\n59 %\nSurface water\n131.3\n2.4\n154.4\n288.1\n27 %\nTreated Wastewater\n0\n2.5\n144.2\n146.7\n14 %\nTotal\n469.7\n32.1\n551.8\n1,053.6\n100 %\nPercentage of the total\n45%\n3%\n52%\n100%\nSource: MWI, 2017\nTable 1.4: Water sources for different sectors\nGroundwater contributes about 59% to the total\nwater supply.

Jordan is now accessing nonrenewable\nwater resources from fossilized deep-water\naquifers. Underground water from the nonrenewable Disi aquifer (about 100 MCM) is being\nused to meet Jordan’s water supply for domestic\nuse, while treated wastewater (147 MCM) is being\nused mostly to meet the country’s agricultural\nneeds (MWI, 2017). Surface water supplies account\nfor 27% of Jordan’s total water supply estimated\nas 288.1 MCM in 2017.\nJordan’s population was 10.3 million in 2018\nand it is expected to reach 19 million by 2050\nunder business-as-usual scenario (DOS, 2018). The\nproportion of water used for domestic purposes\nmay increase by 50-60% in the same time period.\nBy 2025, water demand will exceed available water\nresources by more than 26%, but this deficit is\nprojected to decline to 6% when the Red SeaDead Sea project is put into operation (MWI, 2016).\nWater shortage in Jordan is a chronic problem and\nwill continue to be so for years to come. If current\ndomestic, agricultural, and industrial water-use\npractices are not improved, the water supply in\nJordan will deplete in quantity and quality over\ntime. Overdraft of groundwater and surface water\nis creating a tremendous stress on the water\nsupply in Jordan. The reduced flow of surface\nwater to the Dead Sea is also a source of concern.\nDespite Jordan’s severe water scarcity, more\nthan 94% of Jordanians have access to safe\ndrinking water and 65% have access to improved\nsanitation. These are some of the highest rates\nin the Middle East and North Africa region.\nHowever, water supply is intermittent, and the\nrooftop tanks have become an integral part of\nthe supply water storage system. Around 50% of\nJordanians are supplied by water once a week\n(24 hours) while the rest are supplied by a higher\nrate (more than 24 hours per week) (MWI, 2017).\nSince the Disi-Amman Conveyor Project became\n\n24\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\noperational in the summer of 2013, the continuity\nof water supply to Amman has improved. However,\npopulation centres in the northern governorates\nhave not benefitted fully because of increased\ndemand driven by the concentration of Syrian\nrefugees in the north. Aqaba has continuous\nwater supply from the Disi Aquifer. It is planned\nto bridge the remaining gap between demand and\nsupply through increased use of non-conventional\nwater including reclaimed water and desalinated\nseawater to be provided by the Red Sea-Dead\nSea project in the near future. The National Water\nStrategy emphasizes desalination as well as treated\nwastewater reuse to meet shortfalls in freshwater\navailability (MWI, 2017).\nThe Jordan National Water Strategy 2016-2025 has\nidentified treated wastewater, when mixed with\nsurface water, as a source of irrigation water. In\n2017, the amount of treated wastewater exceeded\n163 MCM. There are 33 public working wastewater\ntreatment plants in Jordan, most of which use\nactivated sludge. They are either operated by the\nWater Authority of Jordan (WAJ) or managed by\nthe Project Management Unit (PMU) at the Ministry\nof Water and Irrigation (MWI) through contracts\nwith the private sector. The Samra Wastewater\nTreatment Plant (WWTP) receives more than 70%\nof the country’s total generated wastewater.\nAccording to MWI figures, the ratio of industrial\nto total water use in 2017 was very small (5.2%).\nIndustrial wastewater discharged to wadis and\nother surface water bodies was first regulated by\nMartial Law issued in 1981, to force all industries\nto treat their wastewater before discharge to\nreceiving water bodies. A number of industrial\nentities divert their wastewater to the public sewer\nsystem according to WAJ regulation No. 18/1998.\n\n25\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.8 Agriculture and Forestry\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions with various landscape\nclassification (Figure 1.5) among which: the\nhighlands and marginal steppes where most of\nthe rain-fed farming is practiced, the Badia (deserts\nand rangeland; mostly livestock systems and\nsome cultivation in watersheds and from deep\nbore irrigation), and the lowlands (Jordan Valley)\nthat thinly stretches from the North West to the\nSouth West.\nFigure 1.5: Preliminary Landscape classification (Created by Natalia BOULAD, 2019)\n\n26\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. In\naddition, the agro-industrial sector is characterized\nby a large number of small enterprises. The vast\nmajority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables. More than 90%\nof irrigated areas in Jordan are dedicated to the\ncultivation of fruit trees and vegetables.\nTable 1.5: Indicators of agricultural sector\nSocio-economic Indicators for Agriculture in Jordan\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n20%\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 2018 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n6.1%\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n57 Million JD\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n1,687.9 Million\nJD\n% of active employees\n1.7%\nNon-Jordanian workers holding work permits in Agriculture in 2017 (DOS,2017)\n81,691\nNumber of Males\n79,685\nNumber of Females\n2006\nAgricultural product exports are a significant\ncontributor to Jordan’s overall export profile;\nstrong productivity and competitiveness of the\nsector are clearly shown despite its relatively\nsmall contribution of 6.1% to the country’s GDP.\nThe Jordanian agriculture exports represented\napproximately 18% of Jordan’s exports (or US$ 6.2\nbillion) in 2016. Exporting agricultural produce has\nbeen affected by the conflict in Syria, causing a\nsevere decline of around 25% as well as disrupting\noverland exports to other markets (Oxford Business\nGroup, 2015).\nAgriculture is mostly influenced by water\navailability and the ability to use advanced\npractices, technologies, and interventions to adapt\nto the impacts of climate change. Over the past two\ndecades, Jordan has witnessed a drastic drop in\nrainfall and prolonged drought periods. According\nto Jordan’s Third National Communication (TNC)\nreport outcomes, it is projected to witness a\ndecrease in precipitation by 15-60% and a rise\nof 1-4°C in temperatures. These climatic changes\nwill have serious negative consequences on\nnatural ecosystems, river basins, watersheds, and\nbiodiversity.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, pine and juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners and are found mostly\nin the northern part of Jordan where higher\nrainfall is prevailing. They include natural forest\nvegetation and tree plantations on farms, in the\nform of windbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\n1.9 Transportation\nTransportation is a key sector for Jordan, providing\na necessary service to promote economic growth.\nCurrently it is considered to be very energy\ninefficient (ACT Alliance repot, 2018), using\nalmost half of the final energy consumption of\nJordan (MEMR Brochure, 2019). The estimated\nannual growth in demand for transportation and\nlogistics ranges from 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s\n\n27\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\ntransportation and logistics sector plays a key role\nin Jordan’s economy and contributes over 8.2% of\nGDP. (Jordan Investment Commission, 2017). Land,\nmaritime and air transportation infrastructure\nare well developed, and there are plans to\ndevelop railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages.\nToday, there is an extensive 80,000 square kilometers\nroad network which spans across the Kingdom,\nconnecting it with neighboring countries.\nThere is no regular passenger rail in the country.\nThe Hejaz railway which runs the length of the\ncountry from north to south, has not been used for\nmany years and would need extensive renovation,\nto be put back into operation. The service from\nAmman to Syria was halted about 10 years ago,\nand the only passenger railway trips are for ondemand tourist trips travelling from Amman to\nJiza, a short distance to the south of the city.\nThe Kingdom serves as an important regional\ntransport\nhub between\nGulf\nCooperation\nCouncil (GCC) countries and Turkey and Europe,\nand also between Iraq and the Red Sea and\nthe Mediterranean. \nThere are three airports in Jordan: Queen Alia\nInternational Airport (QAIA), the main airport, and\nAmman Civil Airport, both in Amman Governorate\nand King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nThe only scheduled internal flights are passenger\nflights between QAIA and Aqaba.\nThe port city of Aqaba, on the Red Sea, provides\nthe only gateway to shipping for the country and\nis therefore an important centre for freight.\nAdditionally, the transport sector in the inventories\nof 2012 and 2016 was estimated to have\ncontributed to 26% and 28% respectively of the\ngreenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest\nemitter after the energy industries (electricity\ngeneration). The available national inventories,\nshow that the share of emissions for the transport\nsector are rising at an increasing rate, and that\nthe share of emissions within the inventories are\nrising, see table below.\nYear\n2006\n2010\n2012\n2016\nTransport Emissions Gg/CO2\n4,706\n5,297\n7,392\n8,787\n% of National GHG Emissions\n16\n23\n26\n28\nSource: TNC and BURs.\nTable 1.6: Transport GHG emissions from national inventories\nThe majority of trips in Jordan are made by private\ncars as indicated in the modal split in table 1.7. The\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) estimated this to be\n35% of trips for 2010, based on household surveys\nand this was backed up by the household survey\ncarried out in Amman in 2008, which estimated that\n33% of trips were made by private car. It is expected\nthat these percentages will have increased since\nthese surveys were carried out.

(GAM,\n2010)\nThere has been some growth in the numbers of\nhybrid and electric cars. However, their popularity\nis strongly dependent on government policy,\nwhich until now has not been consistent. In 2018,\nhybrid and electric cars still made up less than a\nquarter of the private cars in Jordan, as shown in\nthe table below.\n \nGasoline\nHybrid\nElectric\nTotal\nNo of Vehicles\n892,875\n244,080\n16,017\n1,153,271\n% of Vehicles\n77.4\n21.2\n1.4\n100\nSource: DOS, 2014-2018\nPublic transport (PT) in general is not well organized\nand lacks the infrastructure and interchanges\nrequired for a comfortable journey. There are few\nmode choices for PT, compared to other countries,\nthe available modes being: large bus, minibus and\nshared taxis (running on fixed routes). There is also\na lack of accessibility – with the coverage of PT\nservices in Jordan below the international average.\nIn general PT is considered suitable only for those\nwith no other option and this has led to its low\nshare of trips.\nThere is even lower share of trips carried out\nusing regular taxis, although these are not\ngenerally available outside of main centres. A\nnew innovation is the use of ride-hailing apps and\nseveral companies notably Uber and Careem, have\nbecome very popular after initial licensing issues\nwere resolved.\nAs a consequence of the introduction of ridehailing apps, a law was issued in 2017, which\nprohibits anyone from providing services relating\nto the transportation of passengers without\nTable 1.8: Number of private cars by fuel type in 2018\nA law has been passed that any new gas station,\nmust also provide electric charging points.\nHowever, until now, charging stations have not\nbeen provided in sufficient numbers to encourage\nthe uptake of electric vehicles. Currently there are\nonly around 50 charging stations for the whole\ncountry, and an agreement signed with German\nCompany e-Charge in 2018 to provide 10,000\nElectric vehicles (EV) charging stations has not yet\nbeen implemented. (Electromaps, 2020)\nThe uptake of electric cars has been slow and they\ncurrently make up only 1% of the private cars in\nJordan. As can be seen in the table below most\nof these are in Amman, although the numbers\nincreased sharply in 2019 in Zarqa and Irbid.\nTable 1.9: Electric cars registered in Amman and in Jordan\n\n29\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nbeing registered and licensed with the Land\nTransport Regulatory Commission (LTRC). Within\nthis framework, two regulations were issued in\n2018, which allowed for the complete licensing\nand registration of companies using ride-hailing\napplications: the Regulation concerning the\nTransportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications and the Instructions Regulating\nthe Transportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications.\nThere are currently about 12,500 vehicles in Jordan\nlicensed for use with ride hailing apps. Their effect\non mobility has not yet been studied in Jordan, so\nit is not clear whether trips are shifting from regular\ntaxi, public transport or private car or whether they\nare enabling “untapped demand”, trips that would\nnot otherwise be made.\nUber and Careem cars have the advantage of not\ntaking up space for parking. In fact difficulty of\nfinding parking is one reason why people may\nchoose to use their services. Additionally, since\nthey do not circulate looking for rides, there are\nexpected to be reductions in congestion, fuel\nconsumption and emissions, compared to regular\ntaxis.\nConcerning freight, the current modes used for\ntransport for imports and exports are by truck,\nplane, ship and pipeline. Truck is the most versatile,\nwith the most clearance points. Air freight is\ntransported through the three airports in Amman\nand Aqaba and shipping freight is transported\nthough Aqaba Port. Pipelines are used for import\nof natural gas through Aqaba.\nThe table 1.10 below shows the amount of\ntransported freight by weight, by mode and year.\nThere are no clear trends in the data.\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n8,840\n7,357\n6,977\n7,250\n8,564\nPlanes\n67\n76\n79\n83\n73\nShip\n21,075\n21,316\n23,361\n22,506\n20,998\nPipeline\n229\n234\n0\n0\n419\nTotal\n30,212\n28,982\n30,417\n29,839\n30,054\nIn the table below the percentage, by weight,\ntransported by each mode are compared. It can\nbe seen that the most important mode for freight\ntransport is ship, although this has been decreasing\nover the last few years. The second most important\nmode is truck, which has shown a corresponding\nincrease over the last few years. The share of freight,\nby weight, transported by plane and by pipeline,\nis minimal.\nTable 1.10: Freight transported by mode (gross weight in 1000 tonnes)\nTable 1.11: Freight transported by mode in %\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n29\n25\n23\n24\n28\nPlanes\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nShip\n70\n74\n77\n75\n70\nPipeline\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\nTotal\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n\n30\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nGovernance and Structure of the Transportation\nSector\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No.89, 2003. MoT is responsible\nfor developing the transport general policies and\nstrategies and supervising their implementation in\ncoordination and collaboration with the relevant\nentities. It is also responsible for regulating and\nmonitoring both public and freight transport. MoT\ncedes its responsibilities concerning planning and\nimplementation of transport to two organizations\nin different areas of Jordan. These are Greater\nAmman Municipality (GAM) and Aqaba Special\nEconomic Zone Authority (ASEZA).\nMinistry of Transport carries out its responsibilities\nin coordination with the related Government\norganizations described below:\n Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission (CARC)\nwas established in 2007 to replace the Civil\nAviation Authority (CAA) in accordance with\narticle 68 of the civil aviation law number 41\nof 2007. The function of CARC is to regulate\nall affairs pertaining to civil aviation including\nsafety, security, economic and environmental\naspects,\n The Transport Regulatory Commission- In July\n2020 the cabinet agreed to combine three\ntransport organizations into the Transport\nRegulatory\nCommission.\nThese\nformer\norganizations are: Land Transport Regulatory\nCommission (LTRC), the Jordan Maritime\nCommission (JMC) and the Jordan-Hejaz Railway\nCorporation,\n The Land Transport Regulatory Commission was\nestablished in 2010 to take over from the former\nPublic Transport Regulatory Commission (PTRC),\nbut with additional responsibility for freight\ntransport, by road. Its function is to regulate\nand monitor land transport and services, and\nits institutional objectives include: increasing\noperational efficiency of PT services, improving\nmobility of urban and rural populations and the\ndevelopment of environmentally sustainable PT\nservices,\n Jordan Maritime Commission (JMC) was\nestablished by royal decree in 2002 under the\ntitle of Jordan Maritime Authority. The name was\nrevised to JMC in 2014. JMC operates under the\nJordan Maritime Authority Law No. (46) Issued\nin 2006. Its function is to regulate, supervise and\ndevelop the maritime sector,\n The Jordan-Hejaz Railway Corporation was\nestablished in 1952, and it manages and\ninvests in the properties of the railway between\nMa’an and the Syrian border. It was used for\ntransporting freight between Jordan and Syria\nup until services were stopped about 10 years\nago as a result of the conflict in Syria.\nGreater Amman Municipality which has almost\n40% of the population of Jordan is responsible for\nall PT taking place completely inside its borders, an\narea of 800 km2. This responsibility was assumed\nin 2007 based on a law granting the municipality,\nplanning and regulatory authorities over PT. The\nintegrated Transportation and Traffic Management\nDirectorate was established shortly after this, to\nbring together these newly granted roles with\nGAM’s existing traffic engineering functions.\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA)\nwas created in 2001, within the Aqaba Governorate\nas a separate governance entity, covering an area\nof 375 km2 around the port city of Aqaba, including\nJordan’s entire 27 km marine coastline. ASEZA\nhas held responsibility for PT within the Aqaba\nMunicipality and between Amman and Aqaba\nsince 2000. ASEZA is also responsible for the port\nareas, the King Hussein International Airport and\nthe section of the Hejaz Railway between Aqaba\nand Ma’an and the additional link to the phosphate\nmines.\n\n31\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nMinistry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH)\nundertakes the construction and development\nof the network of roads in the country and is\nresponsible for setting plans and preparing the\nstudies and designs necessary for their construction.\nIn addition, they undertake tasks assigned by the\nGovernment of Jordan. A similar role is carried\nout within Greater Amman Municipality by the\nDepartment of Public Works and Housing within\nGAM and in Aqaba by the Department of Public\nWorks within ASEZA.\n1.10 Industry\nJordan is attractive for foreign investments in the\nMiddle East primarily due to its political stability\nand its central location in the region. Industry in\nJordan is principally dominated by manufacturing\nand mining.\nQualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) are business parks\nthat are recognized as free trade zones set up in\ncollaboration with the United States. Jordan is\none of two countries to have this arrangement,\nthe other being Egypt.\nIn Jordan, the Qualified Industrial Zones are:\n Al-Hassan Industrial Estate,\n Al-Hussein Ibn Abdullah II Industrial Estate,\n Jordan Industrial Estate Corporation,\n Jordan Cyber City,\n Al-Tajamouat Industrial Estate,\n Gateway QIZ,\n Aqaba Industrial Estate,\n Ad-Dulayl Industrial Park,\n El-Zai Ready-wear Manufacturing Company.\nThe manufacturing sector includes leather and\nfootwear manufacturing, chemicals, plastics, IT,\nfurniture, food, packaging, and manufacturing\nof engineering technology. The contribution of\nmanufacturing to GDP increased to 1347 million\nJD in the second quarter of 2019 from 1208.80 JD\nMillion in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining industry sector is one of the most\nimportant strategic industries. Mining contributes\nto the employment of local labor and caters to the\nneeds of the market for raw materials, while being\na source of hard currency.\nThe contribution of mining to GDP increased to\n175 million JD in the second quarter of 2019 from\n162.8 million JD in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining sector consists of the following subsectors:\n Phosphate and potash,\n Cement and chalk mining,\n Mining and extraction of limestone to produce\ncalcium carbonate,\n Mining and manufacturing kaolin, gypsum, and\nsilica,\n Extracting and crushing stone tablets, slabs,\nmarble, and granite stones and sand.\nPhosphate and potash are the most significant\nnatural resources in Jordan. The sector relies\nprimarily on large investments, driving several\nfirms to invest in such a promising field. The\nmining sector is the third largest industrial sector\nin terms of invested capital and the fourth largest\nsector in terms of exports in 2014. It also ranked\nfirst in terms of foreign investments in Jordan.\nMoreover, products from mining are used as\nraw material inputs for other industries such as\nfertilizers. Positive outlooks loom large as domestic\nvalue-added activities are increasingly combined\nwith investing in other areas, such as shale oil and\nuranium. This requires activating the exploitation\nof untapped raw materials in the Kingdom to\ncreate products that meet the global demand\nfor energy.      \n1.11 Waste Management\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of a high\npopulation growth rate and enforced migration.\nEconomic and cultural development has improved\nthe standard of living and changed consumer\nhabits, resulting in an increase in the volume of\nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) over time. No official\n\n32\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nstatistics have been disclosed regarding the\nincrease in solid waste generation after the influx\nof Syrian refugees. However, preliminary official\nestimates refer to more than 20-35% increase\nin solid waste generation in Jordan following\nthe Syrian crisis, putting a substantial burden\non municipalities as well as on the surrounding\necosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste collected from 100 municipalities is then\ntransported to transfer stations, sanitary landfills\nor open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded landfills\nin the country, most of which are not properly\ndesigned or operated, demonstrated by their lack\nof proper lining, leachate collection system, and\nlandfill gas management system. The only sanitary\nlandfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which receives 50%\nof the waste produced in Amman and Zarqa. AlGhabawi landfill is located 23 km to the East of\nAmman over an area of 2,000 Dunums, enough to\ndispose waste until 2035, using safe refuse/tipping\ntechniques. The Greater Amman Municipality\npurchased 1,000 Dunums from surrounding lands\nto rent out to the private sector to encourage\ninvestment in waste segregation and recycling.\nIn 1989, the Government of Jordan designated\nSwaqa landfill, 125 km to the South-East of\nAmman, as a facility to process hazardous\nwaste. The landfill is overseen and operated\nby the Ministry of Environment. The Ministry of\nEnvironment has also founded a centre in Swaqa\nlandfill to oversee the disposal of electronic waste\nin a safe manner to discourage improper storage\nand illegal re-selling. In general, the sector is in\nneed of studies to investigate the potential of\nwaste recycling.\nIt’s important to note that Bio-waste (organic\nwaste) dominates MSW; approximately 60% are\nfood waste, 14% paper and cardboards, 10%\nplastics. Therefore, MSW contains sufficient\nputrescible material which emit LFG (methane\n& CO2) for many years presenting a long-term\nexplosive and toxic hazard. Additionally, hazardous\nand non-MSW are not segregated and continue\nto reach final disposal sites posing serious health\nrisks for workers.\nIn Jordan, 48% of MSW is landfilled, 45% is\nopenly dumped and only 7% recycled. As a\nmatter of fact, recycling is mostly done by waste\npickers informally with no operational facility in\nplace. Furthermore, it is estimated that in 2034,\nMSW will reach 5.2 million tonnes (EC, 2016).\nConsidering these foreseeable challenges, in 2015\nthe Government of Jordan took a step forward\nwith the Decision No. 11392/02, and approved\nits first National Solid Waste Management\nStrategy 2015-2034 (NSWMS) in line with the\nrevised EU Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/\nEC which focuses on waste prevention and with\nthe EU-Jordan Compact 2016-2020 which sets\nthe sustainable use and management of natural\nresources as one of its priorities. The Strategy’s\nmain objective is to renovate the old, inefficient,\ncostly and environmentally unstable municipal\nsolid waste management system and convert it to\na modern and integrated one using the Three R’s\napproach (Reduce-Reuse-Recycle) within a span\nof 20 years. In particular, it seeks to prohibit the\nunsafe disposal of MSW and omit the disposal\nof industrial, construction, and medical wastes\nfrom facilities. In numeric-terms, 50% of existing\ndumpsites should be closed and 20 new transfer\nstations plus 10 new sanitary landfills should be\nconstructed (NSWMS, 2015).\n\n33\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nNo.\nSubject of Target\nProposed Targets for Jordan\nShort-term\nPeriod (20152019)\nMid-term\nPeriod (20202024)\nLong-term\nPeriod (20252034)\n1\nCatering for the emergency needs for\nMSWM due to the refugees’ influx\nDone\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n2\nCoverage of MSW street-cleaning and\ncollection services\n100%\n3\nSet-up of separate collection systems for\nrecyclables (at least paper, metal, plastic\nand glass)\n-\n100 % by 2034\n4\nPreparing for re-use and recycling of\nMSW materials (at least paper, metal,\nplastic and glass)\n-\n50% by weight\nby 2034\n5\nCease of operation of uncontrolled or\nunlicensed disposal sites\n50% by 2019\n100% by 2024\n6\nReduction of bio-waste ending-up to\nlandfills\n-\n75% by weight\nby 2034\n(according to\n2024 amounts)\n7\nRecovery of packaging waste (including\nreuse, materials’ recovery and energy\nrecovery)\n-\n25% by weight\nby 2034\n8\nRecycling of packaging waste\n-\n15% by weight\nby 2034\nReferences\n Ben-Sasson, M., Brenner, S., and Paldor, N.

Other gases\nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, such\nas sulphur oxides (SOx), included in the IPCC\nGuidelines may be included at the discretion\nof the Parties.\nThe GHG national inventory chapter addresses\nemissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide\n(N2O), methane (CH4), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons\n(PFCs). Those gases are supported by the\nsoftware and the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines. Nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)\nemissions resulting from the solvents subsector\nwere estimated using European Monitoring and\nEvaluation Programme (EMEP/EEA) air pollutant\nemission inventory guidebook 2019.\n2.2 Institutional Arrangements\nThe Ministry of Environment is the focal point for\nissues relevant to the UNFCCC and is responsible\nfor ensuring that Jordan’s commitments are met.\nPreparation of Jordan’s Second Biennial Update\nReport (SBUR) was coordinated by the Ministry of\nEnvironment in partnership with UNDP.\nAn agreement with the Royal Scientific Society\n(a national non-governmental, not-for-profit\nscientific organization) was realized to achieve\nthe work. The GHG inventory development was\naccomplished with the participation of a pool of\nnational experts representing different national\nentities, as demonstrated by the organizational\nchart in Figure 2.1.\n\n39\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.1: GHG inventory organizational chart\n\n40\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.3 Methodology and Inventory Estimation\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for the\nyears 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines and\nthe 2019 Refinement1 to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\nThe estimation of the overall national inventory\nwas carried out using the IPCC Inventory Software\nfor Parties not included in Annex I of the UNFCCC\n(ver. 2.691, released on 23 January 2020).\nThe sectors and subsectors that were considered\nare the following:\n1.\tEnergy:\n Stationary Combustion,\n Mobile Combustion,\n Fugitive Emissions.\n2.\tIndustrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU):\n Mineral Industry Emissions,\n Chemical Industry Emissions,\n Metal Industry Emissions,\n Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent\nUse,\n Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for Ozone\nDepleting Substances and Other Product\nManufacture and Use.\n3.\tAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU):\n Cropland and Forest Land,\n Emissions from Livestock and Manure\nManagement,\n N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2\nEmissions from Lime and Urea Application.\n4.\tWaste Generation, Composition, and\nManagement Data:\n Solid Waste Disposal,\n Biological Treatment of Solid Waste,\n Incineration and Open Burning of Waste,\n Wastewater Treatment and Discharge.\nIn May 2019 at IPCC 49th Session, the 2019\nRefinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories was adopted\nby the IPCC in Kyoto, Japan (Decision IPCC-XLIX-9).\nThe IPCC authors have examined a wide range\nof inventory methodologies and updated them,\nwhere scientific advances and new knowledge\nmade this necessary, following the IPCC decision.\nThe 2019 Refinement does not revise the 2006\nGuidelines, but updates, supplements and/or\nelaborates the 2006 Guidelines where gaps or\nout of date science have been identified. It will\nnot replace the 2006 Guidelines, and should be\nused in conjunction with the 2006 Guidelines.\nThe structure of 2019 Refinement is the same\nstructure as that of the 2006 Guidelines to make\nit easier for inventory compilers to use the 2019\nRefinement with the 2006 Guidelines. It includes\nan Overview Chapter and five volumes (General\nGuidance and Reporting (GGR), Energy, IPPU,\nAgriculture, AFOLU and Waste). The changes are\nindicated in each volume as Annex “Mapping\ntable” listing the types of refinements that have\nbeen done on the volume.\nIn brief, the main changes that were introduced\nto the different volumes are as follows:\n In Volume 1, adding a new guidance to all\nchapters,\n In Volume 2, introducing methodological issues\nin the stationary combustion and in the fugitive\nemissions chapters; adding new section for fuel\ntransformation and updating emission factors.\nAdditionally, updating the worksheet of the oil\nand natural gas systems,\n In volume 3, including updates for the emission\nfactors, and adding a new section for hydrogen\nproduction,\n In Volume 4, developing new guidance,\nupdating carbon stock change factors and\ndeveloping a new tier 2 method that requires\nless activity data than the current default\nmethod.\n1. All updates, supplements and/or elaborates on the 2006\nGuidelines were identified and adopted in this chapter.\n\n41\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n Finally, in volume 5, updating the default data,\nupdating the wastewater treatment chapter\nto reflect additional types of treatment and\ndisposal systems.\nThe guidance on appropriate estimation methods\nwithin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines that includes\ncross-sectoral good practice guidance for\ninventory preparation were consulted. It includes\nmethods for collection of activity data, key\ncategory analysis, quality assurance and control,\nand inventory planning and documentation.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nand in units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by sources and removals by sinks. Most\nsectors and subsectors used Tier 1.\nIndirect GHGs were estimated, whenever the\nactivity data were available, using the EMEP\nGuidelines and methodology.\nFor reporting purposes, the notation keys NO\n(not occurring) or NE (not estimated) and NA\n(not applicable) were used as necessary in the\ninventory reporting tables.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC Second Assessment Report\n(SAR) temporal horizon 100 years were used. The\nfollowing sections report Jordan’s GHG inventories\nby sector and on a gas by gas basis.\n2.4 GHG Inventories by Sector\nAccording to the overall GHG Inventory estimates,\nJordan contributed 31,063.32 Gg of CO2eq in 2016.\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the Energy Sector is the\nmajor emitter accounting for around 76% of\ntotal national emissions followed by the Waste\nSector with a contribution of around 12%. GHG\nemissions by sector in 2016 are shown in Table\n2.1 and Figure 2.2.\nTable 2.1: GHG aggregate emissions in Gg CO2eq by sector, 2016\nCategories\nEmissions\nGg CO2 eq\nPercentage of the\noverall\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n31,063.32\n100%\nEnergy\n23,649.47\n76.13%\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use\n3,177.42\n10.23%\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n428.71\n1.38%\nWaste\n3,807.73\n12.26%\n\n42\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.2: GHG aggregate emissions (%) by sector, 2016\nIn the sections below, a detailed description is\ngiven for the emissions resulting from the sectors\nin year 2016.\n2.4.1 Energy sector\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP and\nplacing a strain on its economy (MEMR, 2019). The\nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the NDCs\ntarget by 2030. The total renewable capacity by\nthe end of 2018 was 1,130 MW and was expected\nto reach 2,400 MW by the end of 2020, accounting\nfor 20% of the generated electricity, compared\nto 1% in 2014 (MEMR, 2018). The largest energy\nconsumer in 2018 was the transport sector with a\n49% share followed by household, industrial and\nother services sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14%\nshare respectively.\n\n43\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nEnergy-related activities have a dominant share\nof GHG emissions in Jordan. Emissions from this\nsector are classified into two main categories:\n Emissions from fuel combustion,\n Non-combustion (fugitive) emissions.\nGHGs Emissions in 2016\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016, resulting primarily\nfrom fuel combustion activities, as shown in Table\n2.2. Fugitive emissions (from oil and natural gas)\nwere negligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with shares of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial,\nand Agriculture) accounted for 10% and 10%\nrespectively of the total, as indicated in Figure 2.3.\nTable 2.2: Energy sector aggregated emissions, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\nCH4\nN2O\nAggregated\nemissions in\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nGg\nGg of CO2 eq\nENERGY SECTOR\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\n23,649.47\nFuel Combustion Activities\n23,032.67\n60.10\n155.39\n23,248.15\nEnergy Industries\n8,956.12\n4.35\n9.12\n8,969.59\nManufacturing Industries and Construction\n2,432.06\n1.41\n7.01\n2,440.47\nTransport\n8,609.48\n43.73\n133.50\n8,786.71\nOther Sectors (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture)\n2,354.95\n8.88\n4.40\n2,368.23\nNon-Specified\n680.06\n1.73\n1.36\n683.15\nFugitive emissions (Oil and Natural Gas)\n21.92\n379.29\n0.10\n401.31\nFigure 2.3: Shares of emission (%) per subsector within the energy sector, 2016\n\n44\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nInternational Bunkers, 2016\nAs per Decision 17/CP, to the extent possible, and\nif data are available, non-Annex I Parties should\nreport emissions from international aviation and\ninternational water-borne navigation separately\nin their inventories. Emission estimates from these\nsources should not be included in the national\ntotals and should be reported only as information\nitems.

The emissions were\ngenerated mainly from:\n Mineral Industry (mainly cement production),\n Products used as substitutes for Ozone Depleting\nSubstances (ODS) (mainly Refrigeration, Air\nConditioning, and Fire Protection),\n The Chemicals Industry (mainly Nitric Acid\nproduction Subsectors.\nThe IPPU sector was a source of NMVOCs emissions\nand accounted for 32.61 Gg. In addition to CO2\nand NMVOCs, the sector generated emissions of\nHFCs with 757.29 Gg of CO2eq.

The southern and eastern parts of the\ncountry are arid with hot dry summers and cold\ndry winters. Temperature increases towards the\nsouth, with exceptions in some southern highlands.\nPrecipitation is extremely variable and is confined\nlargely to the winter and early spring seasons. It\nranges from over 500mm in the highlands to less\nthan 50mm in the east. The long-term average\nannual precipitation is 8,317 million cubic meters,\nof which, about 92.5% is lost to evaporation. The\nEastern Desert (also known as the Badia) that\nlies east of the mountainous region and covers\nabout 80% of the land area of Jordan has a low\nprecipitation (the Updated Rangeland Strategy\nfor Jordan, 2014).\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture 2018\nstatistical report, cultivated land accounts for (2.32.8 million dunums). On average, irrigated areas\ncomprise around 1 million dunums (60% of the\ncultivated areas), whereas on average rainfed areas\nmake up around 1.5 million dunums (40% of the\ncultivated areas).\nThe contribution of agriculture to the GDP, in\nrelative terms, declined sharply from 40% in\nthe 1950s to 4.8% in 2018. Irrespective of how\nhumble the contribution of agriculture is to GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of the agricultural\nsector stems from the fact that it is not only a major\nsource of food, particularly dairy products, fruits\nand vegetables, but it is also a source of livelihood\nfor around 25-30% of the total poor population\n(livestock keepers, smallholder farm households,\nand landless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas (World Bank- Technical Note, 2018).\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016, acting as a net\nemission source. The emissions were composed\nof methane and nitrous oxide and were generated\nby various subcategories. AFOLU emissions and\nremovals are shown in Table 2.6 and Figure 2.5.\n\n47\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.6: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nNet\n(Gg CO2 eq)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nAgriculture, Forestry, and\nOther Land Use\n-896.76\n614.6\n710.9\n428.71\nLivestock\nNA\n610\n20.44\n630.45\nLand\n-922.54\nNA\nNA\n-922.54\nAggregate sources and nonCO2 emissions sources on land\n25.78\n4.611\n690.4\n720.80\nFigure 2.5: Emissions of the AFOLU sector (Gg CO2eq), 2016\n2.4.4 Waste sector\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhave improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of MSW over time. No official statistics\nhave been disclosed regarding the increase in\nsolid waste generation after the influx of Syrian\nrefugees. However, preliminary official estimates\nrefer to more than a 20-35% increase in solid waste\ngeneration in Jordan following the Syrian crisis,\nputting a substantial burden on municipalities as\nwell as on the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan.\nSolid waste collected from 100 municipalities\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km\nto the east of Amman, and covers an area of over\n2,000 Dunums, enough to dispose waste until 2035,\nusing safe refuse/tipping techniques. Additionally,\nGg CO2eq\n\n48\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nthe Greater Amman Municipality purchased 1,000\ndunums from surrounding lands to rent out to the\nprivate sector to encourage investment in waste\nsegregation and recycling.\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nIn 2016, GHG emissions from the waste sector\nreached 3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for\n12% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3559.01 Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions,\nwhile wastewater handling accounted for 5%\n(188.40Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\nTable 2.7 and Figure 2.6 show 2016 emissions\nbreakdown by the waste sector.\nTable 2.7: Emissions of the waste sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nTotal CO2eq\n(Gg)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\n3807.73\nSolid Waste Disposal\nNA\n3,559.01\nNA\n3,559.01\nIncineration and Open Burning of Waste\n32.66\n23.11\n4.56\n60.32\nWastewater Treatment and Discharge\nNA\n39.38\n149.02\n188.40\nFigure 2.6: Emissions (%) by the waste sector, 2016\n\n49\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.5 GHG Inventory by Gas\n2.5.1 GHG Emissions in 2016\nThe share of carbon dioxide was the largest with a contribution of 24,385.37 Gg, accounting for 79%\nof all GHGs emissions, followed by CH4 with a contribution of 4,675.49 Gg of CO2eq at only 15%, as\nindicated in Figure 2.7.\nFigure 2.7: National emissions (%) by gas, 2016\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nwere produced by the energy sector accounting for\n95%, followed by 9% from the IPPU sector. Methane\nemissions were highest from the waste sector\nfollowed by the AFOLU sector with contributions of\n70% and 17%, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions\nwere highest from the AFOLU sector with 57%,\nfollowed by the IPPU, Energy and waste sectors, with\ncontributions of 18%, 13% and 12%, respectively.\nAs expected, the IPPU sector contributed 100% of\nHFCs while the NMVOCs emissions resulted from\nthe IPPU and the energy sectors.\nWithin the energy sector, the main emissions were\nin the form of CO2 (97%). Within the IPPU sector,\nthe key GHGs were CO2 followed by HFCs with\nshares of 69% and 24%, respectively. Nitrous oxide\nemissions were highest from the AFOLU sector, with\naround 57% mainly from fertilizers and manure\nmanagement.

This approach\nprovides estimates of CO2 to compare with\nestimates derived using a Sectoral Approach. The\nReference Approach provides an upper bound\nto the Sectoral Approach ‘1A Fuel Combustion’,\nbecause some of the carbon in the fuel is not\ncombusted but is released as fugitive emissions\n(as leakage or evaporation in the production\nand/or transformation stage). Calculating CO2\nemissions with the two approaches can lead to\ndifferent results for some countries.\nThe Reference Approach was used to calculate\nenergy sector emissions in 2016 and the results\nwere compared to those of the Sectoral Approach.\nThe gap between the two approaches should\nbe relatively small (5% or less). For Jordan, the\ncalculated differences were acceptable; less than\n5%, as indicated in Table 2.11.\nTable 2.11: Reference approach vs sectoral approach for the year 2016\nYear\nReference Approach\nSectoral\nDifference\nCO2 Emissions (Gg)\n%\n2016\n24,017.75\n23,043.18\n4.23\nGHG emissions were also estimated using the\nReference Approach for the time series (2013-2016)\n(Table 2.12 and Figure 2.9).\nThe outcomes indicated a steady increase in\nthe energy consumption for 2013-2016, and\nan unexpected decrease in 2015 emissions was\nnoticed which was due to a change in the energy\nmix of electricity generation in the form of using\nnatural gas a less carbon intense fuel than Diesel.\nTable 2.12: Energy consumption and emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\nYear\nEnergy Consumption (TJ)\nCO2 (Gg)\n2013\n317,581.57\n22,772.64\n2014\n327,784.75\n24,136.90\n2015\n345,185.21\n23,936.91\n2016\n379,660.75\n24,017.75\n\n55\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.9: Variations in emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\n2.8 Time Series and Comparison between\nCurrent and Previous Inventories\nThe time series is a central component of the\ngreenhouse gas inventory because it provides\ninformation on historical emissions trends and\ntracks the effects of strategies to reduce emissions\nat the national level. As is the case with estimates for\nindividual years, emission trends should be neither\nover nor underestimated as far as can be judged.\nAll emissions estimates in a time series should be\nestimated consistently, which means that as far\nas possible, the time series should be calculated\nusing the same method and data sources in all\nyears. Using different methods and data in a time\nseries could introduce bias because the estimated\nemission trend will reflect not only real changes\nin emissions or removals but also the pattern of\nmethodological refinements. Chapter five, volume\none of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was consulted\nin terms of good practices ensuring time series\nconsistency.\nRecalculations were carried out for the years\n2010 and 2012. Also, techniques for combining\nor “splicing” different methods or data sets to\ncompensate for incomplete or missing data were\nused for estimating years the 2000 and 2006.\nFigure 2.10 and Table 2.13 provides an overview\nof time series estimation:\n As expected, an increase in GHG emissions\nwas noticed between the different years due\nto population growth and increased economic\nactivities,\n The category 1.B - Fugitive emissions from fuels\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 were recalculated\nusing the correct emissions factor for onshore\n- developing country and this resulted in new\nfigures (from 1.02 and 1.26 Gg CO2eq to 235.98\nGg CO2eq and 336.75 Gg CO2eq respectively),\n Also, the 2.D - Non-Energy Products from Fuels\nand Solvent Use category was recalculated\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 due to an error in\nemission factor unit conversion. Results were\nmodified from 208.80 Gg CO2eq and 226.88 Gg\nCO2eq to 2.85 Gg CO2eq and 3.09 Gg CO2eq,\n All sectors for 1994 will be calculated as part of\nthe third BUR. Collecting data was challenging\ndue to difficulties in getting the activity data in\ndue time,\n The IPPU and AFOLU sectors for the years\n2000 and 2006 were not estimated due to\ndifficulties in getting the activity data in due\ntime. Recalculation will be carried out as part\nof the third BUR.\n\n56\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.10: Comparison between time series for the energy and the waste sectors\nThe above figure illustrates a comparison between\nthe energy and waste sectors for the years of 2000,\n2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016.

Non-Annex I Parties are\nencouraged (Decision 17/CP.8), to the extent\npossible, to undertake any key category analysis\nto assist in developing inventories that better\nreflect their national circumstances. The analysis\nwas carried out based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines\nand Software. Jordan used “level” key category\nanalysis where the contribution of each source or\nsink category to the total national inventory level\nwas calculated. The key categories according to the\nguidelines are those that, when summed together\nin descending order of magnitude, add up to 95%\nof the sum of all level assessment.\nIn categories that are identified as key, parties\nshould try to use a recommended method, in\naccordance with the corresponding decision tree\nin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It is recommended\nthat Jordan searches for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to the\nextent possible and based on software readiness\nand national circumstances, Tier 2 methods in the\ncategories identified as key.\nAs shown in Table 2.14 for the year 2016, the key\ncategory analysis resulted in thirteen subcategories;\nthe top four accounting for around 64.9% of all\nemissions, were:\n Fuel Combustion Activities subcategories:\nEnergy Industries (Gaseous Fuels), Road\nTransportation, Energy Industries (Liquid Fuels),\nand other sectors (commercial/institutional and\nresidential-Liquid Fuels),\n The solid waste management subcategory.\n\n58\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.14: Key category analysis (level assessment), 2016\nA\nB\nC\nD\nF\nG\nIPCC\nCategory\ncode\nIPCC Category\nGHG\n2016\nEmissions\nCO2eq (Gg)\n2016\nEmissions\nLevel from\nthe Given\nCategory\nCumulative Total\n% of Column F\n1.A.3.b\nRoad Transportation\nCO2\n8566.56\n0.26\n26.4%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nGaseous Fuels\nCO2\n6495.61\n0.20\n46.3%\n4.A\nSolid Waste Disposal\nCH4\n3559.01\n0.11\n57.3%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nLiquid Fuels\nCO2\n2460.51\n0.08\n64.9%\n1.A.4\nOther Sectors - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2365.46\n0.07\n72.1%\n2.A.1\nCement production\nCO2\n1751.43\n0.05\n77.5%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n1669.84\n0.05\n82.7%\n3.B.1.a\nForest land Remaining\nForest land\nCO2\n-922.77\n0.03\n85.5%\n2.F.1\nRefrigeration and Air\nConditioning\nHFCs,\nPFCs\n762.23\n0.02\n87.9%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Solid\nFuels\nCO2\n737.23\n0.02\n90.1%\n1.A.5\nNon-Specified - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n680.06\n0.02\n92.2%\n3.A.1\nEnteric Fermentation\nCH4\n574.08\n0.02\n94.0%\n3.C.4\nDirect N2O Emissions\nfrom managed soils\nN2O\n510.55\n0.02\n95.6%\n2.10 Uncertainty Analysis\nThe uncertainty analysis is one of the main activities\nof the inventory process. Uncertainty information\nis intended to help prioritize efforts to improve the\naccuracy of inventories and guide decisions on the\nmethodological choice.\nThe analysis was carried out based on IPCC 2006\nGuidelines and Software. “Approach 1: Propagation\nof Error” was used. Approach 1 is based upon error\npropagation and is used to estimate uncertainty in\nindividual categories in the inventory as a whole,\nand in trends between 2016 and the base year\n2010. The uncertainty analysis was based on\nTier 1 approach and covers all source-categories\nand all direct greenhouse gases. The uncertainty\nestimation for the activity data and emission factors\nwas based on typical values of the IPCC.\nThe results indicate that net emissions in 2016\nwere 26,794.86 Gg of CO2eq with an uncertainty\nof ±5%, which corresponds to a 95% probability\n\n59\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nrange of 27,598.71 to 25,991.01 Gg of CO2eq. Based\nupon the total base year of 2010 and year 2016\ninventories, the average trend is a 34% increase\nin emissions from 2010 to 2016. The uncertainty\nin the trend is ±4% (percentage points), which\ncorresponds to a 95% probability range for the\ntrend with respect to base year emissions.\n2.11 GHG Inventory Quality Control/Quality\nAssurance and Review\nJordan acknowledges the need for having a manual\nfor national QC/QA procedures for GHG inventory\nestimation. This has been listed in Jordan’s future\nimprovement plans (section 2.12). Also, during the\npreparation of the GHG Inventories, the inventory\nteam and the BUR project management team\ncarried out the following tasks:\n Overall assessment technical reviews, and\naccuracy checks performed by the compilers\nto ensure consistency, accuracy, completeness\nand avoid double counting,\n Checking the accuracy of data input from the\noriginal references and confirm that correct\nreferences were used as well as ensuring that\nno transcription errors exist,\n Checking that parameter and emission units\nare correctly recorded and that appropriate\nconversion factors are used and checking as\nwell for consistency if more than one expert\nused same conversions and factor among\nvarious subsectors,\n Checking that the movement of inventory data\namong processing steps is correct,\n Checking that there is detailed internal\ndocumentation to support the estimates and\nenable full reconstruction of the estimate,\n Checking that inventory data are archived and\nstored to facilitate detailed review,\nIn terms of quality assurance the national GHG\ninventory chapter was subjected to an international\nreview which was coordinated by the UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Program (GSP) and was conducted\nfrom 7 to 13 October 2020 by Dr. Carlos López,\nconsultant in national GHG emissions inventories.\nThe review examined mainly the adherence of the\ninventory chapter to the requirements indicated in\nthe UNFCCC Decision 17/CP.8 Annex, the UNFCCC\nDecision 2/CP.17 Annex III, and to the advice of\nthe IPCC Guidelines and Guidance. The outcomes\nof the review resulted in several direct actions\nto improve the chapter and an inventory future\nimprovement plan (IIP); described in details in the\nfollowing section.\n2.12 Future Improvement Plan\nSeveral actions were identified by the GSP\nreviewer. The improvements are listed below\nand are rated according to urgency as; immediate,\nshort term and long term actions:\n\tThe activity data used in the estimate, especially\nin the subcategories identified as key or\nsignificant , should be improved as much as\npossible, in order to use tier 2. Also, actions to\nimprove data, methods, EF and other estimation\nparameters (OEP) should be prioritized in\nkey categories to use tier 2 (especially in the\nsubcategory 2F1a, 4A Solid Waste Disposal,\n3A1c Sheep and 3B Land). (short term and\nlong term),\n\tThe documentation boxes and worksheet\nremarks included within the software should\nbe added. (short term),\n\tThe completeness of the inventory should be\nimproved by: (short term to long term),\n- Improving the estimation and reporting of\nprecursor gas emissions in future inventory\nsubmissions (activity data and EF are mostly\navailable),\n- Incorporating among the precursor gases,\nthe estimation of NH3 emissions.

Name and description of the mitigation\naction, including information on the nature\nof the action, coverage (i.e. sectors and gases),\nquantitative goals and progress indicators;\nb.\nInformation on methodologies and\nassumptions;\nc. Objectives of the action and steps taken or\nenvisaged to achieve that action;\nd.\nInformation\non\nthe\nprogress\nof\nimplementation of the mitigation actions\nand the underlying steps taken or envisaged,\nand the results achieved, such as estimated\noutcomes (metrics depending on type of\naction) and estimated emission reductions,\nto the extent possible;\ne. Information on international market\nmechanisms.\n\tParties should provide information on the\ndescription\nof\ndomestic\nmeasurement,\nreporting and verification arrangements.\n(Detailed in chapter4 of this report).\nBased on the above requirements, this chapter has\nbeen prepared to update the baseline scenario\nand the FBUR mitigation measures as briefly\ndescribed in the following paragraphs.\n\tUpdate of the baseline scenario: A baseline\nscenario reflects a future in which there are\nno policies or programs designed to encourage\nor require actions that reduce GHG emissions\nor enhance carbon sinks.\n The FBUR baseline scenario was updated\nfor all economic sectors of energy, industry,\nagriculture and forestry in addition to the\nwaste sector, based on the strategies, policies\nand plans prevailing in the Jordanian context\nduring the time of preparation of this SBUR\n(2020). This requires a projection of the current\nlevels to future levels of each type of activity.\nThe newly released strategies, policies, action\nplans and committed projects were reviewed\nand summarized. In addition, all projects and\nactions that were part of FBUR baseline scenario\nwere reviewed to update their status. Based on\nthis review, the most probable future trends in\nactivities that will impact and shape the GHG\nemissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n-\nThe new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n-\nThe\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August\n2020,\n-\nThe\nnew\nsolid\nwaste\nmanagement\nframework law issued in March 2020 and\nentered in force in September 2020,\n-\nNational Renaissance Plan (2019-2020),\nissued in 2018,\n-\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n- The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in 2016,\n Update of FBUR mitigation measures: All\nFBUR mitigation projects were reviewed and\nassessed to identify all those still valid. The\nvalid projects were updated, after adjustments\nwere made in their expected implementation\ntimeline. The emission reduction and the unit\ncost of emission reduction for each mitigation\nproject have been recalculated taking into\nconsideration several factors such as the\n\n65\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nimprovement in technologies and changes\nin prices. Net present value was used in the\nfinancial calculations, by converting all present\nand future revenues and costs over the project’s\nlifetime to a base of today’s cost. The same\napproach was followed in calculating the CO2eq\nemissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nmitigation projects. A discount rate of 8% was\nused for both the cost and emission reduction\ncalculations. Also, the discounted unit cost of\nreduced emission reduction was calculated as\nthe quotient of the discounted cost in JD to\nthe discounted emission in tonnes CO2. The\nupdated FBUR mitigation projects include\n23 GHG mitigation measures in the sectors\nand subsectors of primary energy, renewable\nenergy, energy efficiency, industries, domestic\nsolid waste and wastewater, and agriculture\nand forestry.\n3.2 Baseline Scenario for the Different Sectors\n3.2.1 Baseline scenario for the energy sector\nA. The Current Status of the Infrastructure\nEnergy Projects Listed in the FBUR\nA.1 The delayed energy infrastructure projects\nExpansion of Jordan Oil Refinery Project\nA decision was made to implement an expansion\nto Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC),\nin order to improve the specifications of the\npetroleum products and to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products. Having\nan environmental management system is a\nrequirement from the IFC to grant the JPRC\nloan for expansion. Early 2020, the Refinery\nCompany published a call for services, specifically\nto undertake the planning of an environmental\nmanagement system, that includes environmental\nimpact assessment, environmental audit, health\nand safety and risk assessment. Due to COVID-19,\nthe implementation of this assessment was\ndelayed and accordingly the expansion has been\ndelayed. The expected date of completion for the\nproject is now 2025, instead of 2022.\nConstruction of the Iraqi Crude Oil Pipeline\nDue to the political situation in the region a delay\noccurred in the construction of the Iraqi crude oil\npipeline, which was supposed to transport Iraqi\ncrude oil across Jordanian territory to the export\nterminal in Aqaba with a capacity of 1 million\nbarrels/day, in addition to a branch to supply\nJordan Oil Refinery with 150 thousand barrels/\nday. The date of completion for the construction\nand operation of the pipeline is expected to be\n2027 instead of 2022.\nOil shale surface retorting projects\nAll the companies working in surface retorting\nof oil shale are still unable to fulfill the agreed\nobligations in their production schedules, due to\nchanges in economic feasibility. All the oil shale\ncompanies have been asked to postpone their\nproject development period some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed.\nNuclear Power Plant of 1,000 MW\nIn February 2019, the Ministerial Council took a\ndecision to cancel the construction of the nuclear\npower plant with a proposed capacity of 1,000\nMW, which was planned to be operational and\ncontributing to the electricity system in 2023.\nThis is due to the over committed electricity\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW. The council\ndecided to consider the introduction of smaller\nreactors instead.\nThe third round of the renewable energy projects\nThe decision was taken in the Ministry of Energy\nand Mineral Resources to delay the third round of\nthe renewable energy projects which consists of\nfour 50 MW solar and two 50 MW wind projects\ndue to the decrease in the growth rate of electricity\ndemand, which was 0-1.5% during the period\n2017-2019, and due to the over-committed\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW.\n\n66\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nA.2 The completed infrastructure projects\nMany infrastructure projects, policies, laws and\nbylaws have witnessed successful implementation\nas follows.\nCrude oil and oil products storage\nAll of the strategic projects to increase the storage\ncapacities of crude oil and oil products were\ncompleted on EPC basis and put in operation as\nplanned at the end of 2017, these projects are\nlisted below:\n-\nConstruction of 100 thousand tonnes\nstorage capacity for crude oil in Aqaba,\n-\nConstruction of strategic storage capacities\nfor light oil products with a capacity of\n250-300 thousand tonnes, and 8 thousand\ntonnes for LPG in Almadonah area, in central\nJordan,\n-\nEstablishment of the Oil Logistics Company\nin 2017 to secure the strategic storage\ncapacity of oil and oil products needed for\nthe country.\nElectricity generation and transmission projects\n\nThe new Zarqa Power Plant Project was\ncompleted, with a capacity of 485 MW, at\nthe site of the previous Hussein Power Plant.\nThe plant owned by ACWA Power Company,\noperates mainly on natural gas as primary\nfuel and diesel as secondary fuel. The project\nwas successfully completed and put into\noperation in the year 2019.\n\nThe first electric power plant using coke and\ncoal was completed in Al Karak governorate\nof Jordan, with a generation capacity of 30\nMW. The plant is equipped with the latest\nequipment and technologies in addition\nto the adherence to the internationally\nrecognized environmental standards. The\nplant was put into operation in 2018.\n\nIn mid-2019, the Green Corridor Project\nwas completed and put into operation. The\nproject’s aim is to transmit between 800-1,000\nMW of electricity from renewable energy\nsources, from the south to the load centres\nin other regions in Jordan. This project will\naccommodate electrical power generated\nfrom new renewable energy sources.\nNatural gas projects\nThe construction of the natural gas pipeline in\nthe north of Jordan, designed to import natural\ngas from Nobel Energy Company was completed\nin 2020. The pipeline was constructed according\nto the agreement signed between the National\nPower Company (NEPCO) and Nobel Energy in\n2018.\nRenewable energy projects\nA remarkable achievement in the completion\nof renewable energy projects for electricity\ngeneration has been achieved. All the renewable\nenergy projects listed and considered in the\nbaseline scenario in the FBUR and planned to be\nexecuted by the end of 2019, were completed in\ndue time, as planned.\nBy the end of 2019, 850 MW of solar and 375 MW\nof wind projects were connected to the grid,\nincluding 150 MW net metering projects and\n130 MW wheeling projects.

The Energy Baseline Scenario in the SBUR for\nthe Period 2016-2066\nIn order to build the energy demand and supply\nbaseline scenario in the SBUR, several matters\nand issues which will affect and drive the energy\nscenario will be considered. The most important\nof these are as follows.\nB.1 The over commitment of electricity generation\ncapacity in the country\nThe generation capacity of thermal power plants as\nof the end of September 2019 reached (4,257 MW)\nand while the generation capacity of renewable\nenergy projects (solar and wind) reached (1,130\nMW). Comparatively the maximum peak load for\nthe first half of 2019 was around 3,000 MW.\nThis volume of available generating capacity is\nlarge compared to the maximum peak load and\neven, considering the capacity of conventional\ngeneration stations only, exceeds it by 30%.\n This is in contrast to the internationally recognized\npractices in this industry, which has limits of 10%\n-15%, especially in electrical systems that are\nconnected to electric networks similar to the\nJordanian network. This causes significant costs for\nthe electrical system, since there is a commitment\nto pay for the cost of capacity for the power stations,\n\n69\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\neven if their operation is suspended, according to\nthe Energy Purchase Agreement, which is based on\nthe principle of take or pay. Continuous operation\nof the power stations is not needed as a result of\nthe decline in growth rates in electricity demand\ndue to many reasons, among these:\n\nA high growth rate for the peak load of 6.2%\nannually was adopted in the electrical system\nexpansion planning. However, the actual\ngrowth rate during the three years of (20172019) ranged between (0% - 2%). This was\na result of consumers’ tendency to increase\nthe use of energy-saving technologies, and\nto expand dependence on self-generation\nthrough small and large renewable energy\nprojects, and\n\nEconomic growth decline as a result of\npolitical conditions in the region.\nB.2 The new National Energy Strategy for the\nperiod 2020-2030\nThe Ministry of Energy issued a new energy\nstrategy for the period 2020-2030 and it was\napproved by the Ministerial Council in March 2020\ntogether with a framework implementation plan.\nThe new energy strategy re- estimated the annual\ngrowth rate of the primary energy demand for\nthe period 2020-2030 to be 0.9%, and the annual\ngrowth rate of the electricity demand for the same\nperiod to be 1.1% compared to 2.4% and 4.1% for\nprimary energy demand and electricity demand\nrespectively considered in the previous energy\nstrategy (2015-2025). Table (3.3) illustrate the\ncomparison of the electricity demand in GWh\nbetween the two strategies.\nTable 3.3: Comparison of electricity demand (GWh) within the two energy strategies\nYears\n2020\n2023\n2025\n2030\nEnergy Strategy 2020-2030\n17,672\n17,950\n18,686\n19,701\nEnergy Strategy 2015-2025\n23,150\n26,470\n28,900\n34,990\nThe new strategy aims to achieve energy security\nfor the country and to increase the contribution of\nthe local resources in the energy mix. It also aims\nto decrease the heavy burden of the energy cost\non the national economy and to study the impacts\nof renewable energy projects on the electricity\ngeneration system.\nConsidering the above mentioned issues and facts,\nand according to the previous energy strategy\n2015-2025 and the new energy strategy 2020-2030\nwith their components and the implementation\nplans; the most probable baseline scenario in the\nenergy sector will be based on the adopted goals,\npolicies, and laws, and the planned and committed\nprojects within the energy strategies.\nPolicies, projects and activities considered in the\nbaseline scenario up to 2030 and beyond to 2066\nThe most reliable policies, projects and activities\nconsidered in the baseline scenario up to 2030 and\nbeyond to the year 2066 are summarized in the\nfollowing sections.\nThe Field of Oil and Oil Products\nThe main policy: Securing the needs of the\nKingdom’s crude oil and oil products. Securing the\nKingdom’s oil products needs will be achieved by\nthe following:\n\nJordan Petroleum Refinery will continue to\nproduce 14 thousand tonnes per day (100\nthousand barrels) to meet 60% of the need\nof the domestic market for oil products,\naccording to 2015 statistics. The remainder\nof the needs of the domestic market for oil\nproducts will be imported. This arrangement\nis proposed to last up to 2040.\n\nImplement the expansion of the Jordan\nPetroleum Refinery in order to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products and\nimprove the specifications of petroleum\nproducts. The expansion is planned to be\ncompleted by 2026.\n\n70\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nContinue to meet Jordan’s needs for crude\noil by importing oil from Saudi Arabia by sea,\nthen transporting it in oil tankers to the oil\nrefinery in the centre area of the kingdom.\nThis is planned to continue up to 2027.\n\nConstruction of the Iraqi crude oil pipeline\nto export Iraqi crude oil across Jordanian\nterritory to the export terminal in Aqaba\nwith a capacity of 1 million barrels/day in\naddition to a branch to supply Jordan Oil\nRefinery with 150 thousand barrels/day. The\npipeline is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nThe continuation of the policy of liberalization\nof prices of petroleum products, and pricing\noil products on a monthly basis in accordance\nwith international oil prices. The pricing\npolicy is the most successful mechanism\nand technique to improve the efficiency of\nconsumption.\nThe Field of Natural Gas\nThe main policy: diversifying the natural gas\nresources.\nAfter the completion and construction of LNG\nterminal in Aqaba which went into commercial\noperation in September 2015, Jordan has the\nability to meet all the country’s needs for natural\ngas for electricity generation and for the industrial\nsector.\nCurrently, Jordan imports natural gas by three\nroutes: via the LNG terminal in Aqaba which\nwent into commercial operation in September\n2015, via the Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt and\nvia pipeline from the Noble Energy Company on\na take or pay basis.\nIn 2019, 86% of the electricity generation of the\nKingdom was based on natural gas imported via\nthe LNG terminal and Egyptian natural gas.\nThe natural gas needed for electricity generation\nduring the period 2016-2022 was estimated to\nbe 350-420 Million Metric Cubic Feet per Day\n(MMcfd). However in the period 2023-2025, the\nquantity will be decreased to 250-350 MMcfd, due\nto the operation of the oil shale power plants.\nThe demand of the industrial sector for natural\ngas is estimated to be 150 MMcfd in the same\nperiod of 2023-2025.\nIn addition, the National Petroleum Company\n(NPC) plans to develop the Risha gas field, in\nJordan, to increase natural gas production\nfrom the site, to 50 MMcfd as a 1st stage. NPC\nhas announced the Risha field as an investment\nopportunity, and is aiming to attract a strategic\npartner for this project.\nIn regard to utilizing waste to generate electricity,\nthe following two projects will be considered:\n- A power plant will be built, which will operate\non direct burning of solid waste, with a\ncapacity of (50 MW) in the Central Area of\nthe Kingdom.\n- A bio–gas power plant will be built, with a\ncapacity of (25 MW), in Ghabawi area, East of\nAmman, , to be operational, in 2022.\nThe Field of Renewable Energy\nThe main policy: utilizing the renewable energy\nresources to generate electricity.\nIn light of the large progress in utilizing the\nrenewable energy resources to generate electricity,\nthe total capacity of the constructed, under\nconstruction and committed projects during the\nperiod 2020-2023 will reach 2400 MW as illustrated\nearlier. Considering the NEPCO situation, the total\nnew capacity of wind and solar energy to be added\nto the system during the period 2024-2030 will be\n600 MW of which 400 MW will be wheeling and\nnet metering systems.\nThe Field of Oil Shale\nThe main policy: utilizing the oil shale resources\nto generate electricity and produce oil.\n\n71\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n Oil shale projects for electricity generation\nDue to the over-committed generating capacity\nin terms of MW, the second direct burning of oil\nshale project for electricity generation will be\nconsidered in the year 2028.\n Oil shale projects for extraction of oil shale\nAll oil shale companies were asked to postpone\nthe development period, and some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed their businesses. Oil shale\ncompanies that asked for development period\nextension were Jordan Oil Shale Company (JOSCO)\nwhich was intending to produce 20,000 barrels of\noil shale in 2025, Jordan Oil Shale Energy Company\n(JOSE) intending to produce 20,000 barrels/day\nin 2025, Karak International Oil Company (KIO)\nintending to produce 25,000 barrels/day in 2024,\nand Saudi Arabian Corp for Oil Shale (SACOS)\nintending to produce 20,000 barrels/day in 2025.\nThe Field of Nuclear Energy\nConsidering the over committed generating\ncapacity in terms of MW, in the national electric\nsystem, introducing nuclear energy as an\nalternative for electricity generation will be\nconsidered after the year 2030. The Atomic Energy\nCommission is conducting a study to find the best\ntechnology to construct small nuclear reactors in\nseveral locations in Jordan territory, from two to\nsix units with a capacity of 110 MW for each unit.\n3.2.2 Baseline scenario for the transport sector\nA. Sector Policies and Strategies\nA.1 Strategies, policies and plans at the national\nlevel\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No. 89, 2003. Jordan’s Long Term\nNational Transport Strategy and Action Plan set\nout the sector policies and strategies. Key policies\ninclude:\n\nImplementing a multi modal approach to\ninclude rail, with good interconnections\nbetween modes, networks and transport\nservices.\n\nProtecting the environment, by increasing\nthe modal share of low-carbon transport\nmodes, and improving energy efficiency by\npromoting innovative technologies.\n\nProviding a greater degree of accessibility,\nparticularly where current provision of public\ntransport services are poor or inadequate.\nBased on these main policies a number of strategies\nwere developed to achieve the goals set out for\nthe sector. These strategies were adapted to form\nfive alternative scenarios. These were prioritized by\nincorporating Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) results\ninto a Multi-Criteria Analysis framework, which\nconsidered impacts of the scenarios over the six\ncriteria: regional, technical, social, policy, economic\nand financial and environmental.\nThe chosen scenario was the scenario termed\nthe “Environmental Option”. This scenario was\nbuilt (within the strategy) selecting measures\naimed at reducing the impacts of the transport\nsector on the environment (i.e. emissions, effects\nof climate change, noise and land use). In the\n‘Environmental’ Scenario public transport was\ngiven a high priority, with strategies aimed\nat shifting modal shares from private to mass\ntransit. These included improvement of networks,\nincluding the implementation of the Hejaz railway\nalong its entire route from Aqaba to the Syrian\nborder and also setting minimum safety and\nquality standards for public transport vehicles.\nConcerning the road sector, the included strategies\nplaced higher importance on maintenance and\nsafety-enhancing measures for the existing\nnetwork, rather than extensive road-building.\nFurther strategies concerned minimum safety\nand emissions standards for freight vehicles.\nNational Climate Change Policy\nOne of the key national policies that tackled the\nTransport sector was the National Climate Change\nPolicy for Jordan 2013-2020. For the transport\nsector, the policy identified the following strategic\nclimate change objectives:\n\n72\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nTo integrate climate change mitigation\nobjectives and the impact of GHG emissions\ninto transport policies, strategies and action\nplans,\n\nTo promote use of energy efficient, low carbon\ntechnologies, and increase understanding of\ntheir mitigation impact,\n\nTo promote low carbon energy efficient\nmodes of transport.\nThe report also recommended measures to\nachieve the afore-mentioned objectives:\n\nDeveloping\nand\nstrengthening\nlocal\ncapacities in assessment of different transport\nmodes and their mitigation effect,\n\nImproving data collection related to activity\ndata, emissions and emissions factors,\n\nDeveloping Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs).\nIntended Nationally Determined Contributions\n(INDCs)\nIn 2016, Jordan submitted its INDCs to the\nUNFCCC  with the objective of reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. This INDCs Action\nPlan was formally approved by Jordan in August\n2019. The INDCs include mitigation projects for\nthe transport sector including: implementing\na railway system, implementing the bus rapid\ntransit (BRT) nationally, provision of electric car\ncharging stations powered by renewable energy\nand ensuring the inclusion of energy efficiency\nconsiderations in purchase of vehicles. The aim of\nthese projects is to increase the total number of\ncommuters using public transport and reduce total\nvehicle kilometers travelled, fuel consumption,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants\n(More details can be found in Appendix B)\nHighway Master Plan\nThe Ministry of Public Works and Housing\n(MoPWH) carried out its Highway Master Plan\nStudy in 2011. This study provided a timephased road sector development plan up\nto 2030, recommending roads and bridges\nin need of recovery maintenance, including\nimplementation of identified safety measures,\nthe major task identified was the rehabilitation\nof the Desert Highway. Several highways were\nalso recommended for road widening to ease\ncongestion. The study suggested that the\nnetwork was sufficient, but recommended the\nimplementation of a ring road for Amman.\nA.2 Strategies, policies and plans at the subnational level (within GAM)\nAs for Amman city, GAM’s planning document is\nthe 2010 Transport Mobility Master Plan (TMMP),\nwhich has been designed to guide development\nof the transport system within GAM up to 2025.\nThe transport policies developed by GAM in the\nTMMP were based on providing a public Transport\n(PT) system which is accessible and affordable to\nall and encouraging a variety of mobility options\nwhile promoting public transport and walking.\nGAM strategies were developed related to public\ntransport, road safety, pedestrian environment,\nparking, freight, intelligent transport systems (ITS),\ndemand management and the road network.\nStrategies were also developed for the Downtown\nof Amman.\nIn the TMMP twelve scenarios were developed.\nThese scenarios were basically based on the level\nof public transport to be provided (regular bus,\nBRT, light rail) combined with a range of demand\nmanagement measures (soft, medium and\nhard). For GAM the preferred scenario included\nsubstantial investment in high quality public\ntransport services, i.e. bus rapid transit (BRT)\nand light rail, but combined with soft demand\nmanagement.\nTransport and mobility projects have also\nbeen developed within Amman in documents\nseeking to encourage the city’s development in a\nsustainable and environmentally friendly manner.\nThese include:\n\n73\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAmman Resilience Strategy\nThis was developed with the guidance of the\nRockefeller Institute’s 100 resilient cities. As well\nas projects for an integrated mobility plan, BRT\nand metro. The report developed the following\nprojects:\n\nDevelop an urban mobility observatory,\nto enable a data-driven decision-making\napproach,\n\nDevelop, review and update Amman’s street\nmanual to provide guidance to city planners\nto design safe, high standard streets that\nprovide universal and inclusive accessibility\nand promote a walkable environment,\n\nCreate a walking map to show routes between\nneighborhoods,\n\nExplore tactical urbanism opportunities\ni.e. creating opportunities for youth to\nparticipate in the redesign of spaces and\ntemporarily reclaim spaces designated to\ncars,\n\nOrganize a design competition for the area\naround Amman’s Hejaz Railway, to increase\naccess to green spaces in the city.\nAmman Climate Plan, a Vision for 2050\nThis vision document, which was developed\nwith the assistance of the World Bank, sets out a\nseries of projects for transport and mobility. These\ninclude expansion of several of GAM’s projects\nincluding more lanes of BRT, purchasing more\nelectric vehicles to replace vehicles owned by\nGAM and taxis and providing buses with improved\nfuel specifications. In addition, they recommend\nenhancing the efficiency of the city bus network,\nto be addressed as part of the Feeder project.\nAdditionally, the plan recommends the following\nprojects, many of which could be achieved in the\nshort term:\n\nImplementation of a public transportation\nawareness plan to change perceptions and\nbehavior,\n\nCoordination of transit-oriented planning\nwith the planning and transportation\ndepartments,\n\nInstallation of electric vehicle charging\nstations around the city,\n\nImplementation of benefits for zero/low\nemission vehicles, including fast lanes,\nparking discounts, and reduced fees,\n\nInstalling bike paths and other bike safety\nmeasures.\nThe vision document also recommends the\nimprovement of walkability through:\n\nInstallation of new sidewalks,\n\nMaintenance and improvement of existing\nsidewalks,\n\nIncreased green space and tree cover,\n\nIntroduction of pedestrian safety measures.\nGreen City Action Plan\nThis project was launched in 2017 between EBRD\nand GAM to promote sector reforms and develop\npriority projects to modernise infrastructure and\nmunicipal services in Amman.\nThe report is still under development, but it will\nrecommend projects based on the strategic\nobjectives of:\n\nIncreasing the modal share of public\ntransportation,\n\nDeveloping a public realm strategy that\nsupports\npedestrian\ntravel,\n\nIncorporating smart systems in transport\nplanning.\nB. Key Committed Projects\nAmman Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Amman\nZarqa BRT: In these projects, which are currently\nunder construction, buses will be operated in their\nown dedicated lanes. The two systems will be\noperated as one integrated system and will form\nan important backbone for transport in the area.\n\n74\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nThe Amman BRT project will be supported by a\nstudy, to be implemented by GAM, concerning\npublic transport in the area of the Amman BRT.\nThe aim of this study is to advise how to rearrange\nand supplement current public transport services\nin order to support and make ‘best use’ of the\nBRT, by providing ‘feeder’ services to provide\naccess from neighborhoods to BRT stations.\nPotential benefits of these combined projects\nare to improve the image of public transport and\nencourage a mode shift from private vehicles to\nBRT and public transport in general. This mode\nshift from private vehicles to public transport, is\nexpected to produce a reduction in congestion,\nfuel use and emissions of greenhouse gases and\nother pollutants.\n The fuel type of the buses to be purchased is\nstill under consideration. The minimum standard,\nwould be diesel Euro V or Euro VI, but electric\nbuses are still under consideration.\nThe reorganization of the current public transport\nsystem for Amman based on the Feeder Study is\nexpected to lead to a greater number of services\nbeing operated by new BRT buses. This would\nlead to a decrease in emissions, however is not\npossible to estimate the emissions savings until\nreorganization of public transport networks has\nbeen agreed.\nProposed Update of TMMP: A comprehensive\nlist of proposed projects is laid out in the TMMP\nto support the strategies identified by GAM for\ntransport in the city. However, it is considered\nthat the next step for GAM should be to carry\nout an update of the TMMP, since the previous\nstudy is now 10 years old and there have been\nconsiderable changes in the city, in particular a\nlarge growth in population. This would enable the\npolicies and strategies to be set out for mobility in\nGAM for the next 15 years, with the aim of guiding\nAmman city into development while considering\nenergy efficiency and sustainability. One of the\nexpected outcomes of the project is a roadmap\nfor future growth in mobility in GAM with clear\npriorities given to proposed projects.\nThe Data Warehouse Project: this project is\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, with the\npurpose of collecting, storing, processing and\ndistribution of data concerning the transport\nsector. This should motivate the use of data by\ndecision makers at all levels. Potential benefits\ninclude the use of trends analysis to make\nestimates for the future and use of previous\nexperience in future planning.\nPublic Transport Restructuring Project for\nGovernorates: Projects are planned to restructure\nthe urban public transport systems of Irbid, Zarqa\nand Madaba with the aim of developing reliable\npublic transport systems and improving the level\nof services for citizens. Potential benefits are to\npromote a mode shift to public transport trips,\nfrom private vehicle trips, with a subsequent\nreduction in congestion, fuel use and emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants.\nIntelligent Transport Systems Project (ITS): The\naim of this project is to develop and operate ITS\nto monitor and control public transport services,\nand to provide an integrated electronic payment\nsystem. This has been implemented in GAM as\na pilot project with the new buses for Amman\nVision introduced in 2019. Potential benefit is\nin adding convenience for passengers, helping\nto promote mode shift from private vehicles to\npublic transport.\nAmman, Salt and Irbid Ring Roads: Salt and\nIrbid ring roads are currently under construction.\nAmman ring road, Phase 1, also known as Amman\nDevelopment Corridor is already completed.\nFeasibility and Environmental Studies, as well as\ndetailed designs have been carried out for the\nremaining sections. Potential benefits of these\nprojects are to relieving traffic congestion in the\ncities, particularly from truck traffic and improve\naccess to areas on the outskirts of the city.\n\n75\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAirport Projects: Air travel connections to\nJordan are vital to Jordan’s economic growth.\nProjects have been proposed to accommodate\nin future increasing passenger numbers,\nthrough expansion at Amman Civil Airport and\nKing Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nImplementation of a further airport has also been\nsuggested. Potential benefits of these projects are\npredominantly economic, but are also important\nfor accessibility.\nProjects concerning freight: In order to\nevaluate the GHG mitigation effect of freight\nprojects, concerning use of different modes\nof transportation, emissions factors from the\ndifferent modes published by Department of the\nEnvironment, Fisheries & Rural Affairs (Defra), UK\nhave been compared. The lowest emissions from\nfreight transport are for cargo ship, followed by\nfreight rail services, and therefore these would\nbe the best options for freight to and within the\ncountry. Transporting freight by air, either within\nthe country or into the country has the largest\nemissions factors, and therefore road freight is\nto be preferred to air freight.\nASEZA Rail Freight Project: Feasibility and\ntechnical studies are being undertaken for the\ndevelopment of a railway connecting a planned\nland port at Ma’an with port facilities around\nAqaba. Potential benefits are to encourage mode\nshift for freight between Aqaba and Ma’an from\nroad to rail, leading to a reduction in congestion,\nand emissions of greenhouse gases and other\npollutants.\nMoT National Railway Project: The aim is to\nestablish a freight railway network. The railway\nbetween Aqaba and Ma’an forms the first part\nof this plan. The remainder of the project is still\nin need of funding. Potential benefits are to\nencourage mode shift for freight around the\ncountry and to/from neighboring countries from\ntrucks to railway with an expected reduction in\ncongestion and emissions from greenhouse gases\nand other pollutants.\nC. Future Trends in Transport Sector\nIn the short term (around 5 years) there are\nmany projects being implemented, which will\nhave a large effect on transport in Jordan. The\nBRT network for Amman and between Zarqa and\nAmman should be operational in 2021, with a\nmodern comfortable bus fleet. The reorganization\nand restructuring of public transport services in\nAmman, Zarqa, Irbid and Madaba, should also\nhave been carried out, with implementation of ITS\ntechnology on all buses. Additionally, walkability\nin Amman is already being improved, with the\nrehabilitation of areas along the BRT lines currently\nunder construction by GAM.\nThese projects and improvements are expected\nto encourage a mode shift in trips from private\nvehicles to public transport as it is made more\nconvenient and comfortable. This is expected to\nlead to a reduction in congestion and a decrease\nin fuel use, with a corresponding drop in emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants. These\nprojects may additionally be copied by other\ngovernorates and within Amman, where there is\npotential for further lines of BRT and improvements\nin walking infrastructure. The data warehouse\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, would be\na source of data and information concerning all\ntransport projects, which could be made available\nto interested organisations.\nThe MoPWH is expected to have completed\nnecessary rehabilitation of the Desert Highway,\nand carried out widening and rehabilitation of\nroads, as identified in the 2011 Highways Master\nPlan. This would lead to improved journey times\nand reduced congestion, which would lead\nto more efficient operations for road freight\ntransport.\nGAM’s TMMP Update Project should have been\ncompleted\nproviding\nimportant\nguidance\nconcerning the priority for projects in the transport\nsector within the city.\nIt is expected to have more electric cars on the\nroads of Amman, purchased by GAM and by the\npublic, as they are shown to be efficient for city-\n\n76\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nuse and as fuel stations and destinations in the\ncity provide more charging stations.\nIn the medium term (around 10 years) larger\ninfrastructure projects committed by the\nGovernment of Jordan should have been\nimplemented. These are expected to include the\npipeline project between Jordan and Iraq and the\nrailway project between Aqaba and Ma’an. These\ntwo projects would remove a large number of\ntruck vehicle kms from the network, since trips\nby oil trucks to Zarqa from Amman and Iraq, and\ntrips by freight lorries between Amman and Aqaba\nare expected to be largely replaced by trips by\npipeline or rail.\nWork on Amman Civil Airport and King Hussein\nInternational Airport, are expected to have been\ncompleted, allowing greater passenger trips and\nboosting tourist numbers and economic growth\nin the country.\nRing roads around Amman, Salt and Irbid should\nhave been completed, improving accessibility for\nareas around these cities and reducing congestion\nin the city centres. Stronger legislation will have\nbeen possible for trucks to keep them out of the\nurban areas of these cities, now suitable alternative\nroutes have been provided, reducing congestion,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants.\nKey projects for the longer term include the\nNational Rail Network, which would connect with\nthe railway from Aqaba at Ma’an. This is expected\nto carry a large proportion of the freight across\nJordan, which would provide savings in terms of\nreducing Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) on the\nroad network, with a reduction in congestion, fuel\nuse, GHG emissions and other pollutants. Metro\nfor Amman could also have been implemented.\nAdditionally, it is expected to have projects for\nGAM, as prioritized through the TMMP Update\nproject. Potentially these could include a tram for\nDowntown Amman, and light rail from Amman\nto Queen Alia International Airport.\n3.2.3 Baseline scenario for the industrial\nprocess sector\nIndustry is a significant contributor to Jordan’s\nGDP, directly contributing about 24% to the\nnational Gross Domestic Product (GDP), during\n2017.\nIndustry in Jordan is divided into two main types;\nmanufacturing sector, including the production\nof cement, lime, fertilizers and chemicals, and the\nmining and quarrying sector, including quarrying\nof limestone.\nJordan’s industrial sector is increasingly affected by\nregional circumstances; exports to Iraq and Syria\ndecreased because of the increasing difficulties of\ntransportation and trade across the north-eastern\nand northern borders and the land routes to the\nMediterranean. Moreover, the industrial sector is\nfacing new challenges due to COVID-19 pandemic\nin 2020, i.e. Cement production has decreased due\nto Lockdown, and particularly periods of curfew\nthat have slowed down operations significantly.\nThe government has focused on developing\nthe industrial sector, through attracting foreign\ninvestment, privatization of public establishments\nand providing customs and tax exemptions\nfor investment projects within the different\nsectors, particularly the mining sector. However,\nGovernment policies should take into account the\nafore-mentioned industry circumstances.\nThere are laws and regulations that encourage\nand protect the capital investment such as Jordan\nInvestment Law No. 30 of 2014. However, current\nJordanian laws and regulations do not directly\ncontrol CO2 and other GHG emissions from\nindustrial processes. For example, the Jordanian\nlegally binding standards (JS 1189/2006)\nconcerning the quantity and quality of emissions\nfrom stationary sources such as the industrial\nprocesses has no specific threshold value for CO2\nand GHG emissions.\nThe following are the governmental policies,\nstrategies and plans relevant to the industrial\nsector:\n\n77\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe Ministry of Industry Trade and Supply\ndeveloped an industrial policy (2017 – 2021)\nto enhance the competitiveness of the\nindustrial sector, increase its contribution to\neconomic development, enable it to increase\nits exports to traditional and new markets,\nand increase the investment through an\neffective partnership with the private sector,\n\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021)\nincludes the establishment of a fund to\nsupport and finance industrial development\nin order to finance projects resulting from the\nindustrial policy, reduce the operational costs\non the industrial sector through motivating\nthe use of alternative energy sources,\nproviding technical and financial support\nto industrial companies, and developing\ninfrastructure and regulatory procedures for\nthe transport sector in all modes serving the\nindustrial activities,\n\nThe National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020)\nsingled out a major thrust for the state of\nproduction which includes a number of\nnational priorities and projects related to the\nindustry and commerce sectors and small\nand medium enterprises. These priorities and\nprojects aim to increase productivity, increase\ngrowth in Jordan’s economy and generate\ndecent job opportunities for Jordanians,\n\nBylaw No. 13/2020 includes a set of standards\nand criteria that must be achieved for the\nindustrial sector, including supporting the\ndevelopment of this sector, increasing its\ncompetitiveness in foreign markets and\nproviding job opportunities for Jordanians.\nListed below are the main plans/activities of\nthe government to improve the industrial\nperformance of Jordan:\n\nEnhance the competitiveness of the industrial\nsector and increase its export potential to\ntraditional and new markets,\n\nImproving the quality of local products and\nadapting them to international specifications.\n\nProviding job opportunities for all Jordanians,\nincluding female workers and people with\ndisabilities,\n\nIncrease confidence in the industrial sector\nand support the development of this sector\nto effectively contribute to economic\ndevelopment of the country,\n\nAllow the lease of treasury lands in the\ngovernorates for the purpose of establishing\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by the\ngovernorates citizens, according to specific\ncontrols and standards,\n\nReduce the operational costs of the\nindustrial sector through motivating the\nuse of alternative energy sources, providing\ntechnical and financial support to industrial\ncompanies, and developing infrastructure\nand regulatory procedures for the transport\nsector for all modes serving industrial\nactivities,\n\nImprove the investment environment, in\norder to attract foreign investments to all\nthe governorates,\n\nImprove the required infrastructure of\nservices needed for industrial activities,\n\nReduce the gap between the output of\neducation and vocational training and the\nneeds of the labor market and provide the\nnecessary support, in order to build the\ncapacities of workers in the industrial sector,\n\nEnhance the communication between\ntechnical research and development entities\nand industries in order to improve knowledge\nconcerning\nuse\nof\nnew\ntechniques/\ntechnologies,\n\nEnhance the adoption of Best Available\nTechnology (BAT) and Best Environmental\nPractices (BEP) in the industrial processes,\n\nImprove regulations and policies in order to\nencourage industrial investment,\n\nEnhance cooperation between the private\nand public sectors,\n\n78\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nEstablish a national strategy to improve the\nexport of local products to the international\nmarket,\n\nImprove the financial support mechanism\nto incentivise industrial investments,\n\nProvide technical support to the industries\nin order to comply with technical and\nenvironmental standards and enhance\ntheir participation in setting standards and\ndecision-making.\n3.2.4 Baseline scenario for the waste sector\nJordan is shifting towards more sustainable\nsolid waste management systems and trying to\nintroduce more innovative options to tackle the\nchallenge of solid waste management, especially\nwith the high pressure exerted on its system with\nthe flux of refugees as a result of the Syrian crisis\nin recent years. Efforts made by the Ministry of\nEnvironment resulted in the adoption of The Solid\nWaste Framework Law, which aims at producing\ngood governance in the waste sector. The Ministry\nof Local Administration also adopted the National\nStrategy in 2015, which diagnoses most of the\nproblems the waste management system suffers\nfrom. Some of the problems and weaknesses\nidentified by the strategy are: low operational\nefficiency of municipalities and Joint Services\nCouncils, lack of information, low sanitation level\nat landfills (except Ghabawi), low level of recycling,\nfew projects for waste to energy and composting\nactivities.\nThe new solid waste management framework\nlaw which came into force in September 2020\nwill organise the solid waste sector in Jordan for\nthe coming years and will provide the basis for\nbetter solid waste management.\nThe per capita solid waste generation rate is\ncurrently around 1kg/capita/day for urban areas\nin Jordan and is expected to continue increasing\nin the coming years with urbanization, reduction\nof family size and with increase in income. Waste\nin rural areas will mostly continue to increase but\nat a higher rate than in urban areas.\nFunds from international agencies contributed\nto upgrading the solid waste infrastructure. The\nupgrade in solid waste infrastructure such as\nintroduction of more solid waste transfer stations\nwill improve the system capacity and will also\nimprove the financial situation of municipalities\nespecially medium and large ones.\nAlso,\nsome\ndonors\nhave\nstarted\nwaste\nmanagement programs such as waste sorting\nfacilities and composting at some landfills and\nwithin refugees camps. The unstable recyclables\nmarket still hinders the sustainability of the waste\nreduction and recycling programs as they still do\nnot meet their monetary- economic feasibility.\nComposting will continue to be unfeasible unless\nit is adopted as governmental policy for waste\nreduction.\nPrivate Public Partnership (PPP) in solid waste\nactivities in Jordan is still weak and needs to be\nimproved even though there are some good\nexamples in Aqaba, Zarqa, and Petra. Awareness\nof public and vocational training of solid waste\nworkers still needs to be improved more with\nfocus on introducing key performance indicators\nfor waste collection systems and workers at\nmunicipality level. Improvements expected in\nsolid waste management will not be sustainable\nunless an information management system is\nadopted at all levels.\nThe economic success along with good\ngovernance in solid waste management are the\nmost important. It is also important to achieve\ndecoupling between GDP and waste generation\nwhich is not an easy task. Success in decoupling\nis ensured by effective awareness raising, waste\nreduction programs, waste recycling and reuse\nand application of resource efficiency and cleaner\nproduction principles in industry.\nClimate change is expected to impact both waste\ngeneration rate and waste decomposition rate.\nReduced cloud cover, as one of the climate change\nfeatures, adversely impacts the life of exposed\nmaterial resulting in more waste generation.\nIn general, the rate of population growth in Jordan\nhas been declining since the 1950’s except during\n\n79\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nexceptional circumstances, such as the Gulf War,\nwhere population increased by 10.3% and 6.72% in\n1990 and 1991 respectively. The strategy suggests\nthat the decrease in population growth rate will\ncontinue and may reach around 1.26 % in 2040.\nIn reality, the growth rate will not continue to\ndecrease, but would reach a fixed value of around\n2.1% as the growth rate of population is greatly\naffected by religious belief, social circumstances\nand economic situation. As such, the solid waste\nquantities generated will continue to increase, but\nwith a lower rate if only dependent on population\nincrease, and disregarding other factors. This is in\nline with the assumption of the national strategy\nthat assumes a 2.04% increase rate for urban areas\nand 1.02 % increase rate for rural areas. According\nto the strategy, by 2039 solid waste from urban\nareas will reach 1.64 and from rural areas 1.112\nkg/capita/day.\nHowever, in reality the waste generated per\ncapita is not expected to continue increasing\nand it should reach some stagnant point (noting\nthat Jordan is an upper middle income country\naccording to World Bank classification and is not\nexpected to become a high income country in\nthe foreseeable future).\nWaste composition is an important aspect for\nsuccessful environmental policies and good\nwaste management programs. Many solid waste\ncomposition studies have been performed\nin Jordan at different levels, most of them to\nanalyse waste received at landfills and others\nbased on samples at initial disposal points. It can\nbe concluded from all the studies that organic\nwaste seems to be the main component of the\nmunicipal solid waste, in addition to packaging\nwaste, which seems to be significant mostly in\nurban areas. Waste composition is not fixed and\ncould be changed based on different limiting\nfactors such as socioeconomic conditions,\nurbanization, etc. As Jordan accepts waves of\nrefugees from nearby countries, these incoming\npeople may have different social behaviors that\naffect waste composition at country level, but no\nspecific studies have been conducted to study\nthis impact. Also, unforeseen events affect waste\ncomposition, such as the current COVID 19 crisis\nwhich immediately resulted in an increase in\nplastic waste in the form of gloves and masks.\nBut this crisis may result in permanent changes in\nwaste composition such as increasing packaging\nwaste as a result of a change in social behavior,\nas people start ordering more online products.\nIn conclusion, waste quantities will continue to\nincrease with time in Jordan in the short and\nmedium term. To reach decoupling between\nwaste generation and economic growth, robust\npolicies need to be applied. Waste composition\nwill continue to change as the urbanization rate\nincreases, family size decreases, GDP increases and\nbased on other related factors.\n3.2.5 Baseline scenario for the AFOLU sector\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nis unique among all sectors, since its mitigation\npotential is based on both an enhancement of\nremovals of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as\nreduction of emissions through management\nof land and livestock. The AFOLU sector is\nresponsible for around a quarter of the annual\nGHG emissions resulting mainly from deforestation\nand agricultural emissions from livestock, soil\nand nutrient management. Opportunities for\nmitigation include both the supply-side and\ndemand side options as well as forests which are\nconsidered important carbon pools.\nPolicies governing practices in agriculture and\nin forest conservation and management need\nto account for both mitigation and adaptation.\nAnthropogenic\nland-use\nactivities\n(e.g.,\nmanagement of croplands, forests, grasslands,\nwetlands), and changes in land use/cover (e.g.,\nconversion of forest lands and grasslands to\ncropland and pasture, afforestation) cause\nchanges superimposed on natural carbon fluxes.\nLand is the critical resource for the AFOLU sector.\nIt provides food and fodder and it provides\nlivelihoods for people. Human economies and\nquality of life are directly dependent on the\nservices and the resources provided by land.\n\n80\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nIn Jordan, the natural ecosystems support human\nactivities in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,\ntourism, traditional and pharmaceutical health\nproducts, and traditional medicine, among others.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, less than\n5% of the country’s total area is arable land and\n90% is grazing land with 100-200 mm annual\nrainfall. Natural and human-made forests cover\naround 1% of the country’s area. The contribution\nof agriculture to the GDP in relative terms declined\nsharply from 40% in the 1950s to 4% in 2016.\nIrrespective of how humble the contribution of\nagriculture is to GDP and economic performance,\nfarming remains important. The importance of\nthe agricultural sector stems from the fact that\nit is not only a major source of food, particularly\ndairy products, fruits and vegetables, but it is also\na source of livelihood for 25% of the total poor\npopulation (livestock keepers, smallholder farm\nhouseholds, and landless former agriculturalists)\nliving in rural areas.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)\nstatistics 11% of the total country area is used\nas agriculture land and less than 1 % is forests\n(MoA, Annual Report, 2018). The country has three\ndistinguished bioclimatic zones namely:\n\nThe Jordan Valley, which forms a narrow strip\nthat is situated below the mean sea level with\nwarm winters and hot summers and where\nirrigation is practiced,\n\nThe western highlands, where annual\nprecipitation is in the range of 300 to 600\nmm,\n\nThe “Badia”, which includes the arid and semiarid areas in the eastern parts of the country,\nwhere the annual rainfall is below 200 mm.\nBadia is an Arabic word describing the open\nrangeland inhibited by Bedouins (nomads).\nAvailable governmental plans, programs, policies,\nand strategies announced and published by the\nMinistry of Agriculture, the Directorate of Forests,\nand other relevant institutions were reviewed.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture has just recently\npublished the 2020-2025 National Agricultural\nDevelopment Strategy focusing on the digitization\nand restructuring of the sector and boosting its\nproductivity.\nThe strategy identified a total of 174 interventions\nand projects that will be financed through a host\nof channels, including the Treasury; from the\nAgricultural Credit Corporation and from foreign\naid and grants.\nThe strategy has the following ambitious\nobjectives:\n\nIncreasing the agricultural GDP as a share\nof total GDP from 2.6 billion JD now to 3.66\nbillion JD by 2025 and boosting the addedvalue of agriculture to 2.48 billion JD from\n1.6 billion JD,\n\nIncreasing the forest area by 10% by 2025,\n\nExpanding pasture areas,\n\nCreating 65,000 jobs in the five-year period\nand replacing 21,000 foreign workers with\nJordanians,\n\nIncrease the number of farmers using digital\ngovernment-run agricultural services by 30\nper cent,\n\nReducing export costs to facilitate a 15 per\ncent increase in agricultural exports,\n\nIncrease the productivity of food and\nagricultural manufacturers by 18 per cent\nby 2025,\n\nThe utilization of modern technology to\nenhance production and productivity,\nfocusing on strategic crops,\nThe policy will address, as well, a number of\nchallenges facing the agricultural sector, among\nwhich:\n\nThe lack of comprehensive agricultural\ndatabases and poor utilization of modern\ntechnologies in agriculture that limited the\nagricultural producer’s access to retailers and\nconsumers,\n\n81\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nMarketing of products with the closure\nof neighboring markets due to regional\nconditions and the need to facilitate export\nof agricultural products through the Queen\nAlia International Airport (QAIA), \n\nLack of refrigerator trucks to transport fruit\nand vegetables ready for exporting,\n\nCompensating farmers for the damage to\ncrops because of frost,\n\nThe high cost of electricity for the agricultural\nsector,\n\nThe need to better manage the issue of nonJordanian workers in the sector, \n\nThe need to support livestock breeders with\nfeed, medicine and vaccines,\n\nIncrease in fodder prices due to delay and\ndecrease of rainfall.\nConsistent with these plans, the following is\nprojected as the baseline for AFOLU:\n\nField crops production: Increase productivity\nper unit area, promote water harvesting\ntechniques to expand planting areas, and\nmaintain productivity under predicted\ndecrease in rainfall,\n\nAnimal production: Promote high productive\nanimal species, under increase in prices of\nfodder, and other production inputs\n\nFodder\nproduction:\nReclamation\nof\nrangelands and control of overgrazing of\nrangelands, introduce species with high\nproductivity under drought conditions\nand promote wastewater reuse in fodder\nproduction,\n\nForestry conservation: Maintain forests which\nare threatened by predicted drought cycles,\nurban and rural expansion, expected fire\noccurrences, and illegal deforestation.\n3.3 Updates on the FBUR Mitigation Measures\nfor Different Sectors\nAccording to Annex III of Decision 2/CP.17 related to\nthe guidelines for the preparation of national BURs,\nnon-annex I parties should provide information,\nin a tabular format, on actions to mitigate climate\nchange, by addressing anthropogenic emissions\nby sources and removals by sinks of all GHGs not\ncontrolled by the Montreal Protocol.\nIn the preparation of this chapter of Jordan’s SBUR,\nall mitigation projects included in the FBUR have\nbeen reviewed and assessed to identify those\noptions considered to be still valid and applicable.\nThe cost-benefit analysis and the CO2 emissions\nreduction have been updated for each valid\nmitigation project. Net present value was used\nin the financial calculations, by converting all\npresent and future revenues and costs over the\nlifetime of the project to a base of today’s cost.\nThe same approach was followed in calculating\nCO2 emissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nproposed projects. A discount rate of 8% was used\nin all calculations of cost and emissions reduction.\nThe discounted unit cost of reduced emissions\nwhich is the quotient of the discounted cost to\nthe discounted emissions reduction was also\ncalculated.\nThe updated mitigation measures include GHG\nmitigation projects in the following areas:\n\nPrimary energy,\n\nRenewable energy,\n\nEnergy efficiency,\n\nIndustrial processes,\n\nWaste,\n\nAgriculture and forestry.\nThe results of the mitigation measures update is\npresented in the following sub-sections.\n3.3.1 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor primary energy\nThe GHG mitigation measures in the primary\nenergy demand and supply that were considered\nin the FBUR have been reviewed and assessed.\nAll information is presented in a tabular format\nin Appendix A, Table A.1. Table 3.4 is a summary\nof the FBUR mitigation projects and their current\nstatus.\n\n82\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.4: Status of the primary energy mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution Network\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nDemand Side Management\nCanceled from NEPCO’s implementation plan\nsince the different components of the project\nwill be implemented by JREEEF/MEMR through\nits Action Plan.\nAdding a 100 MW Combined Cycle in Samra\nPower Plant\nImplemented. It was modified to 70 MW instead\nof 100 MW and completely implemented by the\nyear 2018. According to the modification, the\ntotal estimated GHG emission reduction is 2066\nthousand tonnes CO2eq (kt CO2eq) during 25\nyears from 2018- 2043. The estimated emission\nreduction unit cost is - 33.77 JD/tonne of CO2eq.\nThus, the following two primary energy projects\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. The two mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution (T&D) Network, This project seeks\nto reduce the transmission and distribution\nlosses to 9% in 2027 compared to 13.3% in\n2020. The project will be executed gradually\nover a period of 6 years starting in 2022.\nThe main components of the project will\nbe optimizing the utilization of distributed\ngeneration, improving the system power\nfactor, upgrading or replacing existing\nconductors and insulators with lowerresistance equipment. The cost is estimated\nto be 48 Million USD. This project can lead to a\nsignificant reduction in fuel consumption and\nas a result a discounted emission reduction\nof 1,956 thousand tonnes of CO2 through the\n25 years, lifetime of the project (2022-2047),\n\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa, and Aqaba, According to the energy\nstrategy 2020-2030, Jordan will enhance\nthe usage of natural gas in all sectors such\nas Industrial, Residential, Commercial and\nTransportation. This includes the use of natural\ngas instead of liquefied petroleum gas for\ncooking, diesel in central heating and water\nheating and gasoline for cars. In 2020, 86%\nof the electricity generation of the Kingdom\nis generated from imported natural gas. To\ndeliver natural gas to smaller customers it will\nbe necessary to construct new low-pressure\ngas distribution networks to connect\ncustomers to the new infrastructure.\n The project will be executed gradually over\n10 years, starting in 2025 and with a capital\ncost of 110 million USD.\n Natural gas combustion emits 1.3 times less\nCO2 than that of oil, which indicates that\nusing natural gas in demand side sector as an\nalternative for diesel, fuel oil, LPG and gasoline,\nwill mitigate a significant quantity of CO2\nemissions. Using the natural gas distribution\nnetworks in the main cities of Amman, Zarqa,\nand Aqaba will mitigate about 2,708 thousand\ntonnes of CO2eq discounted emissions in the\n25 years of the project lifetime (2025-2050).\n The costs and CO2 emissions reduction for the\ntwo valid projects have been analyzed. Table\n3.5 shows a summary of the results.\n\n83\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.5: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne CO2eq) for the\nprimary energy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emission reductions\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission\nand Distribution Network\n1,956\n- 108.52\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\n2,708\n-13.78\n3.3.2 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor renewable energy (RE)\nRenewable energy (RE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed. All information is presented\nin a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.2. Table\n3.6 is a summary of their current status.\nTable 3.6: Status of RE mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\nSolar Water Heaters 2-30,000 Houses\nImplemented in four stages by JREEEF/MEMR during\nthe period 2017-2020.\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. Postponed to\nstart in the year 2022 instead of 2020.\n120 MW PV – Wheeling and Net Metering\nImplemented by MEMR during the period 2017-2020.\nThus, the following three renewable energy\nprojects are still valid and moved from FBUR to\nbe updated and considered in this SBUR. The three\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nConcentrating solar power (CSP) systems\nwork by concentrating the sun’s rays using\nmirrors to create heat, then the created heat\nis transferred to a heat transfer fluid. Electricity\nis then generated in a steam cycle, using the\nheat transfer fluid to create steam and generate\nelectricity as in conventional thermal power\nplants.\nConcentrated solar plants today typically include\nlow-cost thermal storage systems to decouple\ngeneration from the sun. Most commonly, a twotank molten salt storage system is used. CSP\nsystems are classified into line concentrating\nand focal concentrating systems referring to\nthe arrangements of concentrating mirrors.\nThe most widely deployed linear concentrating\nsystems are parabolic trough collectors while\nsolar towers are the most widely deployed focal\n\n84\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nconcentrating systems. It is expected that the\nconcentrated technology will play a major role\nin producing electricity with an increasing use\nof thermal storage to utilize excess heat during\nnight time to ensure the continuity of power\nproduction.\nThe capital cost of CSP represented by the\nunit cost of kW is decreasing with time. The\nreported global weighted- average cost of\nCSP commissioned in 2019 was USD 5,774/\nkW which is 36% lower than in 2010. Also,\nthe capacity factor increased to reach 45% in\n2019 with storage capacities from 4 to 8 hours.\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) costs that\ninclude insurance, and receivers and mirrors\nreplacements are substantial compared to solar\nPV and onshore wind energy but these costs\nare also declining with time. The typical costs\nof O&M of plants in operation today are in the\nrange of USD 0.02/kWh to USD 0.04/kWh (REVE\nmagazine, 2020).\nThe proposed capacity of this project will be\n100 MW and its capital cost, O&M costs, and\ncapacity factor are assumed to be the same as\nthose reported in 2019. The estimated annual\nelectricity production is around 394,200,000\nkWh and the capital cost is around 410 million\nJD. The estimated total discounted emission\nreduction is 1929.37 thousand tonnes CO2eq\nduring the 25 years of the project lifetime (20232047).\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nThis project is expected to be constructed in\n2028. In 2028, it is expected that the capital cost\nof CSP technology will decline by time and will\nreach 4,000 USD/kW while capacity factor will\nincrease to reach 70%. O&M cost is assumed\nto decrease to 0.01 USD/kW. The proposed\ncapacity of this project will be 300 MW with\nan estimated annual electricity production of\naround 1,708,200,000 kWh and a capital cost\nof around million JD 840. The estimated total\ndiscounted emission reduction is 9,003.71\nthousand tonnes CO2eq during the 25 years of\nthe project lifetime (2028-2052).\nSolar Water Heaters 3 – 30,000 houses\nThis mitigation project is similar to the previous\nsolar water heaters (SWH) projects which were\nproposed earlier in TNC and FBUR and were\nsuccessfully implemented by JREEEF/MEMR\nthroughout 2017-2020. This proposed project\nis planned to be implemented over three years\n2022- 2025 with a lifetime of 25 years 2022-2046.\nSWH saves electric energy used to heat water\nfor domestic use. It is assumed that SWH will\nreplace electric heaters and every house requires\na solar water heater of 4.6 m2 and every m2 can\nproduce around 740 kWh/yr. This proposed\nproject includes the installation of 30,000 solar\nwater heaters; the cost of each is 500 JD. The\ninstalled capacity of this project will be 54 MW\nwith an estimated annual electricity reduction of\naround 102 GWh. The estimated total discounted\nemission reduction is 457.53 thousand tonnes\nCO2eq during the 25 years of the project lifetime\n(2022-2046).\nThe cost and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nthree valid renewable energy projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.7.\nTable 3.7: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for renewable\nenergy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions reduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n1,929.37\n118.68\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n9,003.71\n- 7.18\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\n457.51\n-189.95\n\n85\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.3 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor energy efficiency (EE)\nEnergy Efficiency (EE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed. All information is presented\nin a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.3. Table\n3.8 is a summary of their current status.\nTable 3.8: Status of the energy efficiency (EE) mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nReplacing high thermal mass with low\nthermal mass (LTM) in ceramic factories\nNot valid. This project was originally proposed to be\nimplemented in 5 Ceramic companies, however, the\nmain Ceramic company in Zarqa and most of other\nceramic industries closed due to high competition of\nimported Ceramic especially from Egypt.\nReturning un-returned condensate to the\nfeed water tanks in food industry\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nInsulating the un-insulated pipes, fittings\nand tanks in food industries\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nReplacing fluorescent lamp fixtures with\nLED lamp fixtures in commercial buildings\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nduring the period 2017-2020.\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 new\nhouses\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nStreet lighting: replacing 125 W Mercury\nlamps with 70 W high pressure Sodium\nlamps\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nsuch as GAM during the period 2017-2020.\nUsing regenerative burners instead of\nconventional burners in Steel Reheating\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nUsing variable speed drives in the paper\nfactories pumps\nNot valid. This project was originally proposed to be\nimplemented in paper factories that produce paper\npulp, however, most of these factories are currently\nclosed and ready paper pulp is imported for further\nprocessing.\nLED lighting in public buildings\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nduring the period 2017-2020.\nImproving energy efficiency in small and\nmedium size hotels\nUnder implementation by JREEEF/MEMR as planned,\nduring the period 2017-2020, 16 small and medium\nhotels participated in this program\nLED lighting in households\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nduring the period 2017-2020.\nThus, the following four energy efficiency projects\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. The four mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed\nwater tanks in food industry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, condensate resulting from the\n\n86\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\ncondensation of steam is drained without the\nutilization of its heat. Therefore, returning this\ncondensate to the boiler feed water tank will\nsave energy represented by the saved heavy\nfuel oil to operate the boiler in addition to\nsaving in the cost of water treatment and\nwater itself. It is assumed that 10 food factories\nwill implement this energy efficiency measure\nwith a discounted emission reduction of\n7,433.38 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fitting and tanks\nin food industries.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, the steam and condensate\npipes and valves, and feed water tank are\nuninsulated. Insulating them will save energy\nin the form of saved fuel used to power the\nsteam boiler. It is assumed that 10 food\nfactories will implement this energy efficiency\nmeasure with a discounted emission reduction\nof 8,243.32 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 new houses.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented in\nthree years starting from 2022 with a lifetime\nof 30 years. It is assumed that 80% of new\nresidential houses are not insulated, so out\nof 3,500 checked houses it is assumed that\nthe insulation of walls and roofs will have\nbeen implemented for 2,800 houses. It is also\nassumed that the saving from this measure is\nabout 50% of the annual heating and cooling\nbills in these houses. It is estimated that this\nenergy efficiency measure will result in a\ndiscounted emission reduction of 69,792.85\ntonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the project\n(2022-2051).\n\nUsing Regenerative Burners Instead of\nConventional Burners in Steel Reheating\nIndustry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 20 years. In steel\nfactories, the reheating furnace uses heavy\nfuel oil to reheat the steel billets, usually to\nform the steel into construction steel rods.\nHigh speed pressure jet burners are used\nfor this purpose. Using regenerative burners\ninstead of these conventional burners will\nresult in energy saving of around 10%. It is\nestimated that implementing this energy\nefficiency measure in 5 steel factories will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n72,093.67 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2041).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed EE projects have been analyzed. A\nsummary of the results is shown in Table 3.9.\nTable 3.9: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nenergy efficiency mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions\nreduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water\ntanks in food industries\n7.43\n-108.04\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fittings, and tanks in\nfood industries\n8.24\n-215.16\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3500 new houses\n69.79\n-183.64\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional\nburners in steel reheating industries\n72.09\n-110.03\n\n87\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.4 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures for IPPU sector\nGHG mitigation options in the IPPU sector that were considered in the FBUR report have been reviewed\nand assessed. Relevant information is presented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.4. Table 3.10\nis a summary of their status.\nTable 3.10: Status of the IPPU mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the\nraw materials needed to produce clinker\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\ncement\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nof Pozzolana\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nUse of biomass (MSW or/and Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the nitric acid plant\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for IPPU\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. These mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute\nthe raw materials needed to produce clinker\nat the selected cement plant\nCertain steel slag and fly ash materials (decarbonated kiln feedstock) could be added to the\nraw material feed to reduce the amount of raw\nmaterial needed to produce a given amount of\nclinker. Jordan has more than 5 steel melting and\ngalvanizing factories, therefore there is an available\nstock of steel slag and fly ash to be used in the\ncement industry.\nIn this mitigation project, it is suggested to produce\na new type of cement CEM V (Composite Cement)\nat one of the cement industries; mainly the one that\nhas a neighboring steel manufacturing company\nand can try the production of this type of cement\nwith minor additional costs in comparison to\nother existing companies. The percentages of\nblast-furnace slag and natural Pozzolana range\nbetween 31-49% each, to produce CEM V/B. A\n40% substitution of steel slag/fly ash and a 10%\nproduction of new CEM V/B will be assumed at\nthis company.\nThe price of steel slag and/or fly ash is estimated\nto be 42.3 JD/tonne. The cost of energy and raw\nmaterials reach 61% of total cost and based on\nthe assumption of a production cost of 89.7 JD/\ntonne of cement. This option will reduce the cost\nby 54.7 JD/tonne of cement. No annual increase\nin the production costs will be assumed for the\nproject lifetime. Investment cost to grind the steel\nslag will be estimated as 2,442,928 JD (based on\nthe maximum produced tonnes of CEM II in 2046)\nbased on the estimated cost of 1.37 USD/tonne\ncement.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 250,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022 - 2046)\n\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in\n\nCEM II\nBlended cement is a mixture of clinker and additives\ncontaining less than 95% clinker. Blended cement\ntypes are distinct products with different uses\nthat have different additives and different shares\nof clinker. More than 90% of cement produced at\nthe local cement companies is CEM II (Portland–\nPozzolana Cement) with a percentage of Pozzolana\n\n88\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nranges between 21-32%. Therefore; there is an area\nto increase the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\nby improving the reactivity of the produced clinker\nand the raw mix to produce CEM II/B-P to achieve\nthe required strength of 42.5N that cause the use\nof Pozzolana of less than 32% (the 3% is substituted\nby gypsum). A reasonable 2% more substitution\ncould be assumed on average and so a reduction\nof CO2 emissions by 2% could be assumed as well.\nSince all local cement companies produce CEM\nII, there is no need for investment to procure the\nequipment needed to receive, store, grind and\nmeter.\nPozzolana to the cement product. The operational\ncost includes the price of extraction of Pozzolana,\npaid to MEMR (previously payment was to the\nNatural Resources Authority) and transportation.\nHowever, this option will reduce the cost of raw\nmaterials (mainly limestone) and energy needed to\nproduce the saved clinker that will be substituted\nby Pozzolana.\nThe price of Pozzolana is estimated to be 36.6 JD/\ntonne. As mentioned above, this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement to save both\nenergy and raw materials and no extra investment\ncost is needed.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, it is\nexpected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is assumed\nto be 25 years.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 367,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022-2046)\n\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with\n45% of Pozzolana\nIt is estimated that 10% of currently produced CEM\nII/B-P will be changed to CEM IV, strength 22.5X in\nwhich the Pozzolana substitution will reach 45% (at\nleast 13% more (starting from approximately 32%).\nCO2 reduction will be calculated by multiplying the\nannual CO2 emissions by the reduced percentage of\n13%, this percentage will also be multiplied by the\npercentage of the products that will be converted\nfrom CEM II/B-P to CEM IV which is assumed to be\n10% of CEM II/B-P. Therefore; annual CO2 emissions\nfrom producing CEM II/B-P will be multiplied by\n1.3% to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction as\na result of implementing this option.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, marketing\nthe new product, and setting the legally binding\nregulations and enforcement measures to control\nits use, it is expected to start the implementation of\nthis project in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\nto be 25 years. The price of Pozzolana is estimated\nto be 36.6 JD/tonne and also this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement by savings in\nboth energy and raw materials, and with no extra\ninvestment. It is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 238,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nUse of biomass (MSW and/or Sewage Sludge)\nas alternative fuels\nA potential reduction of CO2 emissions in the\ncement industry could be achieved by switching\nfrom traditional fossil fuel to a biomass fuel.\nSince most local cement factories are licensed\nto burn coal, petcoke, oil shale and alternative\nfuels such as waste tires and used oil, to replace\nthe expensive heavy fuel oil, they are equipped\nwith multi-purpose burners which reduce the\ninvestment costs for using biomass as alternative\nfuels. However, the required capital cost depends\non the needed storage, segregation, handling,\ngrinding and metering as well as environmental\npollution control measures. A value of 27.5 JOD/\ntonne of alternative fuel is used to estimate the\ninvestment cost based on the maximum estimated\ntonnes needed in 2046. So, the investment cost for\nthis option is estimated at 129,942,957 JD.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, studies\nof the maximum percentage of MSW and dried\nsewage sludge to be used, availability of stocks\nin the market, testing the emissions, conduct EIA\nstudy and getting the environmental clearance;\nit is expected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\n\n89\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nto be 25 years. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 814,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the Nitric Acid plant\nThis project involves the installation of a new N2O\nabatement technology that is not commonly used\nin nitric acid plants. The abatement technology is\na pelleted catalyst that will be installed inside the\nammonia burner just underneath the precious\nmetal gauzes. This technology is capable of\nreducing approximately 75% to 80% of the N2O\nformed at the precious metal gauzes inside\nthe ammonia burner to atmospheric N2 and O2\n(through communication with KEMAPCO).\nThe selected N2O abatement technology depends\non replacing some of the Al2O3 balls that support\nthe platinum-rhodium catalyst by a base metal\nsecondary catalyst, which is capable of reducing\nN2O by at least 75%.\nThis project will only be implemented for the sake\nof GHG emissions reduction; there are no other\ndirect benefits. Therefore, its implementation is\nstrongly dependent on the provision of economic\nincentives. The project is assumed to start in 2022\nand its lifetime is estimated to be the same as the\nlifetime of the KEMAPCO plant, which is estimated\nto be 25 years (till the year 2046). It is estimated\nthat implementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n1,659,000 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2046).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed IPPU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.11.\nTable 3.11: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nIPPU mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost\n(JD/tonne of\nCO2eq)\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw\nmaterials needed to produce clinker\n250\n-22.9\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II cement\n367\n-32.1\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nPozzolana\n238\n-32.0\nUse of biomass (MSW and/ or Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\n814\n-69.3\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia burner\nof the nitric acid plant\n1,659\n0.37\n3.3.5 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor AFOLU sector\nThe main mitigation options within AFOLU mainly\ninvolve one or more of three strategies:\n\nReduction/prevention of emissions to the\natmosphere by conserving existing carbon\npools in soils or vegetation that would\notherwise be lost, or by reducing emissions\nof CH4 and N2O,\n\nSequestration—enhancing the uptake of\ncarbon in terrestrial reservoirs, and thereby\nremoving CO2 from the atmosphere,\n\n90\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nReducing CO2 emissions by introducing\nchanges within demand-side options (e.g., by\nlifestyle changes, reducing losses and waste\nof food, changes in human diet, changes in\nwood consumption).\nGHG mitigation options in the AFOLU sector that\nwere considered in the FBUR report have been\nreviewed and updated. Relevant information is\npresented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table\nA.5. Table 3.12 is a summary of their status.\nTable 3.12: Status of the AFOLU mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in urban areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in northern area\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 1- Restoration of rangeland areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 2- New protected rangeland area as\nnatural reserve\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nPromoting for climate-smart agricultural practices in\nthe Jordan Valley\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for\nAFOLU are still valid. The projects will be modified\nand updated to be considered in this SBUR. These\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n\nIntroduce new trees plantation in Urban Areas\nLosses in urban trees are a continuous concern\neither due to snow storms, or from burning, and\ncutting due to land use change. No official numbers\nhave been published, but it was assumed that an\naverage loss of around 2,500 trees within Greater\nAmman Municipality area will be compensated\nfor, mostly by planting pine and coniferous trees.\nA medium growth coniferous tree, planted in an\nurban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years,\nsequesters 0.060-tonnes CO2 per planted tree. It\nis estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 1,502 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of\nthe project (2022 – 2042).\n\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in\nNorthern\nArea\nLosses in forest trees are a continuous concern,\neither due to snow storms, burning or illegal cutting.\nNo official numbers have been published regarding\nthe loss, but it was assumed that an average loss\nof around 30,000 trees within the Northern Area\nwill be compensated for, mostly by planting pine\nand coniferous trees. A medium growth coniferous\ntree, planted in an urban setting and allowed to\ngrow for 10 years, sequesters 0.060-tonne CO2 per\nplanted tree. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 11,923 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2042).\n\nRangeland restoration and increase in forage\nproduction Projects\nThe projects suggest that the Ministry of Agriculture\nestablish a public corporation responsible for\nforage production and sales to livestock owners.\nThe corporation will be responsible for buying the\nplants and for hiring labor for cultivation.\nTwo areas for production will be considered:\n Rangelands Project 1: Restoration of\nRangeland Areas and Rangelands\n\n50,000 dunums in the Badia (Al Jafr and\nAl Husseinieh) sub-districts within the\nMa’an Governorate. It is assumed that the\nproductivity of these area will be 50 kg/\ndunum of dry matter (in areas with 100200 mm rainfall). Suggested plant types are\nperennial fodder shrubs. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n888,140 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2036).\n\n91\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nProject 2: New Protected Rangeland Area\n as Natural Reserve combined\n100,000 dunums in the wide desert valleys of\nsouth Badia. The average annual dry matter\nproduction is 4 kg/dunum in normal years\nand with good restoration practices, the\nproductivity can be increased to 15 kg/dunum.\nThe project will harness direct benefits for\nprotection of floral biodiversity through\ncontrolling the grazing of the indigenous\nAtriplex halimus shrubs. Much of this area is\ncovered with chert and an underlying thin\nlayer of fine textured soil. Artemisia herba-\nalba, Retama raetam, Achillea fragrantissima,\nAtriplex halimus and Poa bulbosa are common\nin the wadi beds. Despite its deterioration this\nregion is known to be the main grazing land\nin Jordan.\nIt is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 1,776,280 tonnes CO2\nover the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2036).\nThe projects will achieve reductions through CO2\nemissions offset from natural soil carbon release\ncaused by rangeland deterioration. The project will\nharness direct benefit for soil resources through\nrain harvest techniques as well as soil erosion\ncontrol techniques (erosion is caused by flow from\nflash floods). It is assumed to have an average of 35\naverage sized shrub/dunum and the sequestration\nrate is 5.57 tonnes SOC/ha/year and a lifetime of\n15 years will be assumed for calculation purposes.\n\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices\nin the Jordan Valley\nClimate smart agriculture is not a new agricultural\nsystem, nor is it a set of practices. It is a new approach,\na way to guide the needed changes of agricultural\nsystems, given the necessity to jointly address food\nsecurity and climate change. It contributes to the\nachievement of sustainable development goals\nand integrates the three dimensions of sustainable\ndevelopment (economic, social and environmental)\nby jointly addressing food security and climate\nchallenges. It is composed of three main pillars:\nSustainably increasing agricultural productivity\nand incomes; adapting and building resilience\nto climate change; reducing and/or removing\ngreenhouse gases emissions, where possible.\nSustainable crop production, controlled grazing\nand maintained forest systems can sequester\nsubstantial and variable amounts of carbon from\nthe atmosphere and store it in soils and vegetation.\nCarbon sequestration will not only stabilize climate\nbut will also increase the overall resilience of the\nagro-ecosystems. Widespread adoption of climate-\nsmart practices has the potential to make major\ncontributions to the achievement of national food\nsecurity and development goals. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will result in\na discounted emission reduction of 13,057 tonnes\nCO2 over the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2026).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nproposed AFOLU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed.

These mitigation projects\nare briefly described below.\n\nBiogas collection and utilization from AlDhulil domestic solid waste landfill. A\nconsiderable amount of biogas could only\nbe generated from Al-Dulail landfill while\nAl-Karak, Al-Salt and Madaba domestic solid\nwaste landfill sites were considered not valid\ndue to low production of gas in those sites.\n\nThe proposed project aims at collecting the\ngenerated biogas, treating it for impurities,\ngenerating electricity using biogas generator\nand connecting the generated electricity to\nthe national electricity grid. The suggested\nproject will contribute to reducing the\namount of fuel used for electricity generation.\nThe starting year for implementing this\nproject is 2022 and construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year,\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nproject will be in 2023. The lifetime of the\nproject is 25 years ( 2022 – 2047).\n\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge\ngenerated from the domestic wastewater\ntreatment plants. The project was considered\nto be valid for Wadi Arab, Baqa’a, and\nMadaba domestic wastewater treatment\nplants and thus emission reductions were\nrecalculated while it was considered invalid\nfor Ramtha and Salt due to decreased inflow\nof wastewater to these treatment plants.\n\nThe proposed projects aim at generating\nbiogas from the sludge and connecting\nthe generated electricity to the national\nelectricity\ngrid.\nThese\nprojects\nwill\ncontribute to reducing the amount of fuel\nused for electricity generation, taking into\nconsideration that a considerable amount\nof sludge produced from the wastewater\ntreatment plants without any utilization.\nIn the three projects of Wadi Arab, Baqa’a,\nand Madaba the construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nprojects will be the next year. The starting\nyear for implementing the proposed projects\nin Madaba and Wadi Al Arab is 2021 for a\nlifetime of 25 years (2021 to 2046) while the\nproject in Baqa’a will be implemented in 2025\nfor a lifetime of 25 years (2025 to 2049).\nThe following assumptions were used during the\nupdate of waste projects:\n\nTotal amount of organic material generated\nis assumed to increase annually by 2.2%,\n\nDensity of methane is 0.717 kg/m3,\n\nThe captured methane from all landfills\nis calculated according to the PRIF study\n(Environment and use of methane from\nmunicipal waste in Amman, 1993), where\nthe average value is used,\n\nElectricity grid emission factor is considered\nto be 0.4585 kgCO2/KWh,\n\nThe calculation of generated electricity in MW\nis based on 8,000 working hours per year,\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nsludge produced at wastewater treatment\nplants is assumed to be sold at a fixed price of\n0.094 JD/kWh (each kW produced is assumed\nto replace 1kw sold from the electricity grid),\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nbiogas produced from landfills is assumed\nto be sold at a fixed price of 0.06 JD/kWh,\n\nThe cost of a 1 MW biogas electricity\ngeneration landfill system (generator, wells,\npiping, etc.) is 1.5 million JD, according to\nthe International Renewable Energy Agency\n(IRENA),\n\nThe cost of 1 MW biogas electricity generation\nfrom biogas system (digester, WWTP\ngenerator, piping, etc.) is 4 million JD (Jordan\nbiogas project),\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of\nmaintenance, operation, overheads and\nsupervision costs (3% of capital cost) in\nwastewater\ntreatment\nplant\nsystems,\n\n94\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of maintenance,\noperation, overheads, and supervision costs\nin biogas projects in landfills (5% of capital\ninvestment, according to IRENA).\nAll mitigation options under the waste sector were\nconsidered as energy measures because the biogas\nwill be used for electric power generation. The cost\nand the CO2 emission reductions are analyzed for\nthe 5 proposed projects. A summary of the results\nis shown in the following table 3.15.\nTable 3.15: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nwaste mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost (JD/\ntonne of CO2eq)\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil\ndomestic solid waste landfill\n1,003.66\n- 0.50\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Wadi Arab domestic wastewater treatment\nplant\n280.30\n- 4.00\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Baqa’a tertiary domestic wastewater\ntreatment plant\n188.03\n4.48\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Maddaba domestic wastewater treatment\nplant\n188.23\n4.54\n3.3.7 Main results of updating the FBUR mitigation measures\n3.3.7.1 GHG emissions reduction of the updated measures\nTwenty three GHG mitigation projects out of the 39 projects that were proposed previously in the FBUR\nare still valid. The yearly GHG emission reductions were recalculated for each mitigation measure over\nits lifetime. Table 3.16, shows the total GHG emission reductions of the 23 measures for selected years.\nTable 3.16: GHG total emissions reductions (Gg of CO2eq) from the updated measures for selected years\nYear\nTotal GHG Emissions Reductions of the 23 updated measures\n(Gg of CO2eq)\n2025\n1,511.45\n2030\n2,487.75\n2035\n2,591.57\n2040\n2,400.42\n2045\n3,228.82\n2050\n1,220.47\n\n95\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.7.2 GHG abatement cost analysis for the\nupdated projects\nGHG abatement cost was recalculated for the 23\nprojects in addition to the yearly and reduced\nemission reductions. These projects belong to\nseveral sectors and subsectors including primary\nenergy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste,\nand agriculture.\nIt is concluded from the abatement cost analysis\nfor the updated FBUR valid projects that the most\nfeasible options are the energy mitigation projects.\nThe findings indicated that in particular the energy\nefficiency should receive the most attention. Table\n3.17 shows the abatement marginal cost for all\nmitigation measures ranked from the highest\nto the lowest and figure 3.1 shows the updated\nmitigation projects grouped by sector.\nFigure 3.1 Abatement marginal cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for all updated mitigation measures grouped by sector\n Legend: AGRI- AFOLU projects, waste- waste projects, IPPU- Industrial Processes projects, RE- Renewable Energy Projects,\nEE- Energy Efficiency Projects and PE-Primary Energy Projects)\n\n96\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.17: All updated mitigation projects ranked from the highest GHG reduction cost (JD/tonne CO2eq) to\nthe lowest cost\nProject Name\nEmissions\nReduction Unit\nCost (JD/tonne\nof CO2eq)\n1\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 1)\n118.68\n2\nForestry- Introduction of new plantations in Urban Areas\n40.00\n3\nRangeland 1- Restoration of Rangeland Areas\n18.00\n4\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Northern Area\n14.50\n5\nRangeland 2- New Protected Rangeland Area as Natural Reserve\n10.00\n6\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Madaba\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.54\n7\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Baqa’a tertiary\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.48\n8\nCatalytic Reduction of N2O inside the Ammonia Burner of the Nitric Acid\nPlant\n0.37\n9\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil domestic solid waste\nlandfill\n-0.50\n10\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Wadi Arab\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n-4.00\n11\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 2)\n-7.18\n12\nNatural gas distribution network in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\n-13.78\n13\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw materials needed to\nproduce clinker\n-22.90\n14\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45% of Pozzolana\n-32.00\n15\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\n-32.10\n16\nUse of biomass (domestic solid waste or/and sewage sludge) as\nalternative fuels in cement plants\n-69.30\n17\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water tanks in food\nindustry\n-108.04\n18\nLoss reduction in transmission and distribution\n-108.52\n19\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional burners in steel\nindustry\n-110.03\n20\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 houses\n-183.64\n21\nSolar water heaters 3- 30,000 houses\n-189.95\n22\nInsulating pipes, fittings and tanks in food industries\n-215.16\n23\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices in the Jordan valley\n-1333.00\n\n97\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nReferences\n\nAshley Murray and Lynn Price, 2008.

Some of these elements are implemented at\nthe international level and others at the national\nlevel.\nAt the international level, the MRV framework for\ndeveloping countries includes:\n\nGuidance on reporting through National\nCommunications (NCs) and Biennial Update\nReports (BURs),\n\nGuidance on setting up domestic MRV\nframeworks,\n\nA process for consideration of information\nsubmitted by developing countries in their\nBURs through an International Consultant\nand Analysis (ICA),\n\nInternational guidance on MRV for those\ndeveloping\ncountries\nthat\nvoluntarily\nimplement reforestation and avoided\ndeforestation activities and wish to take the\nopportunity of a results-based payment.\nAt the national level, Parties to the UNFCCC\nare expected to implement these international\nguidance and to prepare and report information\nevery two years through their NCs and BURs.\nThe list of information elements to be reported\nincludes annual GHG emissions inventories,\nmitigation actions and their estimated effects, as\nwell as technical and financial support needed and\nreceived. Jordan was among the first developing\ncountries to submit its first NC under the UNFCCC\nin 1997.\nMRV is central to effectively implement the NDCs,\nwhich describes countries mitigation goals and\npolicies submitted under the Paris Agreement.\nMeasurement is needed to identify emissions\ntrends, determine where to focus Green House\nGas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts, track\nmitigation-related support, assess whether\nmitigation actions planned under the NDCs\nare effective, evaluate the impact of support\nreceived, and monitor progress achieved in\nreducing emissions. Reporting and verification\nare important for ensuring transparency, good\ngovernance, accountability, and credibility of\nresults, and for building confidence that resources\nare being utilized effectively.\nAt COP 13, through the Bali Action Plan, Parties\nagreed on the principle of applying MRV for\ndeveloping country Parties, which laid the\nfoundation for the subsequent elaboration of\nthe existing comprehensive MRV framework for\ndeveloping country Parties. MRV occurs at the\ninternational level, but can also be voluntary at\nthe national level.\n4.2 Jordan’s multi-tiered MRV system\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its Market Readiness Proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\n(PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined a plan for\nimplementing the market readiness components\nthat will be necessary to support the development\nof appropriate market based instruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n\nA national MRV system and registry for\nclimate\nmitigation\nmeasures,\n\nDesigning a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n\nExploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\n\n101\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith developing a multi-tiered integrated MRV\nsystem. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE); adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors and will serve in tracking progress\ntowards Nationally Determined Contribution\n(NDC) commitments.\nThe main functions of the system are shown in\nthe figure below (adopted from PMR initiative\nbrochure, 2018), and they are described briefly\nin the subsequent sections.\nFigure 4.1: The main functions of the MRV system (adopted from PMR initiative Brochure, 2018).\nData Extracting, Transforming & Loading:\nthe system acts as database for GHG emissions\nat project, ministry, sectoral and national levels,\nwith main functions of; metadata1 viewing and\nediting, reference2 data monitoring, emissions\ndata monitoring and uploading data in a standard\nformat or automatically importing data.\nData Processing: the system provides a database\nof validated emissions and reduction, with main\nfunctions of pre-determined calculations of data\ncompared to previous years and calculation of\nGHGs and emission reduction based on proxy\ndata3 and modelled scenarios.\n2.

Also,\nnon-Annex I parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity-building and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility,\nParties included in Annex II to the Convention\nand other developed country Parties, the Green\nClimate Fund and multilateral institutions for\nactivities relating to climate change, including for\nthe preparation of the current biennial update\nreport.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nAccordingly, this chapter aims at providing a\nbrief description of the constraints and gaps\nidentified in previous national climate change\ncommunications and the First Biennial Update\nReport (FBUR). It will also identify newly arising\nconstraints and gaps, and needed actions and\nresources required to overcome them.\n5.2 Institutional Constraints and Gaps and\nPolicy Mainstreaming\n5.2.1 Current institutional arrangements\nClimate change (CC) Directorate, Environment Law\nNo. 6/2017 and CC bylaw No.79/2019.\nThe Directorate of Climate Change was established\nat the MoEnv in 2014 to act as the institutional hub\nfor coordinating and developing all climate change\nactivities in Jordan in relation to the UNFCCC and\nthe global climate change governance system and\ninitiatives.\nJordan has issued in May 2017 a new Environmental\nProtection Law (No.6/2017) that mandates the\nMoEnv to “coordinate national efforts to project\nClimate Change impacts, identify the sectors\naffected, and limit and mitigate greenhouse gas\nemissions by means such as funding, technology\ntransfer and reallocation of available funding and\nits distribution to Climate Change activities”.\nAnother significant milestone, is the issuance of\nthe Climate Change Bylaw No. 79 in 2019 which\nwas adopted pursuant to article no. 30(a) of the\nEnvironmental Protection Law No. 6/2017. The\nBylaw came as a response to the need to define\na framework that establishes a clear institutional\nsetting to address climate change challenges\nand ensure full engagement of all partners and\nstakeholders including both the technical experts\nand the decision makers.\nUnder the provisions of this bylaw, a National\nClimate Change Committee (NCCC) has been\nformed. This Committee is chaired by the Minister\nof Environment and consists of the secretary\ngenerals and high level members from the related\ninstitutions.\nThe bylaw identified the responsibility of the\nMoEnv as UNFCCC focal point to:\na. Seek approval from the NCCC on proposed\npolicies and strategies to adapt to the\nnegative impacts of climate change, and\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to be\nsubmitted to the Cabinet for adoption and\ninclusion in sectoral policies and strategies,\nb.\nPrepare nationally determined contributions,\nnational communication reports, biennial\nupdate reports, national adaptation plans\nand other climate change relevant documents\nand update them according to international\nconventions and obligations,\nc. Represent the Kingdom in international\nclimate change commissions and conferences,\nd.\nCreate and manage a national inventory\ndatabase to document emissions data,\nmitigation and adaptation measures and\nclimate finance data,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n107\ne. Authorize accredited entities to verify the\nresults of national inventory reports according\nto a criteria that will be set for this purpose,\nf. Provide technical support to scientific research\ncentres through opening up channels of\ncommunication with equivalent international\nclimate research centres,\ng.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders to\ndevelop a national climate finance plan, that\nidentifies projects, programmes and plans of\npriority,\nh.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders with\nregard to climate change market mechanisms.\nIn addition to the NCCC, technical teams are\nnominated according to specific needs; consisting\nof experts and specialists from governmental\norganizations, scientific research institutions, civil\nsociety organizations, and other related entities\nidentified in the bylaw.\nAlso, the bylaw set a group of entities mandated to\nsupport the MoEnv with providing data, available\nat their entities, needed for GHG inventory\nestimation, NDCs and financial support tracking.\nEstablishment of Green Economy Unit\nA Green Economy Unit was established at the\nMoEnv in 2014, with the purpose of coordinating\nthe national efforts regarding developing and\nupdating the green economy national strategies\nand legislation in accordance with the sectoral\nneeds. This unit works hand in hand with the\nClimate Change Directorate (CCD) to support\nenvironmental and climate action in Jordan, while\nalso achieving sustainable economic green growth\nobjectives.\nIn 2017 and with the support of Global Green\nGrowth Institute (GGGI) and UNEP, a National\nGreen Growth strategy, was published, it has\nidentified green growth as a top national priority.\nThen, recently in 2020, the Green Growth National\nAction Plans for (2021-2025) was launched for\nsix main sectors (energy, waste, water, transport,\nagriculture and tourism).\nNDC Partnership\nIn March 2017, Jordan through the MoEnv joined\nthe NDC Partnership as a member country, Jordan\nbecame a part of the global coalition of 130\ncountries and institutions working together to\nmobilize support and achieve ambitious climate\ngoals. As a global coalition emerging from the\nParis Agreement, the NDC Partnership works with\nJordan to shift the NDC’s focus from commitment\nto implementation, supporting fast-tracked,\nenhanced NDC implementation. By facilitating and\ncoordinating the delivery of technical and financial\nsupport and knowledge services, the Partnership\naims to bridge Jordan’s NDC implementation\nneeds with Partnership resources.\nTo accelerate the implementation of its NDC, the\nGovernment of Jordan (GoJ) unveiled its NDC\nAction Plan in April 2019. Jordan’s NDC Action\nPlan is a detailed statement of measures aligned\nwith the mitigation and adaptation objectives\nstated in its NDC. It offers a concrete roadmap\nfor transitioning to a low-emissions and climate\nresilient economy by increasing the share of\nrenewables in the energy mix and scaling up\nenergy efficiency measures; adapting to the\nimpacts of climate change in water, agricultural\nand health sectors; and strengthening the\nresilience of vulnerable groups and ecosystems.\nThe measures listed in the Action Plan are at\ndifferent stages of development and require\ndifferent types of support, including technical\nsupport for feasibility studies, developing\nfinancing strategies, monitoring and evaluation\nservices, and financial support for implementation\nof the investment ready measures.\nMainstreaming climate change at the national\nlevel\nOn the national level many institutions made\nconsiderable progress in including climate\nchange in their entities mandates. Many\nnational institutions established climate change\ndirectorates or units to follow up with Ministry of\nEnvironment, such as the ministries of Agriculture,\nWater and Irrigation, Transport, The National\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n108\nAgriculture Research Centre, and The Royal\nJordanian Geographic Centre.\nAlso, recently the Ministry of Environment\nsigned an agreement with King Abdullah II\nCentre for Excellence to update the Environment\nSustainability Award for industries to enhance their\ncommitments towards environment protection\nincluding the reduction of GHGs.\nThe private sector is engaging as well, with a\nunit for energy and environmental sustainability\nestablished in Jordan Chamber of Industry,\nthrough which they work with the industries\nand the government to encourage low emission\ntechnologies.\nOne of the most recent strategies that was recently\nlaunched, is the National Energy Strategy 2020\n– 2030. This strategy aims to reduce the CO2\nemissions by 10% by 2030. Also the Agriculture\nDevelopment National Strategy 2020-2025\nfocused on adaptation and the impacts of climate\nchange on biodiversity and land degradation.\nAt the city level, Greater Amman Municipality in\ncooperation with Ministry of Environment and\nWorld Bank launched in 2018 “Amman Climate\nPlan - A Vision for 2050 Amman”. This inaugural\nplan sets an interim target of a 40% reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This plan sets\nout a shared vision for collaboration among the\ngovernment, private sector, development partners\nand residents of Amman. This plan is a living,\nevolving document that the city will continue to\nbuild on until reaching a carbon-neutral city in\n2050.\n5.2.2 Identified gaps and constraints and\nrecommendations to address them\nThe CCD at Ministry of Environment, as UNFCCC\nfocal point, plays a pivotal role in climate change\nactivities at the national level. However, the\ndirectorate needs strengthening in term of human\nresources and sustainability. It is recommended\nto increase the number of the staff and enhance\ntheir capacity to be able to carry out their huge\nresponsibilities in the long term.\nAlthough the climate change bylaw was issued\nin 2019, it is not fully functioning yet. Up to date,\nthe number of meetings, between the NCCC and\nthe technical teams is not sufficient and no major\ndecisions have been taken on the ground. Also,\nthere are entities identified in Annex (3) of the\nbylaw who are responsible for providing needed\ndata for the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory\nestimation, however, only a slight improvement\nwas detected in providing and facilitating\ncollection of data and still more collaboration is\nneeded.\nThe following are some recommendations to\nenact and activate the bylaw, its committee and\ntechnical groups:\n\nIt is recommended that MoEnv as chair of\nthe NCCC highlights continually the role of\ndifferent ministries and institutions in the\narea of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n\nSeek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to the climate change bylaw, in\nareas relevant to their roles,\n\nIt is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at\nleast 3 years) to be able to strengthen their\nwork and it’s highly recommended to prepare\ntheir successors in advance,\n\nCCDs at different ministries and institutions\nare important vehicles to mainstream climate\nchange into the strategies and policies of\ntheir respective institutions. As such, it is\nrecommend that the MoEnv coordinates\ncontinuously with these departments and\nsupports them in identifying their capacity\nbuilding needs.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n109\n5.3 Technical and Capacity Building Needs\n5.3.1 Identified gaps and capacity building needs\nthrough the Technical Analysis- ICA process\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the\nUNFCCC was prepared and submitted in late 2017.\nAfter its submission, a Team of Technical Experts\n(TTE) were formed by the UNFCCC secretariat to\nperform review. These experts were trained to\nconduct reviews as part of the ICA according to\nDecision 2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s first BUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify capacity-building needs\nof developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NCs:\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series;\nb.\nDevelop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources;\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis;\nd.\nDevelop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and Emission\nFactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis;\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct\nongoing surveys to provide accurate data\nand to integrate climate change questions\nin existing energy surveys that mainly focus\non energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng.\nEnhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh.\nEnhance technical capacity to report\non mitigation actions that are already\nimplemented or ongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress\nand the underlying steps envisaged for the\nplanned mitigation actions and when they\nwill be implemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\n5.3.2 Reported capacity-building needs in Jordan’s\nFBUR\nThe following capacity-building needs were\nreported in the FBUR (most of them are still valid)\ncovering the following areas:\nGHG inventory preparation, including:\n\nThere is a need to build capacity in the use\nof the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Software.\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 did not provide emission estimates for\nindirect GHGs such as CO, NOx, NMVOC, and\nother gases not controlled by the Montreal\nProtocol, such as SOx because the 2006 IPCC\nSoftware does not support the estimation of\nthose gases,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n110\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 have been estimated using the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines, which have structural and\nmethodological differences with the Revised\n1996 IPCC Guidelines used in estimating GHG\nemissions inventories for earlier NCs, which\nmade it difficult to provide a consistent time\nseries,\n\nIn preparing all GHG inventories so far, default\nemission factors were used since there are\nno available studies to develop national\nemission factors. The use of national emission\nfactors is highly vital, particularly for key\ncategories within the inventory.\n GHG mitigation measures, including:\n\nStakeholders had limited expertise and\nknowledge\ncapacity\nfor\nconducting\nmitigation analysis for the transportation,\nIPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors,\n\nThe complex nature of mitigation actions\nand initiatives that are being developed\nand implemented within the UNFCCC had\nbeen a challenge. The various potentials and\nfeatures of Clean Development Mechanism\n(CDM), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs), Low Emission Development\n(LED), Intended Nationally Determined\nContributions (INDCs), and other mitigation\ntools make it difficult for a holistic planning\nperspective in climate change mitigation,\n\nData quality, completeness, and accuracy\nare of a primary concern when it comes to\nestablishing the baseline and mitigation\nanalysis. Data are not up to date, nor are\nthey readily available in one place.\n5.3.3 Capacity building needs and\nrecommendations to fulfill commitments under\nthe Paris Agreement (PA)\nThe Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency\nFramework (ETF) places new and more strict\nrequirements on developing countries. To\nimplement these new requirements capacitybuilding support is vital. Article 11 of the PA\nemphasizes the importance of building the\ncapacity of developing country Parties. The\nobjective is to allow them to take effective\nclimate change actions, particularly via the\nimplementation of adaptation and mitigation\nactions, so as to facilitate “technology development,\ndissemination and deployment, access to climate\nfinance, relevant aspects of education, training and\npublic awareness and the transparent, timely and\naccurate communication of information”.\nAlso, capacity building is essential to drive climate\ntransparency. The 2015 PA outlines an “Enhanced\nTransparency Framework” including greater\nrequirements for developing countries. Some\ndeveloping countries have struggled to fulfill preParis Agreement transparency requirements and\nwill need capacity-building support to implement\nthe PA’s more stringent requirements (WRI\nWorking paper, 2019).\nThe new requirements for the PA’s enhanced\ntransparency framework have shown that\nthese requirements represent greater efforts\nto communicate on climate change action and\nsupport. Countries agreed on the guidelines\nfor the enhanced transparency framework in\nDecember 2018. However, new efforts to build\ncapacity for the transparency framework need not\n“start from scratch” but should build on and learn\nfrom the history of transparency and capacity\nbuilding under the UNFCCC.\nThe processes under the PA, including the\ntechnical expert review and the facilitative,\nmultilateral consideration of progress under\nArticle 13, the global stock take under Article 14,\nand the mechanism to facilitate implementation\nand promote compliance under Article 15 are\nexcellent capacity-building instruments since\nthey help countries improve their transparencyrelated governance systems and improve data\nand information needs for reporting. Building or\ndeveloping capacity is a process that takes time\nand requires Jordan to “learn by doing”, and by\nleveraging national experiences, lessons learned,\nand emerging tools or approaches developed over\nthe past 20 years.\nCapacity for transparency can be strengthened\nthrough enhanced governance and institutional\nstructures and supported by the right participatory\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n111\napproach. Jordan must organize institutional and\ngovernance structures able to collect, report, and\nuse data for decision-making. Governments’ ability\nto engage effectively with key stakeholders is\ncritical to obtaining data of quality and in turn\nproviding the right signals and guidance to\nconvince stakeholders to support government’s\nefforts.\nLasting systems and knowledge are critical to\nbuilding capacity. More effort is required to\nbuild the critical knowledge within key national\ninstitutions, by looking at the educational\nchannels and exploring further pedagogical\napproaches, including twinning programs, to\nproduce active national and regional peer and\nprofessional communities. National capacitybuilding centres—national universities and\ntraining centres—need to play a central role\nin the building of more durable processes for\ncollecting and managing better data, while\ncreating sustainable skills and jobs.\nJordan has already started the capacity building\nprocess by taking part in the BUR ICA (as\nmentioned\npreviously).\nAs for the implementation of Article 6 (A6) under\nthe PA, Jordan has recently started the work of\npreparing a roadmap to promote and facilitate\nJordan’s engagement in A6. A working committee\nhas been formed, aiming at raising awareness and\nbuilding the capacity of the national stakeholders.\nArticle 6 has three operative paragraphs, two\nof which relate to carbon markets: (1) Article\n6.2 provides an accounting framework for\ninternational cooperation, such as linking the\nemissions-trading schemes of two or more\ncountries. It also allows for the international\ntransfer of carbon credits between countries, (2)\nArticle 6.4 establishes a central UN mechanism to\ntrade credits from emissions reductions generated\nthrough specific projects, (3) Article 6.8 establishes\na work program for non-market approaches, such\nas applying taxes to discourage emissions.\nWhile A6 established these concepts in broad\nstrokes and countries achieved some progress\non defining the rules over the years, their final\nshape remains yet to be agreed.\n5.4 Technology Needs Assessment and\nTechnology\nTransfer\nThe Ministry of Environment, with Global\nEnvironment\nFacility\n(GEF)-UNDP\nsupport,\nhas previously published a Technology Needs\nAssessment (TNA) and technology transfer report\nfor 2004-2005. More recently, the Ministry has\ncompleted a climate change technology needs\nassessment for Jordan for the period 2015-2017,\nwhere three reports have been published by\nthis project. The first report is for the selection\nof priority mitigation and adaptation sectors\nfor TNA activities in Jordan. The second report\npresented a list of the main barriers and an\nenabling framework, while the third report,\nwhich was published in August 2017, offered a\ntechnology action plan for two priority mitigation\nsectors (energy and transport) and two priority\nadaptation sectors (water and agriculture).\nThe following TNA analysis is extracted from the\nthree published reports.\nThe top three mitigation technologies for the\nenergy sector were:\n(1) Solar thermal,\n(2) PV for electrification, and\n(3) PV for water pumping.\nThe three top-ranked priority mitigation\ntechnologies for the transportation sector were:\n(1) Bus Rapid Transit,\n(2) Improving pedestrian infrastructure, and\n(3) Ticketing systems to improve the quality and\nthe attractiveness of public transport services.\nThe final results for the water sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Roof-top rainwater harvesting,\n(2) Augmenting and expansion of Water Users\nAssociation (WUAs), and\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n112\n(3) Desalination and brackish water treatment\nand re-use.\nThe results for the agricultural sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Water saving technologies, such as drip or\nsubsurface irrigation,\n(2) Farm-level water harvesting, and\n(3) Plant varieties resistant to climate change.\nAlso recently, in April 2020, the Green Growth\nAction Plan (GGAP) was published by MoEnv,\nidentifying clearly the relation between the green\ngrowth and the climate change. The GGAP focused\non many interventions related to technology and\nknowledge transfer in the six sectors; the below\nare selected technologies that were identified:\nEnergy\n\nImprove energy demand management\nthrough development of a smart electricity\ngrid,\n\nImplement electric vehicle charging stations\nand services provision in Greater Amman\nMunicipality through a public-private\npartnership,\n\nDevelop and implement a national energy\nstorage action plan and investment pipeline,\n\nIncrease public investment in energy sector\nresearch and development,\n\nImprove the enabling environment and\ncapacity development support for the\ngrowth of the Energy Services Companies\n(ESCOs) market.\nTransport\n\nSupport the deployment of Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS) to allow a modal\nand fair integration of the public and private\ntransport systems in the city of Amman,\n\nEstablish a national centre of excellence and\ncapacity building program for sustainable\ntransport,\n\nDevelop a national electric mobility strategy\nand action plan,\n\nDesign and implement a public transport\nelectric mobility pilot and capacity building\nprogram in Amman.\nWaste\n\nEstablish a national centre for excellence on\nwaste management and circular economy\nto promote innovation, training, R&D,\ninvestment, and policy work,\n\nConduct market assessment and feasibility\nstudy to identify potential projects and\nprograms to divert organic waste from\nmunicipal solid waste streams.\nWater\n\nTechnical Assistance to support water\nefficiency in businesses, industries, and\ncommercial activities (Based on SwitchMed1\nExperience),\n\nExpand the Samra Wastewater Treatment\nPlant (Phase III),\n\nUndertake Desalination of Seawater at the\nGulf of Aqaba through Renewable Energy\nSources.\nAgriculture\n\nMap and optimize research to impact\npathways to improve relevance of innovation\nefforts in the agriculture sector,\n\nDevelop a flexible crop planning and variety\nselection methodology and decisionmaking process based on crop-per-drop\nand economic competitiveness,\n\nDesign and implement program to support\ndemonstration resource efficiency projects\nin the olive cultivation and oil production\nsector,\n\nDevelop and implement pipeline of projects\n(all sizes) and policy recommendations to\nincrease use of aquaponics and hydroponics\nin urban and rural areas,\n\nUpgrade packaging, scaling, storage and\ncooling of fruits and vegetables managed\nby the private sector,\n\nPromote the development of organic\nagriculture through knowledge exchange\nand market development.\n1.

The 14% reduction of GHG emissions\nis divided into two parts. The first part seeks\nto achieve a 1.5% reduction in GHG emissions\nthrough unilateral actions, while the remaining\n12.5% reduction is contingent and conditional\non receiving international financial support. In\nits NDCs, Jordan put the estimate of reducing\nGHG emissions by 14% at USD 5.7 billion. To\nfinance mitigation measures in the energy sector,\nJordan will require USD 5,158 million to meet its\nconditional mitigation targets.\nWhile a significant proportion of this is likely to\ncome from international sources of finance, one\nof the key sectoral actions for the energy sector\nis attracting private sector finance and reducing\nadministrative obstacles in order to enable JREEEF\nto support investments at early stages.\nIn Jordan, the role of the private sector is crucial\nand essential in achieving our NDC, the very\nhigh ratio of (Debt: GDP) makes it difficult for\nthe Government to obtain loans. Therefore, the\ngovernment is considering the role that the\nmobilization of private investment can play a role\nin implementing and achieving our NDC.\nThe key challenges in financing climate change\nprojects are summarized as follows:\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and its\nnegative effects on health, the economy\nand society, it is expected that financial\nsupport from donors will be directed to the\nhealth sector to mitigate the effects of this\npandemic, and this may negatively affect\nthe availability of the required support from\ninternational bodies or public budgets at\nthe national level to implement projects\nto protect the environment in general and\nclimate change projects in particular,\n\nLack of Climate Finance Framework (policy\nor strategy),\n\nBanks in Jordan, in general, are interested in\nproviding finance to RE and EE projects. Banks\nprefer financing RE projects, particularly\nthose which are of a larger size and linked\nto their existing client base. EE and smaller\nsized projects are less preferred,\n\nTo minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n\nThere is a lack of appropriate financial\nproducts,\n\nProject developers lack technical capacity.\nThe work of public financing institutions, such\nas JREEEF and Jordan Environment Fund (JEF),\nalthough small scale, could play a crucial role in\npromoting early stage investments, particularly\nfor public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, and\nfor Projects with co-financing. For JEF to fund\nmitigation activities will require a widening of\nits current role to include a specific focus on\nmitigation activity, and the development of\nproject selection criteria including an assessment\nof projects’ impact on GHG emissions. In addition,\nJEF currently lacks adequate human, technical, and\nfinancial capability to perform its current role, it\nneeds strengthening at various levels to have an\nexpanded role.\nJREEEF now is active and has full and adequate\ninstitutional, technical, and financial capacity to\nmanage the fund, supported by a management\ncommittee, supportive legislation (JREEEF By-\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n114\nLaw), a transparent and effective governance\nstructure, a strategic business plan, and financial\nsupport windows.\nThe majority of financial resources pumped into\nenvironmental sectors in Jordan come from donor\ncountries through bilateral agreements that focus\non fiscal and developmental challenges in the\ncountry. Framework agreements and strategies\nwith major donors like UNDP, United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID),\nUNEP, EU, GIZ, UNIDO, and other agencies have\nbeen developed and they address a variety of\nsustainable development objectives. The donor\ncommunity is supportive of a public registry of\nprojects which would allow transparency and\ncoordination of ongoing activities, as well as the\nassessment of their cost effectiveness. In addition,\nthese donors are particularly supportive of\ndeveloping strong GHG MRV frameworks, believed\nto be key to demonstrating the effectiveness of\nclimate financing (details about the current MRV\ncan be found in section 4). Financial institutions\nand banks are interested in entering this new\nsector. Several green loans and programs are\nbeing established and green suppliers and\nmanufacturers are growing in number. However,\nthe market lacks proactive marketing and public\noutreach.\nPreviously an amount of 112 million JD were\nmade available for RE and EE financing in Jordan;\n76 million JD of the total were made available\nthrough the four commercial banks using the\nCentral Bank of Jordan’s window for RE and EE,\nand 36 million JD was made available through\nthe Agence Français de Development (AFD)\nfacility. This experience was not successful, key\nchallenges in disbursing these funds included\nthe lack of credible market references and short\ncredit history. Another challenge for banks was\nthe lack of sufficient knowledge to verify project\nassumptions, technologies, or risks.

Other gases\nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, such\nas sulphur oxides (SOx), included in the IPCC\nGuidelines may be included at the discretion\nof the Parties.\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 using the 2006\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) Guidelines and Software for Parties not\nincluded in Annex I of the UNFCCC.\nAll sector and subsector national experts used\nTier 1, since the current version of the software\nsupports only Tier 1. The sectors and subsectors\nthat were considered are the following:\n1. Energy:\nn\nn Stationary Combustion\nn\nn Mobile Combustion\nn\nn Fugitive Emissions\n2. Industrial Processes and Product Use\n(IPPU):\nn\nn Mineral Industry Emissions\nn\nn Chemical Industry Emissions\nn\nn Metal Industry Emissions\nn\nn Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent\nUse\nn\nn Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for\nOzone Depleting Substances and Other\nProduct Manufacture and Use\n3. Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU):\nn\nn Cropland and Forest Land\nn\nn Emissions from Livestock and Manure\nManagement\nn\nn N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2\nEmissions from Lime and Urea Application\n4. Waste Generation, Composition, and\nManagement Data\nn\nn Solid Waste Disposal\nn\nn Biological Treatment of Solid Waste\nn\nn Incineration and Open Burning of Waste\nn\nn Wastewater Treatment and Discharge\nThis chapter addresses emissions of carbon\ndioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4),\nsulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons\n(HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Those gases\nare supported by the software and the IPCC\n2006 Guidelines. Non-methane volatile organic\ncompounds (NMVOCs) emissions resulting from\nthe solvents subsector were estimated using\nEMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory\nguidebook 2013.\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n29\n2.2 Institutional Arrangements\nThe Ministry of Environment is the focal point for\nissues relevant to the UNFCCC and is responsible\nfor seeing that Jordan’s commitments are met.\nPreparation of Jordan’s FBUR was coordinated by\nthe Ministry of Environment in partnership with\nUNDP. An agreement with the Royal Scientific\nSociety (a national non-governmental, nonfor-profit organization for applied research)\nwas realized to achieve the work. The GHG\ninventory development was accomplished with\nthe participation of a pool of national experts\nrepresenting different national entities, as\ndemonstrated by the organizational chart in\nFigure 2.1.\nFigure 2.1: Organizational chart for national GHG inventory development\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n30\nIn addition to guidance on appropriate estimation\nmethods, the 2006 Guidelines include crosssectoral good practice guidance for inventory\npreparation. This includes collection of activity\ndata, key category analysis, quality assurance\nand control, and inventory planning and\ndocumentation.\nSince the IPCC Guidelines are intended to be\nused by all countries with different capacities,\nthey provide different tiers of methods for each\ncategory of emission source or removal category.\nThe higher tier methods (Tier 3 being the highest)\nare typically more detailed, data intensive, and\nrely on country-specific parameters to estimate\nemissions. In contrast, Tier 1 methods utilize more\naggregated data and default emission factors. The\n2006 IPCC Guidelines provide methodologies\nfor estimating national GHG inventories of\nanthropogenic emissions by sources and removals\nby sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by\nthe Montreal Protocol. The 2006 Guidelines are of\nfive volumes. Volume 1 describes the basic steps\nin inventory development and offers general\nguidance in estimating greenhouse gas emissions\nand removals. Volumes 2 through 5 offer guidance\nin making estimates for different sectors of an\neconomy.\n2.3 Methodology and Inventory\nEstimation\nThe IPCC Greenhouse Gas Guidelines provide\ndetailed methods for estimating GHG emissions\nby sources and removals by sinks. The 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines is an update of and was synthesized\nfrom the Revised 1996 Guidelines, Good Practice\nGuidance and Uncertainty Management in\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Good\nPractice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change,\nand Forestry.\nThere are some structural changes in the 2006\nGuidelines, such as combining the previously\nseparate Agriculture and Land-Use, Land-Use\nand Forestry (LULUCF) sectors into one sector, as\nshown in Figure 2.2. It is worth noting that the\ninventory methods in the 2006 Guidelines are just\nan update of the previous editions with additional\nsources and some new default emission factors.\nFigure 2.2: Structural differences between Revised 1996 and 2006 IPCC Guidelines\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n31\nTable 2.1: GHG net emissions by sector, 2010\nCategories\nEmissions\nCO2 Equivalents (Gg)\nPercentage of the\noverall\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n23140.06\n100%\nEnergy\n19410.88\n84%\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use\n1982.04\n9%\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n180.50\n1%\nWaste\n1567.49\n7%\nIn preparing Jordan’s FBUR inventories, the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines and the IPCC Software (versions\n2.16 and 2.17) were used.\nNational inventories for years 2010 and 2012 were\nestimated. And as per the guidelines, four sectors\nwere considered, namely, Energy, Industrial\nProcesses and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture,\nForestry, and other Land Use (AFOLU), and Waste.\n Inventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nand in units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by sources and removals by sinks.\nNot all indirect GHGs were estimated. To\nimprove completeness of emission estimates, it\nis recommended to estimate them in the future\nby using the EEA Guidelines and methodology.\nFor reporting purposes, the notation keys NO\n(not occurring) or NE (not estimated) and NA\n(not applicable) were used as necessary in the\ninventory reporting tables.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC SAR (temporal horizon 100\nyears) were used (as per Decision 17/CP.8).\nThe following sections report Jordan’s GHG\ninventories by sector and on a gas by gas basis.\n2.4 GHG Inventories by Sector\nAccording to the overall GHG Inventory estimates,\nJordan contributed 23140.06 Gg of CO2-equivalent\n(CO2eq) in 2010. A breakdown of Jordan’s total\nemissions of GHGs by sector indicated that the\nEnergy Sector is the major emitter accounting for\n84% of total national emissions followed by the\nIndustrial Sector with a contribution of 9%. GHG\nemissions by sector in 2010 are shown in Table\n2.1 and Figure 2.3.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n32\nFigure 2.3: GHG net emissions (%) by sector, 2010\nIn 2012, Jordan contributed 27997.73 Gigagrams (Gg) of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq). A breakdown of Jordan’s\ntotal emissions of GHGs by sector indicated that the energy sector was the major emitter capturing\n81% of total national emissions followed by the industrial sector with a contribution of 12%. The 2012\nGHG emissions by sector are shown in Table 2.2 and Figure 2.4.\nTable 2.2: GHG net emissions by sector, 2012\nCategories\nEmissions\nCO2 Equivalents (Gg)\nPercentage\nof the overall\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n27997.73\n100%\nEnergy\n22756.83\n 81%\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use\n3368.47\n12%\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n237.29\n1%\nWaste\n1635.14\n6%\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n33\nIn the below sections, a detailed description is\ngiven for the emissions resulting from the sectors\nin years 2010 and 2012.\n2.4.1 Energy sector\nJordan has limited indigenous energy resources,\nleaving the country heavily dependent on energy\nimports to meet a growing demand, expected to\ndouble to a forecasted 15.08 million tons of oil\nequivalent (Mtoe) by 2020 from 7.357 Mtoe in 2010\nand 8.205 Mtoe in 2012. Moreover, rapid economic\ngrowth, population growth, and the successive\ninflux of refugees over the last decade have all\nimposed additional demands on energy resources.\nThe costs of energy imports have increased as\nhas the risk of interruptions in energy supplies.\nThis has spurred governmental action to improve\nenergy efficiency and search for additional energy\nresources.\nJordan imports 97% of its oil and gas, accounting\nfor almost 18% of the 2014 gross domestic product\n(GDP). This has made the country completely\nvulnerable to fluctuations in the global energy\nmarket. The current energy strategy is to transform\nthe energy mix from one heavily reliant on oil and\nnatural gas to one more balanced with a higher\nproportion of energy supplied by renewable\nsources.\nEnergy-related activities have a dominant share\nof GHG emissions in Jordan. Emissions from this\nsector are classified into two main categories:\nn\nn Emissions from fuel combustion, and\nn\nn Non-combustion (fugitive) emissions.\n2.4.1.1 GHG emissions in 2010\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n19410.88 Gg of CO2eq in 2010, resulting primarily\nfrom fuel combustion activities, as shown in Table\n2.3.

It has a\nland area of about 89 200 km2 and is rated among\nthe world’s most water poor countries.\nNatural ecosystems in Jordan support human\nactivities in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,\ntourism, traditional and pharmaceutical health\nproducts, and traditional medicine, among\nothers. According to the Ministry of Agriculture\n2007 survey, less than 5% of the country’s total\narea is arable land while grazing land makes up\n90% with 100–200 mm of annual rainfall. Natural\nand human-made forests cover around 1% of the\ncountry’s total area. The number of farm holdings\nis 80,000, at an average area of 40 dunum per\nholding (56,000 are plant production holdings\nand 14,000 are animal production holdings). Plant\nproduction holdings are mostly field crops, olives,\nfruit trees, and vegetables.\nThe contribution of agriculture to GDP in relative\nterms declined sharply from 40% in the 1950s\nto 4% in 2016. Irrespective of how humble the\ncontribution of agriculture is to national GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of agriculture stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source\nof food, in particular dairy products, fruits, and\nvegetables, but it is also a source of livelihood\nfor 25% of the total poor population (livestock\nkeepers, smallholder farm households, and\nlandless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas.\nTable 2.10: Emissions of the mineral industry, 2012\nCategories\nCO2eq (Gg)\nMINERAL INDUSTRY\n1531.31\nCement production\n1162.50\nLime production\n8.47\nOther Process Uses of Carbonates\n360.33\nFigure 2.10: Shares of emission (%) per subsector within the mineral industry subsector, 2012\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n41\nTable 2.11: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2010\nCategories\nNet CO2\n(Gg)\nCH4-\nCO2eq\n(Gg)\nN2O-\nCO2eq\n(Gg)\nNet\nCO2eq\n(Gg)\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n-263.89\n439.41\n4.97\n180.50\nLivestock\nNA\n439.11\n2.15\n441.26\nLand\n-274.56\nNA\nNA\n-274.56\nAggregate sources and non-CO2 emissions\nsources on land\n10.67\n0.298\n2.82\n13.80\nFigure 2.11: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2010\n2.4.3.1 GHG emissions in 2010\nthe most significant change made in the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines compared with the Revised\n1996 IPCC and GPG 2000 was in this sector.

The main responsible entities are the\nMinistry of Municipal Affairs, the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Greater Amman Municipality, and\nthe Special Economic Zones of Aqaba and Petra.\nSolid waste management is a major challenge in\nurban and rural areas, the concern for safe and\neffective SWM has been steadily increasing in\nJordan, due to the political, demographic and\neconomic conditions as well as the large numbers\nof refugees. The Kingdom lacks integrated\npractices for the collection, transportation,\ntransfer, treatment, and disposal of MSW. While the\nexisting municipal solid waste collection system\nis considered to be adequate in urban centers,\nservices tend to be poor or non-existent in small\ntowns and rural areas. Municipal and industrial\nsolid waste is primarily dumped at landfills. At\npresent, there are 18 official dumpsites in Jordan,\nmost of which are not properly designed or\noperated, demonstrated by their lack of proper\nlining, leachate collection system, or LFG (landfill\ngas) management system. Al-Ghabawi is the only\nsanitary landfill in Jordan.\nIn terms of wastewater management, Jordan\noperated its first sewage collection system in\nAmman in the late 1960s. The system was meant\nto collect wastewater and dispose of it either in\nliquid dumps or randomly in Wadis. The system\nhad adverse impacts on water resources and\nthe environment, leading to the construction of\nthe first wastewater treatment plant in Jordan\nat Ain Gazal in 1968. The government has since\nexpanded the construction of wastewater\ntreatment plants to increase coverage across\nJordan. As of 2016, the country has 33 public\nworking wastewater treatment plants that are\neither operated by the Water Authority of Jordan\n(WAJ) or controlled by the Project Management\nUnit (PMU) at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation.\nSamra Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)\nreceives more than 70% of wastewater diverted\nto WWTPs while Mansourah WWTP for septic tanks\nreceives around 0.005% of the total wastewater\ndischarged in 2012. The Jordan water strategy\n2016-2025 considered treated wastewater as a\nsource of water to replace part of good quality\nwater for agricultural purposes. In 2013, amount\nof treated wastewater exceeded 120 MCM and\ncurrently wastewater treatment plants serve most\nof the urban areas in the country.\n2.4.4.1 GHG emissions in 2010\nIn 2010, GHG emissions from the waste sector\nreached 1567.49 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for\n7% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions. Most of the\nemissions were generated by domestic solid waste\ndisposal, which accounted for 89% (1391.77 Gg of\nCO2eq) of total waste emissions, while wastewater\nhandling accounted for 11% (171.67 Gg of CO2eq)\nof total waste emissions.

It was expected for\nGHG emissions to grow with population growth\nand increased economic activities. However, this\nwas not the case. As shown in table 2.23, total\nnational GHG emissions were 28.71, 23.14, and\n27.99 Million Ton of CO2eq in 2006, 2010, and 2012,\nrespectively. These trends can be explained by\nthe following:\nn\nn The current inventories were estimated\nusing the 2006 IPCC Guidelines whereas the\nprevious inventory of the TNC was estimated\nusing the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The\ntwo guidelines vary in their use of emission\nfactors and additional sources.\nn\nn The energy sector emissions were affected\nby the interruption of the natural gas supply\nfrom Egypt, forcing Jordan to switch to the\nuse of more carbon intensive fuels such as\nheavy fuel oil (HFO).\nn\nn A significant change was made concerning\nland use classifications in the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines compared with the Revised 1996\nIPCC and GPG 2000. The 2006 Guidelines have\ncombined the approach of Land Use, LandUse Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) in GPG\nLULUCF and the Agriculture sector in GPG\n2000 into a single Agriculture, Forestry, and\nOther Land Use (AFOLU). This change has\naffected the results.\nn\nn The solid waste module was affected by\nchanges as well. The 2006 IPCC methodology\nfor estimating CH4 emissions from solid\nwaste is based on the First Order Decay\n(FOD) method while the Revised 1996 IPCC\nGuidelines is based on the mass balance\nmethod. The FOD method assumes that the\ndegradable organic carbon in waste decays\nslowly throughout a few decades, during\nwhich CH4 and CO2 are formed. As a result,\nemissions of CH4 from waste deposited in a\ndisposal site are highest in the first few years\nafter deposition, after which they gradually\ndecline, whereas the mass balance method\nassumes all emissions are produced in the\nfirst year of deposition.\nn\nn The phasing out of ODS in 2012, such as\nR-22 (that has no contribution to climate\nchange) and replacing it with HFCs (such as\nR-134a) that have high GWP had an impact\non increasing the overall results of the IPPU\nmodule in 2012.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n60\n2.8 Reference Approach\nThe Reference Approach and the Sectoral\nApproach often yield different results because\nthe Reference Approach is a top-down approach\nusing the country’s energy supply data and has\nno detailed information on how the individual\nfuels are used in each sector. This approach\nprovides estimates of CO2 to compare with\nestimates derived using a Sectoral Approach. The\nReference Approach provides an upper bound\nto the Sectoral Approach ‘1A Fuel Combustion’,\nbecause some of the carbon in the fuel is not\ncombusted but is released as fugitive emissions\n(as leakage or evaporation in the production\nand/or transformation stage). Calculating CO2\nemissions with the two approaches can lead to\ndifferent results for some countries.\nThe Reference Approach was used to calculate\nenergy sector emissions in 2010 and 2012 and the\nresults were compared to those of the Sectoral\nApproach. The gap between the two approaches\nis supposed to be relatively small (5% or less). For\nJordan, the calculated differences were acceptable;\nnot more than 2%, as indicated in Table 2.24 and\nFigure 2.19.\nTable 2.23: Comparison between national GHG inventories 2006, 2010 and 2012\nCategories\nRevised 1996 IPCC\n2006 IPCC Guidelines\nYear 2006 (TNC)\nYear 2010\nYear 2012\nCO2 eq (Gg)\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n28717\n23140.06\n27997.73\n1 - Energy\n20938\n19410.88\n22756.83\n2 - Industrial Processes and Product Use\n2550\n1982.04\n3368.47\n3 - Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\nAgriculture 1318\nLULUCF 866\n180.50\n237.29\n4 - Waste\n3045\n1567.49\n1635.14\nMemo Items (5)\nInternational Bunkers\n748\n994.75\n1024.37\n 1.A.3.a.i - International Aviation\n(International Bunkers)\n748\n941.86\n967.65\n 1.A.3.d.i - International Water-borne\nNavigation (International bunkers)\nNE\n52.89\n56.69\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n61\nGHG emissions were also estimated using the Reference Approach for the time series (2007-2012) and\nyielded a harmonized trend of emissions as shown in Table 2.25 and Figure 2.20.\nTable 2.25: Reference approach for time series (2007-2012)\nyear\nEnergy Consumption (TJ)\nCO2 (Gg)\n2007\n281336.32\n19077.83\n2008\n270707.89\n18160.63\n2009\n279999.32\n18605.04\n2010\n290308.49\n19479.65\n2011\n285718.7\n20403.51\n2012\n320408.08\n23010.29\nTable 2.24: Reference approach vs sectoral approach, 2010 and 2012\nyear\nReference Approach CO2 Emissions (Gg)\nSectoral CO2 Emissions (Gg)\nDifference\n2010\n19479.65\n19259.93\n1.14%\n2012\n23010.29\n22557.98\n2%\nFigure 2.19: Reference approach vs sectoral approach, 2010 and 2012\n24000\n23000\n22000\n21000\n20000\n19000\n18000\n17000\n2010\n2012\nCO2 Emissions (Gg )\nReference Approach\nemissions\nSectoral emissions\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n62\n2.9 Key Category Analysis\nThe key category analysis is an essential element\nfor inventory development and a driving factor\nto improve its quality. Non-Annex I Parties are\nencouraged (Decision 17/CP.8), to the extent\npossible, to undertake any key category analysis\nto assist in developing inventories that better\nreflect their national circumstances. The analysis\nwas carried out based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines\nand Software. Jordan used “level” key category\nanalysis where the contribution of each source\nor sink category to the total national inventory\nlevel was calculated. The Key categories according\nto the guidelines are those that, when summed\ntogether in descending order of magnitude, add\nup to 95% of the sum of all level assessment.\nIn categories that are identified as key, Parties\nshould try to use a recommended method, in\naccordance with the corresponding decision tree\nin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It is recommended\nthat Jordan searches for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to the\nextent possible and based on software readiness\nand national circumstances, Tier 2 methods in the\ncategories identified as key.\nIn the total national GHG emissions of 2010,\nvarious Fuel Combustion Activities subcategories\nwere among the top five sources accounting for\naround 66% of all emissions, mainly: Energy\nIndustries (Gaseous Fuels), Road Transportation,\nEnergy Industries (Liquid Fuels), Manufacturing\nIndustries and Construction (Liquid Fuels) and\nother sectors (commercial/institutional and\nresidential-Liquid Fuels). The IPPU, AFOLU, and\nwaste subsectors accounted for the balance, as\nshown in Table 2.26.\nFigure 2.20: Reference approach for time series (2007-2012)\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n63\nTable 2.26: Key category analysis (level assessment), 2010\nA\nB\nC\nD\nF\nG\nIPCC\nCategory\ncode\nIPCC Category\nGreenhouse\nGas\n2010\nEmissions\nCO2eq (Gg)\n2010\nEmissions\nLevel from\nthe Given\nCategory\nCumulative\nTotal % of\nColumn F\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nGaseous Fuels\nCO2\n5345.70\n0.187\n19%\n1.A.3.b\nRoad Transportation\nCO2\n5156.63\n0.180\n37%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nLiquid Fuels\nCO2\n3750.36\n0.131\n50%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2298.74\n0.080\n58%\n1.A.4\nOther Sectors - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2266.68\n0.079\n66%\n4.A\nSolid Waste Disposal\nCH4\n1391.77\n0.072\n74%\n2.A.1\nCement Production\nCO2\n1038\n0.051\n81%\n2.D\nNon-Energy Products\nfrom Fuels and\nSolvent Use\nCO2\n467.68\n0.049\n86%\n1.A.5\nNon-Specified - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n415.74\n0.028\n89%\n3.A.1\nEnteric Fermentation\nCH4\n408.85\n0.016\n91%\n2.F.1\nRefrigeration and Air\nConditioning\nHFCs, PFCs\n335.91\n0.015\n92%\n3.B.1.a\nForest land Remaining\nForest land\nCO2\n-274.78\n0.014\n93%\n2.A.4\nOther Process Uses of\nCarbonates\nCO2\n165.60\n0.010\n94%\n2.B.2\nNitric Acid Production\nN2O\n151.34\n0.006\n95%\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n64\nWhereas in the total national GHG emissions\nof 2012, various Fuel Combustion Activities\nsubcategories were among the top four sources\naccounting for around 73% of all emissions,\nmainly: Energy Industries (Liquid Fuels), Road\nTransportation, other sectors (Liquid Fuels)\nand Energy Industries (Gaseous Fuels). Energy\nIndustries (Gaseous Fuels) moved down from the\nfirst place to the fourth place in 2012 compared\nto 2010 list due to the decrease in Egyptian\nGas supply.

Uncertainty\ninformation is intended to help prioritize efforts\nto improve the accuracy of inventories and guide\ndecisions on the methodological choice.\nThe analysis was carried out based on IPCC\n2006 Guidelines and Software. “Approach 1:\nPropagation of Error” was used. Approach 1 is\nbased upon error propagation and is used to\nestimate uncertainty in individual categories in\nthe inventory as a whole, and in trends between\n2012 and the base year 2010. The uncertainty\nanalysis was based on Tier 1 approach and covers\nall source-categories and all direct greenhouse\ngases. The uncertainty estimation for the activity\ndata and emission factors was based on typical\nvalues of the IPCC.\nThe results indicate that net emissions in 2012\nwere 34575.36 Gg of CO2eq with an uncertainty\nof ±5%, which corresponds to a 95% probability\nrange of 26737.83 to 29257.63 Gg of CO2eq. Based\nupon the total base year of 2010 and year 2012\ninventories, the average trend is a 21% increase\nin emissions from 2010 to 2012. The uncertainty\nin the trend is ±6% (percentage points), which\ncorresponds to a 95% probability range for the\ntrend of 26% to 38% with respect to base year\nemissions.\n2.11 GHG Inventory Review\nThe national GHG inventory was subjected to two\nlevels of review, as follows:\nn\nn An internal review was performed by the RSS\nproject management team throughout the\nlifetime of the project. The review covered all\nsectoral reports and changes that have been\nintroduced to the reports as new versions.\nn\nn An international review was coordinated by\nthe UNDP-UNEP Global Support Program\n(GSP) and was conducted in June 25-28,\n2017, by a consultant expert in national\nGHG emissions inventories. This was based\non the indications included in Annex III to\nDecision 2/CP.17 (UNFCCC, 2011) and the\nIPCC Guidelines and guidance required in\nthis decision to be used for the non-Annex\nI Parties to present biennial update reports\n(BURs) to the Convention.\nReferences\nn\nn 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse\nGas Inventories.\nn\nn EEA, 2016.

The\nsectors considered for their mitigation potential\nin this report are those that were addressed in\nthe Third National Communication (TNC), namely,\nenergy (primary energy, renewable energy,\nenergy efficiency and transport), waste, industrial\nprocesses, and agriculture, forestry, and other land\nuse (AFOLU).\nFor this purpose, two updated scenarios were\nconstructed; baseline and mitigation scenarios:\nn\nn The baseline scenario reflects a future in which\nthere are no policies or programs designed to\nencourage or require actions that reduce GHG\nemissions or enhance carbon sinks. Defining\na reasonable baseline scenario is considered a\ncritical element in the abatement assessment\nsince the benefits and incremental costs of\nmitigation options are directly linked to the\nsound definition of the baseline scenario. The\nupdated baseline scenario in this chapter was\nconstructed based on the trends, plans and\npolicies prevailing in the Jordanian context\nduring the time of preparation of this chapter\n(2016 and 2017). The development of this\nscenario required a projection of the current\nlevels to future levels of each type of activity\nfor the interval 2015-2040. Such projection\ndrew on assumptions made about population\ngrowth, GDP, and other macro variables, which\nwere obtained from official institutions.\nn\nn\nn\nn The mitigation scenario in the TNC was\nstructured according to a set of criteria\nreflecting country-specific conditions such\nas the potential for significant impact on\ngreenhouse gas emissions, direct and\nindirect economic impacts, consistency with\nnational development goals, the potential\neffectiveness of implementation policies,\nsustainability of an option, data availability for\nevaluation, and other sector-specific criteria.\nIn this chapter, the mitigation scenario is\nupdated in terms of mitigation options status.\nAll mitigation options that became part of\nthe baseline scenario or became invalid were\nremoved from the current scenario, while all\nother remaining mitigation options were\ncounted in after adjustments were made in\ntheir expected implementation timeline and\nin their associated GHG emission reductions.\nSome newly identified options were added as\nwell to the current mitigation scenario.\nThe overall baseline and mitigation scenarios\nare constructed to cover the period 2015-2040.\nThe analytical methodology of the energy sector\nis based on the LEAP Model, the Long-Range\nEnergy Alternative Planning System. LEAP is an\nintegrated modelling tool developed to track\nenergy consumption, production, and resource\nextraction in all sectors of an economy. In addition\nto tracking GHGs, LEAP can also be used to analyze\nemissions of local and regional air pollutants,\nmaking it well-suited to studies of the climate\nco-benefits of local air pollution reduction. The\nLEAP tool is used for the first time in Jordan in\nthe energy mitigation analysis. In former national\ncommunications to the UNFCCC, the Energy and\nPower Evaluation Program (ENPEP) was used.\nThe energy baseline scenario delineates 2015 as\na base year and considers the policies, programs,\nand projects that have been incorporated in the\nenergy strategy for 2015-2025 as committed and\nconfirmed inputs for building up the baseline\nscenario up to 2040 using the LEAP Model. For nonenergy sectors (IPPU, AFOLU, and Waste), linkages\nto demographic, macroeconomic, and other sector\nspecific factors were used to build up the scenario\nutilizing statistical and economic tools.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n69\n3.2 Importance of TNC Update\nSince submission of the TNC to the UNFCCC in\nNovember 2014, new developments have affected\nthe national economy and social conditions. This\ngives added importance to the need to update\nthe mitigation analysis for all sectors. The major\nchanges that took place in 2015 and 2016, can be\nsummarized as follows:\nIn 2015, “Jordan 2025” was launched and adopted\nas a national strategy. The document articulated\na vision for promoting the rule of law, upholding\nequal opportunity, increasing participatory\npolicy making, achieving fiscal sustainability, and\nstrengthening institutions. The Jordan 2025 vision\naspires to achieve real economic growth rates of\n7.5% in 2025, at an annual rate of 5.7% within the\nvision period. The energy sector was one of the\nmain sectors addressed in the document aiming at\nsecuring Jordan’s sustainable development efforts.\nA new census was conducted and published in\nDecember 2015, the main findings were:\nn\nn The population of Jordan was 9,531,712\n(compared to 6.9 million used in the TNC\nbaseline scenario for 2015).\nn\nn The population doubled more than 10 times\nover the past 55 years; most of the increase\ntook place during the past decade, especially\nafter 2011 due of influxes of refugees.\nn\nn The population of those of Jordanian origin\nwas 6,613,587 accounting for 69.4% of the\ntotal population.\nn\nn Non-Jordanian population made up 30% of\nthe total population. Almost half of them\nare Syrians (1.3 million) and one third of\nthem (about 436 thousand) live in Amman\nGovernorate.\nn\nn The population of Amman Governorate\nexceeded 4 million.\nA new energy strategy for the period 2015-2025\nwas prepared and approved in December 2015.\nThe strategy provided a plan for the future energy\nmix, particularly for electricity generation, and\nthe consequences of increasing the generating\ncapacity of renewable sources of energy on the\nelectricity generation and transmission system\nand on the share of nuclear energy in electricity\ngeneration. Additional energy relevant changes\nwill be outlined under the energy baseline section\nof this chapter.\n3.3 Sources of Data and the Main\nMacroeconomic and Demographic\nConsiderations\nThe main macroeconomic data considered for\nthe baseline scenario were obtained from official\nsources as follows:\nn\nn Economic Growth Rate: The economic\ngrowth rate or the gross domestic product\n(GDP) considered in the baseline scenario is\nconsistent with that targeted in “Jordan 2025:\na National Vision and Strategy”, which seeks to\nachieve a real economic growth rate of 7.5%\nin 2025 at an annual growth rate of 5.7%.\nn\nn The value-added figures considered for the\neconomic sectors were those that are stated\nin “Jordan 2025”.\nn\nn Population figures for Jordanians and nonJordanians and family size data were based\non the findings of the census of 2015, while\npopulation growth rates for Jordanians and\nnon-Jordanians were obtained from the\nDepartment of Statistics-Jordan.\nn\nn The official discount rate used was 8%, as\ndetermined by the Ministry of Planning and\nInternational Cooperation.\nn\nn Historical energy data for 2013- 2015 were\nobtained from the energy balances issued by\nthe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources\n(MEMR) for 2013, 2014, and 2015, which\nillustrate the energy flow from the supply side,\ntransformation and into the demand side.\nn\nn Detailed\ndata\nfor\nhistorical\nenergy\nconsumption patterns by each sector and for\nthe technologies used for 2013- 2015 were\nobtained from the energy surveys conducted\nby MEMR as follows:\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n70\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the transport sector, 2012.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the household sector, 2013.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the services sector, 2014.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the agricultural sector, 2014.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the commercial sector, 2013.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the industrial sector, 2013.\nTable 3.1 shows the economic growth rate of GDP in real terms, the structural composition of GDP, and\nthe growth rate (GR) of population.\nTable 3.1: GDP and population, 2015-2040\nItem\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nPopulation (million)*\n9.531\nJordanian (%GR) *\n6.613\n2.9\n2.7\n2.3\n2.0\n1.9\nNon-Jordanian (%GR)\n2.918\n2.4\n2.2\n1.8\n1.5\n1.5\nGDP (million JD) **\n26640\n34790\n46510\n62820\n80150\n102300\nGDP (%GR) **\n3.1\n4.91\n7.53\n6.2\n5.0\n5.0\nStructural Composition of GDP (Value Added) %\nServices Sector\n68.1\n61.4\n58\n52\n50\n48\nIndustrial Sector\n22.4\n27.4\n29.5\n32\n33\n34\nConstruction Sector\n4.2\n5.8\n6.6\n8\n8.8\n9.8\nAgricultural Sector\n2.9\n3.4\n4.1\n5.9\n6.0\n6.0\nNon-Profit Organization\n2.4\n2.0\n1.8\n2.1\n2.2\n2.2\n*Department of Statistics\n**Jordan Vision 2025\nNon-Jordanians are comprised of three major\ngroups. The first group is made up of Syrians\nwho entered Jordan during the 1984-1986\nSyrian conflict and stayed in Jordan to this date.\nThe size of this first group is 700,000 (2015).\nThis first group is regarded as Jordanian for the\npurpose of calculating population growth rates.\nThe second group is made up of Syrian refugees\nwho entered Jordan during 2011-2016 Syrian\nconflict with an estimated size of 630,000. The\npresence of this second group is driven by the\npolitical and security situation in Syria. The third\ngroup is Egyptian workers, whose stay is driven\nby economic considerations and regulated by\ngovernment labor policies.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n71\n3.4 Baseline Scenario for the\nDifferent Sectors\n3.4.1 Baseline scenario for the energy\nsector\n3.4.1.1 Updates on TNC baseline\nscenario\na. Energy Demand and Supply Updates\nn\nn Throughout the period 2011-2014, the energy\nsector has experienced several setbacks\ncaused by the rise, at the time, in the price of\ncrude oil and oil derivatives, the interruption\nof the Egyptian gas supply, and the shift to\nmore expensive fuel for electricity generation.\nAnd with a rise in the demand for electricity\nduring the same period from 2.8% and 6.4%\nin 2011 and 2014, respectively, energy imports\nhave reached 4.1 billion JD in 2013 and 4.5\nbillion JD in 2014, an increase of around 10%.\nn\nn One of the main drivers behind the high\ngrowth rate in the demand for energy and\nelectricity is the presence of 1.3 million\nSyrian refugees comprising 20% of Jordan’s\npopulation and to whom Jordan is obliged to\nprovide essential water and energy services.\nn\nn In 2015, the energy sector was affected by the\nfall in crude oil prices in the global market to\nUSD 30 per barrel. This decrease led to delays\nin implementing many infrastructure energy\nprojects listed in the TNC baseline scenario.\nn\nn The liquefied natural gas (LNG) jetty in Aqaba\nwas put in operation in September 2015,\nallowing Jordan to meet the country’s needs\nof LNG for electricity generation. Concurrently,\ngovernment electricity subsidies for the\nelectricity generation sector were phased out.\nn\nn As a result, the heavy burden on Jordan’s\neconomy has been decreased. Government\nenergy expenditures in 2015 were 2.5 billion\nJD, equal to 13% of GDP, compared to 4.5\nbillion JD in 2014 (18% of GDP).\nb. Delayed energy infrastructure projects\nlisted in the TNC baseline scenario\nn\nn Oil shale projects for electricity generation:\nConstruction of an oil shale 470 MW power\nplant to generate electricity via direct burning\nwas considerably delayed because of a failure\nin reaching a financial closure. The new\nexpected date for commercial operation has\nmoved to 2020. In addition, the construction\nof another oil shale 600 MW power plant by a\nconsortium of Emirati and Chinese companies\nwas cancelled. Consequently, achieving the\n11% target for oil shale contribution in the\nenergy mix by 2020 is no longer attainable.\nThe updated share of oil shale in the energy\nmix will be up to 8% by 2025.\nn\nn Oil shale surface restoration projects: Change\nin the economic feasibility have affected\nthe ability of companies working in surface\nrestoration of oil shale fields to fulfill their\nagreed-upon obligations on schedule. All oil\nshale companies were asked to postpone their\ndevelopment period for five to eight years.\nSome oil shale companies have completely\nstopped their projects in the aforementioned\nfields in the meantime.\nn\nn Oil and gas exploration: The British Petroleum\nCompany has completely stopped its\ndevelopment and exploration operations in\nthe Risha natural gas field in 2014 because\nthe reserves of natural gas discovered were\nnot deemed commercially viable.\nn\nn Expansion of Jordan Oil Refinery Project:\nThe Jordan Oil Refinery was unsuccessful\nin pushing ahead with the 2015 refinery\nexpansion project, designed to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products and\nto improve the specifications of petroleum\nproducts.\nn\nn Due\nto\nregional\npolitical\ninstability,\nconstruction of the Iraqi crude oil pipeline\nwas delayed. The pipeline was supposed to\ntransport Iraqi crude oil across Jordan to the\nexport terminal in Aqaba.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n72\nc. Infrastructure projects, policies, laws, and\nby-laws of the TNC - under implementation\n“as planned”\nn\nn Crude oil and oil products storage: All strategic\nstock projects of Jordan to increase the\nstorage capacities of crude oil and oil products\nwill be completed and put in operation by\nthe end of 2017.\nn\nn Natural gas projects: The construction of\nLNG jetty at Aqaba seaport, the connection\nto the Arab gas pipeline, and the leasing of a\nfloating storage and regasification unit (FSRU)\nwere successfully implemented and put in\ncommercial operation in September 2015.\nn\nn Renewable energy: Considerable progress has\nbeen achieved in utilizing renewable energy\nfor electricity generation. Currently, confirmed\nrenewable energy generation capacity has\nexceeded the renewable generating capacity\nof 960 MW by 2020 projected in the TNC\nbaseline scenario. As of end of 2015, 300\nMW of solar and wind projects have been\nconnected to the grid. By the end of 2017,\naround 550 MW of solar and wind is scheduled\nto be connected to the grid. Furthermore,\nsmall scale consumers have been given the\nopportunity in 2016 to generate their own\nelectricity and sell the excess (if any) to the\ndistribution utilities at a fixed tariff. Currently,\naround 70 MW of installed capacity as rooftop\nsystems have been installed.\nn\nn Energy Efficiency: Previously, all the activities\nin the energy efficiency field were considered\nin the mitigation scenario. A huge progress\nwas done by establishing the Jordan\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency\nFund (JREEEF).\nn\nn The laws and by-laws considered in the TNC\nbaseline scenario:\n-\tThe Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency\nlaw was approved as a permanent law in\n2012 and amended in 2014. The law allows\ninvestors to identify and develop gridconnected electricity production projects\nthrough the so called unsolicited or direct\nproposal submission.\n-\tThe bylaw of Direct Proposals of Renewable\nEnergy Projects has been issued in Mid-2015.\n-\tA well-founded reference price list (ceiling\nprices) for different renewable energy\ntechnologies was set by the Energy and\nMineral Regularity Commission (EMRC).\n-\tNet-metering for small renewable energy (RE)\nsystems (roof tops) with fixed purchase prices\nfor excess power has been set.\n-\tTax incentive: a bylaw was issued granting\ntax exemptions for RE and EE systems and\nequipment.\n-\tGrid expansion and reinforcement plans are\nongoing through the implementation of the\nGreen Corridor project.\n-\tThe JREEEF has been established.\nTable 3.2 summarizes the status of the energy\nbaseline scenario projects as stated in TNC.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n73\nTable 3.2: The status of the energy baseline scenario projects as stated in TNC.\nNo.\nProject\nStatus\nDate of\noperation\nCapacity\nRenewable Energy\nWind Energy\n1\nWind Project in Tafila\nIn operation\nSept. 2015\n117 MW\n2\nWind Project in Ma’an /Gulf Grant\nIn operation\nMarch 2016\n80 MW\nSolar PV\n3\nSolar PV Project in Mafraq\nIn operation\n2015\n10 MW\n4\nSolar PV Project in Azraq/Spanish Grant\nIn operation\nMarch 2016\n5 MW\n5\nSolar PV Projects/Direct Proposal\nSubmission- Stage I - 12 Projects - 9 of\nwhich in Ma’an\nUnder construction\n2016-2017\n200 MW\n6\nSolar PV Projects/Direct Proposal\nSubmission- Stage II - Northern & Eastern\nparts of Kingdom\nUnder construction\n2016-2017\n200 MW\n7\nSolar PV Project in Qweira /Gulf Grant\nUnder construction\n2017\n100 MW\nNatural Gas LNG\n8\nLNG terminal/Aqaba\nIn Operation\n2015\n9\nDevelopment of Risha Natural Gas Field\nCancelled\n50 MMcfd\nOil Shale\n10\nOil Shale Direct Burning 1 Estonian\nDelayed\n2020\n470 MW\n11\nOil Shale Direct Burning 2 Chinese\nConsortium\nCancelled\n600 MW\nOil and Oil Products\n13\nStorages of Crude Oil & Oil Products\nUnder construction\n2017\n430 Kt\nElectricity Generation\n14\nIPP3\nIn operation\n2015\n573 MW\n15\nIPP4\nIn operation\n2015\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n74\n3.4.1.2 The energy baseline scenario\nup to 2040\nAs mentioned earlier, changes in the economy\nand the energy sector since 2015 have affected\nthe sector’s strategies, policies, plans, activities,\nand projects. Therefore, the baseline scenario\nfor the period 2015-2040 has been reviewed and\nrebuilt, consistent with the new energy strategy\nof 2015-2025.\na. The new energy strategy of 2015-2025\nBased on the changes that have affected the\nenergy sector since 2015 driven by reduced\noil prices and the remarkable progress in the\nadoption of renewable energy projects, which\nwas facilitated by the declining cost of renewable\nenergy technologies, a new strategy for the\nenergy sector, consistent with “Jordan 2025”, was\nadopted and approved by the Ministerial Council\nin December 2015.\nThe new energy strategy seeks to:\nn\nn Achieve a secure sustainable supply of energy\nand optimal utilization of natural resources.\nn\nn Increase the contribution of local energy\nresources in the country’s energy mix.\nn\nn Reduce the burden of energy costs on the\nJordanian economy.\nn\nn Study the impacts of renewable energy\nprojects on the power generation system.\nAccording to the energy strategy 2015-2025 and its\ncomponents, the most probable baseline scenario\nin the energy sector will be based on the current\nsituation in the energy sector, the government’s\nefforts being made to achieve security of energy\nsupply, the adopted goals, policies, and laws in the\nenergy sector, and the planned and committed\nprojects within the energy strategy.\nb. Energy baseline scenario during the\nenergy strategy period 2015-2025\nThe policies, projects, and activities considered\nin the baseline scenario up to 2025 and beyond\nto the year 2040 are described below:\n1. The field of oil and oil products\nSecuring the Kingdom’s oil products needs will\nbe achieved by the following:\n-\tThe Jordan Petroleum Refinery will continue\nto produce 14 thousand tons per day (100\nthousand barrels), and the remaining\nneed of oil products will be imported. This\narrangement is supposed to last up to 2040.\n-\tThe Jordan Petroleum Refinery will proceed\nforward with implementing the expansion\nof the oil refinery to increase its capacity\nof converting heavy petroleum derivatives\nto light products and to improve the\nspecifications of petroleum products. The\nexpansion will be completed by 2022.\n-\tJordan will continue to meet its crude oil needs\nby importing Saudi Arabian oil via sea. The\ncrude will then be shipped by trucks to the\noil refinery. This arrangement is supposed to\nlast up to 2022.\n-\tConstruction of a pipeline will proceed forward\nto ship 1 million barrels per day of Iraqi crude\noil across Jordanian territory to the export\nterminal in Aqaba, in addition to a branch to\nsupply JPR with 150 thousand barrels per day\nof crude oil. The pipeline will be completed\nby 2022.\n-\tThe policy of petroleum products price\nliberalization will be sustained, as well as\npricing oil products on a monthly basis in\naccordance with changes in international\noil prices as a tool to improve the efficiency\nof consumption.\n-\tThe implementation of the oil sector\nrestructuring program and the establishment\nand operation of the logistics companies will\nbe completed.\n-\tProject work for the storage of strategic stocks\nof petroleum products sufficient for 60 days\nwill be implemented by:\nn\nn The construction of 100 thousand tons of\nstorage capacity for crude oil in Aqaba on\nengineering, procurement, and construction\n(EPC) basis.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n75\nn\nn The construction of strategic storage\ncapacities for light oil products with a\ncapacity of 250-300 thousand tons, and for\nLPG with a capacity of 8 thousand tons for\nLPG in the middle of Jordan on EPC basis to\nbe commercially operated in 2017.\nn\nn The establishment of the Oil Logistics\nCompany to secure the strategic storage\ncapacity of oil and oil products needed for\nthe country.\nIf the refinery expansion project does not get\nimplemented, the government will study the\nfollowing options:\n-\tOpen the way and announce the investment\nopportunity to build new oil refinery in Jordan.\n-\tDiscontinuing operations in the existing\nrefinery.\n-\tImporting oil products to meet Jordan’s needs.\nThis arrangement will achieve the following goals:\n-\tLinearization of oil products markets on\ncompetitive\nbasis.\n-\tImproving the specifications of the oil products\nin the local market.\n-\tImproving the quality of services delivered to\nthe consumers.\n2. The field of natural gas\nAs stated earlier, Jordan has the ability to meet\nthe country’s needs of natural gas for electricity\ngeneration and for industrial uses following\nconstruction of LNG terminal in Aqaba, which\nwas put in commercial operation in September\n2015. In 2016, 90% of electricity generation in the\nKingdom was based on natural gas delivered via\nthe Aqaba LNG terminal.\nThe demand for natural gas for electricity\ngeneration during the period 2016-2022 was\nestimated to be 350-420 MMcfd. During the period\n2023-2025, the estimated demand dropped to\n150-250 MMcfd due to substitution by oil shale\nand nuclear power which will come online during\nthe period in question. The demand for natural\ngas by the industrial sector was estimated to be\n150 MMcfd during the same period.\nIn addition to the LNG terminal in Aqaba, other\nregional options to supply Jordan with natural\ngas include Egypt and Gaza.

The Field of Nuclear Energy\nJordan’s interest in nuclear energy stems from the\nneed to address the challenges represented by the\nscarcity of domestic energy and water supplies.\nTo provide domestic long-lasting sources of\nenergy, the National Strategy of Energy of 2007\nhas strengthened the role of developing domestic\nand diversified sources of energy by introducing\nnuclear energy as an alternative to electricity\ngeneration. Hence, the Jordan Atomic Energy\nCommission (JAEC) was created in 2008 to achieve\ntwo major goals:\nn\nn To transfer, develop, and sustain the\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and radiation\ntechnology in the Kingdom; and\nn\nn To promote investment projects in radiation\ntechnology and nuclear energy such as\nelectricity generation and water desalination\nas well as other nuclear projects that boost\nthe national economy.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n80\nThe JAEC has selected the nuclear power plant\nsite in Amra.  JAEC announced that Rosatom’s\nreactor export subsidiary, Atom Story Export (ASE),\nwould supply two nuclear units on a build, own,\nand operate (BOO) basis with a capacity of 1000\nMW each. The first reactor will be commissioned\nin 2023 and the second in 2025 as stated in the\nnew energy strategy 2015-2025. The two nuclear\npower plants include third generation technology\nof Russian reactors which upholds the highest\nstandards of nuclear safety and security.\n3.4.1.3 Primary and final energy\ndemand\n- Primary energy demand\nBased on the baseline scenario analysis taking\ninto account all committed projects as well as the\neconomic variables, the LEAP output shows that\nthe primary energy required will be 10.3 Mtoe,\n11.53 Mtoe, and 16.33 Mtoe in 2020, 2025, and\n2040, respectively, with an annual growth rate of\n2.4% during the period 2015-2040 (full data are\npresented in Table A.1, Appendix A).\nTable 3.5 and Figure 3.1 show the total primary\nenergy requirements for selected years during the\nperiod 2015-2040.\nTable 3.5: Primary energy requirements (million tons of oil equivalent)\nBaseline scenario\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nEmissions\n9.24\n9.69\n9.93\n10.11\n10.3\n11.53\n13.68\n15.31\n16.33\nFigure 3.1: Primary energy requirements\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n81\n- Primary energy mix\nThe primary energy mix for some selected years within the study period is shown in Table 3.6 and Figure\n3.2. The primary energy mix in 2020 will consist of 50% oil products, 30% natural gas, 9% renewable\nenergy, and 6% oil shale, while in 2025 the primary energy mix will consist of 48% oil products, 7%\nnatural gas, 9% renewable energy, 22% nuclear, and 5% oil shale. The decline in natural gas contribution\nin the energy mix is attributed to the introduction of nuclear power into the mix in 2023 and 2025.\nTable 3.6: Primary energy mix (thousand toe), 2015-2040\nFuels\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nOil products\n6885\n5177\n5590\n6283\n5960\n6370\nNatural gas\n1752\n3113\n823\n1972\n2550\n2970\nRenewables\n170\n955\n1030\n1290\n1410\n1490\nNuclear\n-\n2945\n3010\n3010\n3010\nOil shale\n620\n645\n645\n1300\n1630\nCoal\n420\n448\n450\n420\n700\n750\nOthers\n13\n17\n47\n60\n80\n110\nTotal\n9240\n10330\n11530\n13680\n15010\n16330\nFigure 3.2: Primary energy mix (%), 2015-2040\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n82\nFinal energy demand by sector\nFinal energy demand (consumption) is the\ntotal energy consumed by end users, such\nas transportation, household, industry, and\nagriculture.\nIt is the energy which reaches final consumers’\ndoor and excludes energy used by the energy\nsector itself. In Jordan, it is mainly oil products\nand electricity.\nThe final energy demand by sectors for the baseline\nscenario up to 2040 is driven by GDP, population\nsize, population growth rate, and the value added\nby each sector over the period in question. The\nfinal demand is also driven by behavioral changes\nby the end users, modernization, and the price of\nthe final energy consumed. All of these variables\nhave been factored in the LEAP model. Table 3.7\nand Figure 3.3 show the final energy demand\nby sector for selected years during the period\n2015-2040 (full data are presented in table A.2,\nAppendix A).\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n83\nFinal energy demand in the transportation\nsector\nThe transportation sector accounted for 48%\nof the total final energy demand in 2015. The\ncurrent energy intensity of the transportation\nsector, measured at 0.07 Kgoe/Km per person\nand 0.05 Kgoe/ton per kilometer traveled, is\nconsidered too high as a result of a low specific\nload per vehicle (1.3 passenger/vehicle) and a lack\nof modern public transport system. This share of\nthe transportation sector is expected to decrease\nto 46% and 42% in 2020 and 2025, respectively,\ndue to the improvement measures that will be\nintroduced to the sector including the Bus Rapid\nTransit, service upgrade in public transport, and\nincreased penetration of hybrid and electric cars.\nFinal energy demand in other sectors\nThe industrial sector’s final energy consumption as\na percentage of the total final energy will increase\nfrom 17% in 2015 to 27% in 2040, consistent with\nthe sector’s targeted value added stated in “Jordan\n2025”. The services sector will experience a high\naverage growth rate of 5% annually, capturing\n10% of the total final energy consumption in 2040,\nup from 6% in 2015.\nAs for the share of the household final energy\nconsumption, it will decrease from 22% in 2015 to\n17% in 2040. The household sector will experience\na medium growth rate of 1.4% annually. This is\nprimarily attributed to the pricing mechanism\nused and to the shift towards more efficient\ndevices.\nTable 3.7: Final energy (thousand toe) demand by sector, 2015-2040\nBranches\nIndustrial\nResidential\nServices\nTransport\nOther\nTotal\n2015\n991\n1,272\n367\n2,810\n387\n5,828\n2020\n1,307\n1,443\n484\n3,133\n510\n6,876\n2025\n1,722\n1,592\n637\n3,401\n672\n8,024\n2030\n2,192\n1,706\n811\n3,639\n855\n9,203\n2035\n2,630\n1,778\n973\n3,784\n1,026\n10,191\n2040\n2,974\n1,800\n1,101\n3,822\n1,161\n10,857\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n84\nFigure 3.3: Final energy (thousand toe) demand by sector, 2015-2040\nFor more details, Tables A.3-A.6 in Appendix A\nshow the projected energy balances generated\nby LEAP for the selected years 2020, 2025,\n2030, and 2040.

It contributed directly and\nindirectly to about 40% of GDP through its linkages\nwith other key sectors such as transportation,\ninsurance, and trade.\nThe industrial sector consists of two subsectors,\nmanufacturing and mining. The manufacturing\n(converting) subsector includes chemicals,\nelectrical, engineering and construction, food\nand beverages, glass and ceramic, tobacco and\ncigarettes, paper and cartoon, pharmaceuticals\nand medical, printing and packaging, and textile\nand leathers. The mining subsector includes\nphosphate, potash, salt, carbonate, lime and\nlimestone, fertilizers, cement and construction.\nMineral extraction from mines and quarries is\nalso included.\nGovernmental strategies, policies, plans, and\nprojects to improve the industrial sector as well as\nplans by relevant companies have been reviewed\nto build the baseline scenario. The documents\nthat have been examined include the Ministerial\nStatement (governmental working plan 2013-\n2016), the national industrial policy (industrial\nsupport program 2010-2014), and Ministry of\nTrade, Industry, and Supply strategy (2014-2016).\nIn addition, “Jordan 2025” addresses the industrial\nsector with a focus on assisting in financing and\nincentivizing the development and sustainability\nof Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Also,\nin 2014, a High-Level Committee and a Unit for\nGreen Economy were established by a decree by\nthe Prime Minister, on the basis of which a National\nGreen Growth Plan for Jordan was developed by\nthe Ministry of Environment to be followed by\nan action plan for transitioning towards a green\neconomy.\nBased on this review, the following are a summary\nof the main plans/activities of the government\nto improve the industrial performance in Jordan:\n-\tSupport the development of the industrial\nsector and improve its competitiveness\nto effectively contribute to economic\ndevelopment of the country.\n-\tProtect intellectual and innovation rights in\nbusiness and establish the principles of the\nfree market’s rules.\n-\tSupport small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n-\tImprove the investment environment to attract\nforeign investments in all Governorates.\n-\tImprove infrastructure services needed for\nindustrial activities.\n-\tImprove education and vocational training to\nprepare qualified labor for industrial jobs.\n-\tEnhance communication between research\nand development centers and industries to\ncatalyze technology transfer and improve the\nutilization of knowledge.\n-\tEnhance the adaptation of Best Available\nTechnology (BAT) and Best Environmental\nPractices (BEP) in industrial processes.\n-\tImprove regulations and policies to encourage\nindustrial investment.\n-\tEnhance cooperation between the private and\npublic sectors.\n-\tEstablish a national strategy to improve\nthe penetration of local products into\ninternational export markets.\n-\tImprove the financial support mechanism to\nencourage industrial investments.\n-\tProvide technical support to industries\nto help them comply with technical and\nenvironmental standards.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n89\nGDP growth rates, as stated in” Jordan 2025”, and\npopulation growth rates during the period 20152040 have been used to update the projections of\nproduction, extraction, and import of industrial\nproducts that generate GHGs in Jordan up to\n2040.

Natural and human-made forests cover\naround 1% of the country’s area. The number of\nfarm holdings is 80,000, with an average area of 40\ndunum per holding (56,000 are plant production\nholdings and 14,000 are animal production\nholdings). Plant production holdings are mostly\nfield crops, olives, fruit trees, and vegetables.\nThe contribution of agriculture to the GDP in\nrelative terms declined sharply from 40% in\nthe 1950s to 4% in 2016. Irrespective of how\nhumble the contribution of agriculture is to GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of the agricultural\nsector stems from the fact that it is not only a\nmajor source of food, particularly dairy products,\nfruits and vegetables, but it is also a source of\nlivelihood for 25% of the total poor population\n(livestock keepers, smallholder farm households,\nand landless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n90\nThe following were common objectives among\nall policies, strategies, plans, and programs\nannounced by the Ministry of Agriculture:\n-\tPromotion of sustainable and long-term use of\nresources in agricultural production.\n-\tConservation of biodiversity and promotion\nof sustainable use in agricultural production.\n-\tCombating desertification and strengthening\ntechnical capacities of people working in the\nagricultural sector to cope with probable\nclimate and environmental changes.\n-\tControl urban expansion on agricultural and\nforest land.\n-\tRestore degraded ecosystems of rangelands\nand forests through community based\nrangeland\nrehabilitation.\nThe baseline scenario for this sector was\nconstructed based on available governmental\nplans,\nprograms,\npolicies,\nand\nstrategies\nannounced and published by the Ministry of\nAgriculture, the Directorate of Forests, and other\nrelevant institutions. Consistent with these plans,\nthe following considerations have shaped the\nbaseline scenario:\nn\nn Field crops production: Increase productivity\nper unit area, promote water harvesting\ntechniques to expand planting areas, and\nmaintain productivity under predicted\ndecrease in rainfall.\nn\nn Animal production: Promote high productive\nanimal species under increase in prices of\nfodder, and other production inputs.\nn\nn Fodder production: Reclamation of rangelands\nand control overgrazing of rangelands,\nintroduce species with high productivity\nunder drought conditions and promote\nwastewater reuse in fodder production.\nn\nn Forestry conservation: Maintain forests which\nare threatened by predicted drought cycles,\nurban and rural expansion, expected fire\noccurrences, and illegal deforestation.\nTables A.8 to A.12 in Appendix A summarize actual\nand projected numbers of livestock, actual and\nprojected production of annual crops, actual and\nprojected areas for forest plantation, and number\nof perennial crops during the period 2015-2040.\nThe assumptions that directed the projections in\nthe agricultural activities up to 2040 are as follows:\nn\nn An assumed annual increase in livestock\nnumbers by 3% at the national level (taking\ninto consideration the positive annual\npopulation growth and the need to secure\nfood supply under scarce resources and\nproduction limitations that is projected\nto increase with climate change adverse\nimpacts).\nn\nn An assumed increase in the annual production\nof different crops by 3% at the national level\nand an associated 7% increase in the amount\nof added fertilizer.\nn\nn Changes in forest land\n-\tAn assumed increase in forest plantation areas\nby 1%.\n-\tAn assumed increase in the private forest\nholdings by 1%.\n-\tProtected natural forests with maintained\nconstant areas.\n3.4.4 Baseline scenario for waste\nsector\nThe waste sector in Jordan handles three categories\nof waste: municipal solid waste, domestic\nwastewater, and industrial wastewater. Municipal\nsolid waste is transported directly to landfill sites\nor to transfer stations, where it is compacted\nand retransferred to landfills using larger trucks\nto improve operational efficiency and reduce\ncost. Dumpsites are managed by Joint Services\nCouncils except for the Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nis operated and managed by the Greater Amman\nMunicipality. Fifty percent of municipal waste is\ndumped in Al-Ghabawi landfill, the only sanitary\nlandfill in Jordan, while most of the remaining waste\nis dumped into well controlled dumpsites. Open\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n91\ndumping of solid waste accounts for not more than\n5% of all solid waste generated. According to the\nSweep Net Report of 2010 and 2014, the rate of\nsolid waste generation in Jordan is 0.9 kg/day per\ncapita, with a 90% collection coverage in urban\nareas compared with 70% in rural areas. Only 10%\nof collected waste is recycled, while the remaining\n90% is dumped in landfills. Although there are 18\nworking landfills in Jordan, Al-Ghabawi and AlEkader landills are by far the largest, receiving more\nthat 60% of all waste sent to landfills. A sanitary cell\nis planned to be constructed in Al-Ekader landfill\nin 2017. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs plans to\ndecrease the number of landfill sites and shift the\nload to transfer stations that will in turn convey\ncompacted waste to central landfills.\nDifferent laws and regulations govern solid waste\nmanagement and handling. Municipalities’ law\nNo. 13/2011 assigns the responsibility of waste\ncollection to municipalities, while the general\nframework law of waste management, under\ndevelopment by the Ministry of Environment,\nseeks to provide general guidance for waste\nmanagement. Public health law No. 47/2008 seeks\nto prevent nuisances resulting from illegal and\ninappropriate dumping.\nLiquid waste in Jordan is divided into domestic\nand industrial wastewater. Domestic wastewater\nis collected by sewerage networks and tankers\nand transported to wastewater treatment plants,\nwhich are mostly operated by the Water Authority\nof Jordan with a few plants operated by the private\nsector through agreements with the Ministry of\nWater and Irrigation. Reclaimed wastewater is\nconsidered as a water source, according to the\nJordan water strategy. Treated wastewater is\nused primarily to supplement clean water for\nirrigation purposes. According to the Ministry of\nWater and Irrigation, 14377 dunum of agricultural\nland was irrigated with treated wastewater in\n2014. The practice of using treated wastewater\nfor industrial purposes is limited to the city of\nAqaba. In 2007, treated domestic wastewater\nwas 87 MCM accounting for 10.3% of the water\nbudget, while treated industrial wastewater was\n4 MCM accounting for 1.3%. In 2022, treated\ndomestic wastewater is predicted to reach 220\nMCM accounting for 13.3% of the water budget,\nwhile treated industrial treated wastewater is\nexpected to reach 27 MCM accounting for 2.3%\nof the water budget.\nAs of 2016, there were 33 working wastewater\ntreatment plants (WWTP) in Jordan. Samra is the\nlargest wastewater treatment plant treating more\nthan 70% of all generated wastewater. Anaerobic\ndigestion is used at Samra to treat biosolids,\ngenerating methane gas which is then combusted\nfor electricity production. Other wastewater\ntreatment plants plan to utilize biosolids for\nelectricity production.\nDifferent laws, regulations, and instructions\ngovern the wastewater treatment sector in Jordan.\nSewerage system regulation No. 66/1994 regulates\nconnections to the sewer network. Treated\nwastewater must comply with JS 893/2006.\nMinistry of Agriculture according to agriculture law\nhas set the instructions no 4/2004 to use treated\nwastewater for irrigation.\nMost of the industries in Jordan are small and\nmedium enterprises (SMEs). They are located\nwithin Industrial Estates, Qualified Industrial Zones\nor located separately. The Amman-Zarqa region\nis the largest urban center, where the majority of\nJordanian industry is concentrated. According to\nMWI figures, the ratio of industrial to total water\nuse in 2013 was very small (4.3%). Industrial\nwastewater is usually pre-treated at on-site units\nbefore being discharged to the central wastewater\ntreatment plant within the industrial estate for\nfurther treatment or to locations to be used for\ntrees irrigation or to nearby Wadis. Many industrial\nentities (e.g., food industries) generate wastewater\nthat complies with the connection requirements\nto the sewerage network, and therefore, divert\ntheir wastewater to the public sewer system. It\nis assumed that aerobic treatment is used at the\nindustrial estates’ wastewater treatment plants,\nwhich results in negligible GHG emissions.\nThe waste sector has been reviewed and the\nbaseline scenario updated taking into account\nthe following:\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n92\nn\nn In line with Jordan water strategy, all possible\ncubic meter of wastewater is to be treated to\nreplace fresh water in agricultural purposes.\nn\nn Current wastewater treatment plants will\nregularly be modified to account for increased\ngeneration of domestic wastewater driven by\npopulation growth. However, expansion will\nprimarily take place at plants that serve urban\nareas.\nn\nn Current water consumption and generated\nwastewater per capita is assumed to be fixed.\nn\nn All future needed WWTPs will be mechanical\nwith activated sludge method of operation.\nn\nn Biogas utilization from the digestion of\nsludge is mainly practiced at the Samra plant.\nHowever, other plants, such as Shalalah, have\nstarted to utilize biogas and other plants are\nplanning to do so in the future.\nn\nn Most of the sludge produced from other\ntreatment plants will be dried and disposed\nof in landfill sites.\nn\nn Solid waste production rate per capita is\nassumed to be fixed at 0.9 kg/capita/day.\nn\nn Protein consumption per capita is fixed at 29.6\nkg/capita/year.\nn\nn Factories and industrial plants are located\nwithin industrial cities or outside of them.\nAll plants located within the industrial cities\nare connected to central well managed\naerobic wastewater treatment plants. Plants\nlocated outside the industrial cities are mostly\nconnected to domestic wastewater plants in\naccordance with Water Authority regulations.\nTables A.13-A.16 in Appendix A show actual and\nprojected generated amounts of domestic solid\nwaste (2010-2040), quantities of wastewater\ndischarged to WWTPs (2010-2015), and influent\norganic load to WWTPs in 2015.\n3.5 GHG Emissions in Baseline\nScenario for Different Sectors\n3.5.1 GHG emissions from the energy\nsector\nThis section presents the energy sector’s GHG\nemissions profile in the baseline scenario as\ngenerated by the LEAP model. GHG emissions\nby the energy sector in the baseline scenario\nare shown in Table A.17 in Appendix A. The data\nindicates that the energy sector is the primary\nsource of GHG emissions in Jordan accounting\nfor 81% and 84% of all emissions in 2010 and\n2012, respectively, according to the 2010 and\n2012 GHG Inventory. The role of the energy sector\nand subsectors as the leading emitter of GHGs is\nexpected to continue in the future. However, it\nis expected that the sector’s share will decline to\n69% of all emissions in 2040 due to the assumed\nintroduction of nuclear power as well as the\ninclusion of more renewable energy sources in\nthe total energy mix. Therefore, the energy sector\nwill be the focus of mitigation efforts.\nThe most significant GHG sources in energy\ndemand and supply sector are in order; electricity\ngeneration, transportation, industrial, residential\nand commercial. As shown in Figure (3.7) in 2015,\nenergy sector GHG emissions reached 25.71\nmillion metric Tons (Mt) CO2eq.\nEmissions will increase at an average rate of 1.1%\nannually between 2015 and 2040 and reach a total\nof 31.42 M tons of CO2eq in 2040, compared with\n25.71 M tons of CO2eq in 2015.\nTable 3.11 shows the total GHG emissions from\nthe energy demand and supply sector in the\nbaseline scenario in selected years. Figure 3.8\nshows a graphical representation of those same\nemissions during the period 2012-2040.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n93\nFigure 3.7: Share (%) of GHG emissions by energy subsector, 2015\nTable 3.11: Total GHG emissions (Million tons of CO2eq) from energy demand and supply in the\nbaseline scenario for selected years\nBaseline scenario\n2013\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nEmissions\n24.23\n25.71\n26.90\n22.61\n27.96\n29.05\n31.42\nFigure 3.8: Total GHG emissions (Million Tons of CO2eq) from energy demand and supply in the\nbaseline scenario, 2013-2040\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n94\nThe GHG emissions from various energy demand\nand supply subsectors are described below:\n-\tThe most significant change in sectoral\ncontribution is in the power sector where\nemissions will decline at an average annual\nrate of 1.6% attributed to the introduction\nof a 2000 MW nuclear power plant, and\nthe increasing share of renewable sources\nin electricity generation, and the shift to\nincreased use of natural gas, which is less\ncarbon intensive than oil products, fuel oil,\nand diesel, even when taking into account\nthe increased use of oil shale.\n-\tThe transportation sector’s GHG emissions\nwill grow at an average annual rate of 1.2%\nduring the period 2015-2040. The emissions\nwill increase to 11.69 M Tons of CO2eq in 2040,\ncompared to 8.62 M Tons of CO2eq and 10.7 M\nTons of CO2eq in 2015 and 2020, respectively.\nThis is mostly attributed to an increase in fleet\nsize and to growth in transportation services.\n-\tIndustrial GHG emissions will grow at a high\naverage rate of 4.5% annually in the period\n2015-2040, reaching to 7.03 M Tons of\nCO2eq in 2040 compared with 2.34 M Tons\nof CO2eq in 2015. The growth in emissions\nis due to a more developed sector and to\ngovernment policies designed to increase\nthe contribution of value-adding industrial\ngrowth opportunities to GDP.\n-\tThe share of GHG emissions from the residential\nsector will increase slightly from 5% (1.52 M\nTons of CO2eq) in 2015 to 6% (1.73 M Tons of\nCO2eq) in 2020 and to 6.2% (2.16 M Tons of\nCO2eq) in 2040.\nTable 3.12 and Figure 3.9 show the sectoral GHG\nemissions from energy demand and supply in\nthe baseline scenario for selected years. Table\n3.13 shows the emissions by greenhouse gas in\nthe energy baseline scenario for selected years.\nCarbon dioxide dominates other GHGs in the\nenergy sector, a trend expected to continue over\nmany years.\nTable 3.12: GHG emissions (Million tons of CO2eq) from energy demand and supply subsectors\nin the baseline scenario in selected years\nBranches\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nDemand\n13.30\n15.48\n17.79\n20.15\n22.07\n23.31\nIndustrial\n2.34\n3.09\n4.07\n5.18\n6.22\n7.03\nResidential\n1.52\n1.73\n1.91\n2.04\n2.13\n2.16\nServices\n0.35\n0.46\n0.61\n0.77\n0.93\n1.05\nTransport\n8.62\n9.60\n10.41\n11.13\n11.58\n11.69\nOthers\n0.46\n0.61\n0.80\n1.02\n1.22\n1.38\nTransformation\n12.41\n11.42\n4.82\n7.81\n6.97\n8.11\nElectricity generation\n12.41\n11.42\n4.82\n7.80\n6.97\n8.11\nTotal\n25.71\n26.90\n22.61\n27.96\n29.04\n31.42\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n95\nFigure 3.9: GHG emissions (Million tons of CO2eq) by energy subsector in the baseline scenario\nfor selected years\n3.5.2 GHG emissions from the IPPU sector\nThe IPPU sector contributed 9% and 12% in 2010 and 2012, respectively, to the overall GHG emissions\nin Jordan, ranking in second place after the energy sector. It is expected to contribute 5890 Gg of CO2eq\nin 2040, accounting for 13% of all GHG emissions. The cement industry is the main contributor to the\nIPPU sector’s GHG emissions. Other contributors include the production and use of lime, limestone,\nsoda ash, and nitric acid. Baseline emissions from the IPPU sector during the period 2015-2040 are\nlisted in Table A.21 of Appendix A.

It\nis projected to contribute 3180 Gg of CO2eq in\n2040, accounting for 7% of all GHG emissions.\nThe main contributor to AFOLU emissions is the\nlivestock subsector. Baseline emissions from the\nAFOLU sector for the period 2015-2040 are listed\nin Table A.19 of Appendix A. Table 3.15 shows the\ntotal GHG emissions from the AFOLU sector in\nthe baseline scenario by gas in selected years. For\nthe AFOLU sector, the baseline scenario (the net\nemissions sources and sinks) was estimated using\nthe same categories in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines.\nTable 3.15: GHG emissions (Gg of CO2eq) by gas in the AFOLU baseline scenario for selected\nyears\nYear\nCH4 emissions\nfrom livestock\nN2O emissions from\nmanaged soils\nNet CO2 emissions\nfrom land\nTotal CO2eq\nGg of CO2eq\n2015\n27.89\n0.020\n-197.73\n394.10\n2020\n39.12\n0.028\n-137.58\n692.52\n2025\n54.87\n0.039\n-95.7\n1068.52\n2030\n76.96\n0.054\n-66.58\n1566.30\n2035\n107.94\n0.076\n-46.32\n2243.88\n2040\n151.39\n0.106\n-32.22\n3179.9\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n97\n3.5.4 GHG emissions from the waste\nsector\nThe waste sector is the third largest contributor\nto GHG emissions in Jordan according to the 2010\nand 2012 GHG Inventory, accounting for 7% and\n6% of all GHG emissions, respectively. Solid waste\ncontributes the most emissions. The waste sector\ncontribution is expected to increase to 5070 Gg\nof CO2eq in 2040, accounting for a share of 11%\nof the total GHG emissions.\nAs AsSamra WWTP (the largest in Jordan)\nconverted its operation from natural treatment\nmethod (partly anaerobic) to aerobic mode,\nthe emissions of methane were considered to\nbe negligible. Baseline emissions for the waste\nsector for the period 2015-2040 are listed in Table\nA.20 of Appendix A. Table 3.16 below provides a\nsummary for selected years.\n3.5.5 Overall GHG emissions in the\nbaseline scenario\nJordan’s anthropogenic emissions by sources, and\nremovals by sinks, of all GHGs in 2010 and 2012\nwere 23140 Gg of CO2eq and 27998 Gg of CO2eq,\nrespectively. These emissions are expected to grow\naccording to the baseline scenario to 34330 Gg\nof CO2eq, 31450 Gg of CO2eq, 38180 Gg of CO2eq,\nand 45560 Gg of CO2eq in 2020, 2025, 2030, and\n2040, respectively.\nTable 3.17 shows the total GHG emissions in the\nbaseline scenario for selected years in Jordan.\nFigure 3.10 and Table A.21 of Appendix A illustrate\nthe overall GHG emissions in the baseline scenario\nand those of the emitting sectors of energy,\nindustrial processes, waste, and AFOLU.

The cost-benefit analysis and the\nCO2 emissions reduction have been updated for\neach proposed mitigation project. Additional GHG\nmitigation measures have also been identified,\nanalyzed, and added to the list of the updated\nmitigation measures. Net present value was used\nin the financial calculations, by converting all\npresent and future revenues and costs over the\nlifetime of the project to a base of today’s cost.\nThe same approach was followed in calculating\nCO2 emissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nproposed projects. A discount rate of 8% was\nused in all calculations. The discounted unit\ncost of reduced emissions is the quotient of\nthe discounted net cash flow to the discounted\nemissions reduction.\nThe LEAP software model was used to perform\nthe energy mitigation analysis, while analysis of\nnon-energy sectors was conducted separately\nand then merged with the energy analysis in\nthe LEAP model to generate the overall national\nscenario. The impact of the mitigation options was\nassessed versus the baseline scenario. The updated\nmitigation scenario includes 39 GHG mitigation\nprojects in the following areas:\nn\nn Primary energy;\nn\nn Renewable energy;\nn\nn Energy efficiency;\nn\nn Industrial processes;\nn\nn Waste; and\nn\nn Agriculture and forestry.\nThe results of the mitigation analysis are presented\nin the following sub-sections.\n3.6.1 Mitigation options for primary\nenergy\n3.6.1.1 Updates on the TNC projects\nThe GHG mitigation options in the primary energy\ndemand and supply that were considered in the\nTNC report have been reviewed and assessed.

The duration\nof the project is 6 years and will be implemented\ngradually. The main components of the project will\nbe optimizing the utilization of distribution and\ngeneration, improving the system power factor,\nand upgrading or replacing existing conductors\nand insulators with lower-resistance equipment.\nThe cost is estimated to be USD 275 per KW. This\nproject can lead to a significant reduction in fuel\nconsumption and eliminate 8435 thousand tons\nof CO2eq discounted emissions over the next 23\nyears.\nn\nn Natural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa, and Aqaba (TNC updated and modified\nproject)\nThe natural gas needed for the electricity\ngeneration during the period 2016-2022 is\nestimated to be 350-420 MMcfd, while in the\nperiod 2023-2025 the quantity will be decreased\nto 150-250 MMcfd due to the oil shale and nuclear\npower plant projects. The demand of the industrial\nsector for natural gas is estimated to be 150\nMMcfd while the demand of the residential and\ntransportation will be around 90 MMcfd in the\nsame period.\nAccording to the energy strategy 2015-2025,\nJordan will enhance the usage of Natural Gas\nin all sectors such as the Industrial, Residential,\nCommercial and Transportation.\nIn 2016, 90% of the electricity generation of the\nKingdom based on natural gas imported via\nterminals.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n102\nTo deliver natural gas to smaller customers it\nwill be necessary to construct new low-pressure\ngas distribution in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\nnetworks and to connect customers to the\nnew infrastructure. Investments required in this\nindustry are large. The duration of this project\nwill be for 10 years, starting in 2020 and will be\nexecuted gradually with a capital cost of USD 110\nmillion.\nNatural gas combustion emits 1.2 times less CO2\nthan that of oil, which indicates that using natural\ngas in demand side sector as an alternative for\ndiesel, fuel oil, LPG and gasoline will reduce a\nsignificant quantity of CO2 emissions. Using the\nnatural gas in distributing network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba will reduce about 3442 thousand\ntons of CO2eq discounted emissions in the next\n20 years.\nn\nn Demand Side Management -DSM (TNC\nupdated\nproject)\nDSM includes any actions implemented to reduce\nthe contribution to system peak load or reduce\noverall energy consumption. The basic objective\nof DSM is to reduce costs (operating and capital\ncosts) through improving efficiency of end\nuses of electricity or modifying their electricity\nconsumption pattern which save the equivalent\nof adding annually 100 MW to the system. The\nduration of the project is about five years starting\nin 2018. This project will be very efficient and can\nlead to significant reduction in CO2 emissions\nwhich account to 2842 thousand tons CO2 discount\nemissions through the next 22 years.\nn\nn Adding a 100 MW Combined cycle in Samra\nPower Plant (newly identified project)\nIt is suggested to convert two gas turbines into\ncombined cycle power plant by adding 100 MW\nsteam turbine, in this configuration, a natural\ngas is burned to operate the two-gas turbine\nto generate electricity. The hot turbine exhaust\ngasses are passed through a steam boiler to\nproduce steam to feed steam turbine. The steam\nturbine utilizes waste heat from the turbine that,\nin a simple cycle would have been rejected to\nthe atmosphere. This project will add 100 MW\nto the plant capacity without any extra cost for\nadditional fuel. The additional electricity increases\nthe overall system efficiency. It is suggested that\nthe project be implement in 2018, 2019, with a\ntotal cost of USD 80 million. The estimated CO2\nemission reduction is 3564 thousand tons CO2eq\n(discounted emissions) through 21 years from\n2019-2040.\nThe costs and CO2 emissions reduction for the four\nproposed projects have been analyzed.

All these\nfluorescent tubes have conventional ballasts.\nReplacing these units with (18X4) LED fixtures\nwill result in 60 Watts saving in each fixture.\nThe Government of Jordan represented by the\nMEMR and particularly JREEEF will initiate this\nprocess and distribute 100 000 LED lamps.\nn\nn Insulating Walls and Roofs In 35 Thousand\nHouses (TNC updated Project)\nThis proposed project will be implemented\ngradually starting from 2018 up to 2040,\nwith 8.53 kton CO2eq as average rate of GHGs\nreduction annually.\nn\nn Street Lighting: Replacing 125 W Mercury\nlamps with 70 W high Pressure Sodium lamps\n(TNC updated Project)\nIn street lighting, it is suggested to replace\n200,000 lamps that are now of Mercury type\nwith lamps of High Pressure Sodium (HPS).\nn\nn Using Regenerative Burners Instead Of\nConventional Burners in Steel Reheating\nIndustry (TNC updated Project)\nThis proposed project will be implemented\ngradually starting from 2018 up to 2040, with\n7.47 kton CO2 eq as average rate of GHGs\nreduction annually.\nn\nn Using variable speed drives in the pumps (TNC\nupdated project)\nThis proposed project will be implemented\ngradually starting from 2019 up to 2040, with\n8.53 kton CO2 eq as average rate of GHGs\nreduction annually.\nn\nn LED Lighting in Public Buildings (Newly\nidentified project)\nThis measure intends to distribute 10-watt\nTube- 35000 LED Lamps in public buildings.\nThe LED lamps will replace the existing 4x18\nwatt fluorescent lamps. By distributing these\nlamps, it is estimated that energy savings will\nbe more than 40% of the fluorescent lighting\nconsumption. Every 18-watt fluorescent lamp\nwill be replaced by 10-watt LED lamp.\nn\nn Improving Energy Efficiency in Small and\nMedium Hotels (newly identified project)\nThe program that will be initiated by JREEEF\naims at improving energy efficiency in small\nand medium existing hotels in Jordan. The\nowners of these hotels have limited internal\nfunds to invest in EE projects and poor access\nto commercial financing and lack of knowledge\nand awareness of the available technologies.\nThe program will consist of financial and\ntechnical support, combined with awareness\nand communication campaigns to undertake\nappropriate energy efficient measures in this\ncategory of hotels. All energy efficiency measure\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n107\ncan be eligible, including envelope insulation,\nimprovement of air conditioning and heating\nequipment, efficient lighting, etc. The program\ncan target 100 to 120 small and medium hotels\nthroughout Jordan. The program will lead to an\nannual energy savings of 10,000,000 KWh with\na reduction in emissions of around 5.8 kt CO2\nn\nn LED Lighting in Households (newly identified\nproject)\nThis measurer intends to distribute 150 000 E27LED Lamps for residential sector (specifically\nfor low consumption households class (< 600\nKWh/month).

Table 3.24 is a summary of their status. All TNC projects are now considered\nas part of the baseline scenario. No new projects have been suggested in this FBUR because of the\nlack of expertise in this sector at the national level as well as the lack of clarity in responsibilities and\nmandates among different acting institutions within the sector.\nTable 3.24 Status of mitigation projects in the transportation sector\nProject Name\nStatus\nReduction by using hybrid cars for\npublic passengers\nMoved from the TNC mitigation scenario and\nconsidered as part of the current BUR baseline scenario\nReduction by Amman – Zarqa Bus\nRapid Transit (BRT)\nMoved from the TNC mitigation scenario and\nconsidered as part of the current BUR baseline scenario\n3.6.5 Mitigation options in the IPPU sector\n3.6.5.1 Updates on the TNC projects\nGHG mitigation options in the IPPU sector that were considered in the TNC report have been reviewed\nand assessed. Relevant information is presented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.25. Table\n3.25 is a summary of their status.\nTable 3.25: Status of the IPPU mitigation projects\nProject Name\nStatus,\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw\nmaterials needed to produce clinker\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\ncement\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45% of\nPozzolana\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario\nUse of biomass (MSW or/and Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario\nCatalytic Reduction of N2O inside the Ammonia\nBurner of the Nitric Acid Plant\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n109\n3.6.5.2 Mitigation scenario for the\nIPPU sector up to 2040\nUpdated and valid projects from the TNC in the\nIPPU sector are briefly described below.\nn\nn Use of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute\nthe raw materials needed to produce clinker\nat the selected cement plant (TNC updated\nproject)\nCertain steel slag and fly ash materials (decarbonated kiln feedstocks) could be added to\nthe raw material feed to reduce the amount of raw\nmaterial needed to produce a given amount of\nclinker. Jordan has more than 5 steel melting and\ngalvanizing factories, therefore; there is available\nstock of steel slag and fly ash to be used in cement\nindustry.\nIn this mitigation project, it is suggested to\nproduce new type of cement CEM V (Composite\nCement) at one of the cement industries; mainly\nthe one that has a neighbor steel manufacturing\ncompany and can try the production of such\ntype of cement with minor additional costs in\ncomparison to other existing companies. The\npercentages of blast-furnace slag and natural\npozzolana ranges between 31-49% per each to\nproduce CEM V/B. Accordingly, a 40% substitution\nof steel slag/fly ash and a 10% production of new\nCEM V/B will be assumed at this company.\nThe price of steel slag and/or fly ash is estimated\nto be 23.1 JD/ton available cost of 25-40 USD/\nton). The cost of energy and raw materials reach\n61% of total cost and based on the assumption of\nproduction cost of 49 JD/ton cement, this option\nwill reduce the cost by 29.9 JD/ton cement. No\nannual increase in the production costs will be\nassumed for the period (2018 – 2040). Investment\ncost to grind the steel slag will be estimated as\n911,564 JD (based on the maximum produced\ntons of CEM II in 2040) based on the estimated\ncost of 0.75 USD/ton cement.\nn\nn Increase the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM\nII (TNC updated project)\nBlended cement is a mixture of clinker and\nadditives containing less than 95% clinker. Blended\ncement types are distinct products with different\nuses that have different additives and different\nshares of clinker. More than 90% of cement\nproduced at the local cement companies is CEM\nII (Portland–Pozzolana Cement) with a percentage\nof Pozzolana ranges between 21-32%. Therefore;\nthere is an area to increase the percentage of\nPozzolana in CEM II by improving the reactivity of\nthe produced clinker and the raw mix to produce\nCEM II/B-P to achieve the required strength of\n42.5N that cause the use of Pozzolana of less than\n32% (the 3% is substituted by gypsum). Based\non the provided data from one of the Cement\nCompanies, the average percentage of Pozzolana\nin CEM II is around 32% (65% clinker as per the\nfollowing information and calculations and 3%\nGypsum), so this option is not required to be\nimplemented for this company. A reasonable 2%\nmore substitution could be assumed on average\nand so a reduction of CO2 emissions by 2% could\nbe assumed as well.\nSince all local cement companies produce CEM\nII, there is no need for investment to construct\nthe equipment needed to receive, store, grind\nand meter Pozzolana to the cement product. The\noperational cost includes the price of extraction\nto Natural Resources Authority (NRA) and\ntransportation. However; this option will reduce\nthe cost of raw materials (mainly limestone) and\nenergy needed to produce the saved clinker that\nwill be substituted by Pozzolana. To have time\nfor the experimental trials, it is expected to start\nthe implementation of such project in 2018. The\nproject lifetime will be as the lifetime of Cement\nPlants which expected to be more than 50 years.\nThe price of pozzolana is estimated to be 20 JD/\nton. And as mentioned above, this option will\nreduce the cost by 29.9 JD/ton cement to save\nboth energy and raw materials and no extra\ninvestment cost is needed.\nn\nn Produce new cement product CEM IV with\n45% of Pozzolana (TNC updated project)\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n110\nIt is estimated that 10% of currently produced\nCEM II/B-P will be changed to CEM IV, strength\n22.5X in which the Pozzolana substitution will\nreach 45% (more by at least 13% (=45-32)). CO2\nreduction will be calculated by multiplying the\nannual CO2 emissions by the reduced percentage\nof 13% regarding that for our case this percentage\nwill be also multiplied by the percentage of the\nproducts that will be converted from CEM II/B-P\nto CEM IV which is assumed to be 10% of CEM\nII/B-P. Therefore; annual CO2 emissions from\nproducing CEM II/B-P will be multiplied by 1.3%\nto calculate the CO2 emissions reduction because\nof implementing this option.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, marketing\nthe new product, set the legally binding\nregulations and enforcement measures to control\nits use, it is expected to start the implementation\nof such project in 2018. The project lifetime will be\nas the lifetime of Cement Plants which expected\nto be more than 50 years. The price of pozzolana\nis estimated to be 20 JD/ton. And as mentioned\nabove, this option will reduce the cost by 29.9 JD/\nton cement to save both energy and raw materials\nand no extra investment cost is needed.\nn\nn Use of biomass (MSW or/and Sewage Sludge)\nas alternative fuels (TNC updated project)\nA potential reduction of CO2 emissions in cement\nindustry could be achieved by switching from a\ntraditional fossil fuel to a biomass fuel which is\nbased on the specific emission factor for the fuel\nas related to its calorific value and carbon content.\nMost organic materials have a calorific value of 9-16\nGJ/ton cement, while the main firing of a cement\nkiln requires at least 18-20 GJ/ton cement. Therefore;\nbiomass shall be blended with other fuels.\nSince most of local cement factories are licensed\nto burn coal, petcoke and alternative fuels such\nas waste tires, oil shale and used oil to replace\nthe expensive heavy fuel oil, they are equipped\nwith multi-purpose burners which reduce the\ninvestment costs for using biomass as alternative\nfuels. However, the required capital cost depends\non the needed storage, segregation, handling,\ngrinding and metering as well as environmental\npollution control measures.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, studies\nof the maximum percentage of MSW and dried\nsewage sludge to be used, availability of stocks\nat market, testing the emissions, conduct EIA\nstudy and get the environmental clearance; it\nis expected to start the implementation of such\nproject in 2018. The project lifetime will be as the\nlifetime of Cement Plants which expected to be\nmore than 50 years.\nn\nn Catalytic reduction of n2o inside the ammonia\nburner of the nitric acid plant (TNC updated\nproject)\nThe project activity involves the installation\nof a new N2O abatement technology that is\nnot commonly used in nitric acid plants. The\nabatement technology is a pelleted catalyst\nthat will be installed inside the ammonia burner\njust underneath the precious metal gauzes. This\ntechnology is capable to reduce approximately\n75% to 80% of the N2O formed at the precious\nmetal gauzes inside the ammonia burner to\natmospheric N2 and O2.\nThe precious metal gauzes suffer a continuous\nloss of metal therefore; they are replaced during\nspecific period known as campaign. The average\nproduction per campaign is 30,000 tons of\n100% nitric acid). The selected N2O abatement\ntechnology depends on replacing some of Al2O3\nballs that support the platinum-rhodium catalyst\nby base metal secondary catalyst, which is capable\nof reducing N2O by at least 75%.\nThere are no economic benefits, enforcement\nregulations or pollution abatement benefits of\nimplementing such project, it only aims at reducing\nthe GHG emissions, therefore; its implementation\nstrongly depends on having economic incentives.\nThe project is assumed to start in 2018 and its\nlifetime is estimated to be same as the lifetime\nof KEMAPCO plant which is estimated to be 25\nyears (till the year 2040).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed IPPU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed.

A review of those articles on\naverage they were as follows:\nGreater Amman municipality estimated a loss of\n2100 pine and coniferous trees from public parks.\nJordan University estimated a loss of 1000 trees.\nRoyal Scientific Society estimated a loss of 400\ntrees.\nTotal number of trees suggested by the project=\n3500 medium size coniferous trees.\nA medium growth coniferous tree, planted in an\nurban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years,\nsequesters 0.039-ton CO2 per planted tree.\nn\nn Forestry- Introduce new plantations in\nNorthern\nArea\nNo formal estimations were published for\nthe losses in trees, but numbers in the local\nnewspapers on average declared losses from\nAjloun and Jerash were 26 000 trees.\n26 000 trees will be planted over five years\n10 000 Jerash è 2000 tree per year\n16 000 Ajloun è 4000 first year and then 3000\ntrees per year\nn\nn Rangelands Project 1: Restoration of\nRangeland\nAreas\nJordan natural rangelands play an important role\nin covering the livestock feed requirements. In\nspite of the damage, they sustained during the\npast five decades the livestock feed. They cover\nfeed requirements for a period of 2- 3 months\nwithout complimentary feeding or 30% of food\nrequirements. The productivity of rangelands is\nhighly dependent on rainfall, topography and soil.\nFeed unit productivity of rangelands is estimated\nat 40 kilograms of dry feed matter per dunum in\nareas with 100-200 mm of annual rainfall; and 100\nkilograms per dunum in the areas that receive\nmore than 200 mm. The Project suggest planting\nrangelands with perennial fodder shrubs in the\nBadia (AlJafr and AlHusseinieh) sub-districts within\nthe Ma’an Governorate.\nn\nn Rangelands Project 2: New Protected\nRangeland Area as Natural Reserve\nThe total area of natural grazing land in the Desert\n(Badia) is approximately 70 million dunum which\nare concentrated in the area that receives less than\n100 mm/year rainfall as short thundershowers\nand rainfall amounts decrease towards the east\nand the south till it reaches 50 mm/year or even\nless. Of these 70 million dunum only 1 million\ndunum is considered as natural reserves. The\nproject suggests increasing the protected area\nby another 100 000 dunum namely in the wide\ndesert valleys south Badia. The project will harness\ndirect benefit for protection of floral biodiversity\nthrough controlling the grazing of the indigenous\nAtriplex halimus shrubs. Much of this area is\ncovered with chert and an underlying thin layer\nof fine textured soil. \nArtemisia herba- alba, Retama raetam, Achillea\nfragrantissima,\nAtriplex\nhalimus and Poa\nbulbosa are common in the wadi beds. Despite\nits deterioration this region is known to be the\nmain grazing land in Jordan. The project will\nachieve reductions through CO2 emissions\noffset from natural soil carbon release caused\nby rangeland deterioration. The project will\nharness direct benefit for soil resources through\nrain harvest techniques as well as soil erosion\ncontrol techniques (erosion is caused from flash\nfloods flow).\nThe average annual dry matter production is 4\nkg/dunum in normal years and when protected\ncan be increased to 15 kg/dunum in the range\nreserves.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n113\nIt is assumed to have an average of 35 average\nsized shrub/dunum and the sequestration rate\nis 4 g SOC/m2/year. A lifetime of 15 years will be\nassumed for calculations purposes.\nn\nn Promoting for Climate-smart agricultural\npractices in the Jordan Valley\nClimate smart agriculture is not a new agricultural\nsystem, nor is it a set of practices. It is a new\napproach, a way to guide the needed changes\nof agricultural systems, given the necessity\nto jointly address food security and climate\nchange. It contributes to the achievement of\nsustainable development goals and integrates\nthe three dimensions of sustainable development\n(economic, social and environmental) by jointly\naddressing food security and climate challenges.\nIt is composed of three main pillars: Sustainably\nincreasing agricultural productivity and incomes;\nadapting and building resilience to climate\nchange; reducing and/or removing greenhouse\ngases emissions, where possible.\nSustainable crop production, controlled grazing\nand maintained forest systems can sequester\nsubstantial and variable amounts of carbon\nfrom the atmosphere and store it in soils and\nvegetation. Carbon sequestration will not only\nstabilize climate but will also make agricultural\nincrease the overall resilience of the agroecosystems. Widespread adoption of climate-\nsmart practices has the potential to make major\ncontributions to the achievement of national food\nsecurity and development goals.

The five proposed projects aim\nat generating biogas from the sludge and\nconnecting the generated electricity to the\nnational electricity grid. These projects will\ncontribute in reducing the amount of fuel used\nfor the electricity generation.\nThe following assumptions were used during the\nupdate of waste projects:\nn\nn The starting year for implementing the\nproposed projects is 2018.\nn\nn Construction activities, commissioning, and\ntesting will take 1 year (the actual operation\nfor the proposed projects will be in 2019).\nn\nn Density of methane is 0.717 kg/m3.\nn\nn The captured methane from all landfills\nis calculated according to the PRIF study\n(Environment and use of methane from\nmunicipal waste in Amman, 1993), where\nthe average value is used.\nn\nn Electricity-specific emission factors for grid\nelectricity kgCO2/KW adopted from www.\necometric.com\nn\nn The calculation of generated electricity in MW\nis based on 8,000 working hours per year.\nn\nn The generated electricity will be sold at a fixed\nprice of 0.06 JD/kWh.\nn\nn The cost of a 1 MW biogas electricity\ngeneration system (generator, wells, piping,\netc.) is 1,500,000 JD, according to the\nInternational Renewable Energy Agency\n(ARENA).\nn\nn The fixed annual cost is the sum of\nmaintenance, operation, overhead, and\nsupervision costs (10% of capital investment,\naccording to ARENA).\nAll mitigation options under the waste sector\nwere considered as energy measures because the\nbiogas will be used for electric power generation.\nThe cost and the CO2 emission reduction are\nanalyzed for the 9 proposed projects.

Reporting and verification\nare important for ensuring transparency, good\ngovernance, accountability, and credibility of\nresults, and for building confidence that resources\nare being utilized effectively.\nThis chapter is prepared as part of Jordan’s\nfirst Biennial Update Report to the UNFCCC. It\naddresses three types of MRV, namely:\nn\nn MRV of GHG emissions, conducted at national\nlevel to understand the emissions profile and\nreport it in the form of emissions inventory.\nn\nn MRV of mitigation actions (e.g., policies and\nprojects) to assess GHG mitigation efforts as\nwell as monitor their implementation.\nn\nn MRV of support (e.g., climate finance,\ntechnology transfer, and capacity building) to\ntrack provision and receipt of climate support.\nThis chapter also seeks to describe the current\nstatus of GHG inventory estimation and reporting\nas well as of GHG mitigation. It will also suggest\nan integrated national MRV system for climate\nchange action.\nThe main objective of UNFCCC is to “achieve\nstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations\nin the atmosphere at a level that would prevent\ndangerous anthropogenic interference with the\nclimate system.” The UNFCCC requests reporting\ninformation from countries to have a better\nunderstanding and tracking the progress with\ncommitments or pledges, providing confidence\nand enhancing accountability in quantified\ninformation measured and reported, and\nproviding background information on the scope\nand ambition of national climate responses.\nUNFCCC requirements and IPCC guidance on\nMRV leave considerable flexibility for countries\nto decide how to meet reporting requirements.\nThe IPCC Guidelines also set out methodological\noptions that provide countries with flexibility. This\nflexibility has strong advantages for countries,\nbut it can also affect the quality and details of\nreporting.\nParties to the UNFCCC are obliged to communicate\nto the Conference of the Parties (COP), through the\nSecretariat, information on the actions they have\ntaken or envisage they will take to implement the\nConvention. This is seen as a key implementation\naspect of the Convention, as it allows Parties to\ninform one another of their national level actions\nand serves as a basis for the COP to assess the\nimplementation of the Convention by Parties. The\nreporting provisions contained in the Convention\nwere further enhanced through the Bali Action\nPlan adopted at COP 13 in 2007. The Bali Action\nPlan introduced the principle of MRV for both\ndeveloped and developing country Parties in the\ncontext of enhancing action at the international\nand national level to mitigate climate change.\nThis principle was further elaborated through a\nnumber of subsequent COP decisions, resulting\nin a comprehensive MRV framework under the\nConvention.\nThe Paris Agreement adds the obligation to\nprepare, communicate, and maintain successive\nNDCs and to pursue mitigation actions aligned\nwith these contributions. Key reporting provisions\nof the Paris Agreement are that all Parties shall\nregularly submit national inventory reports and\ninformation on implementation and achievement\nof NDCs, and all Parties shall account for their NDCs.\nThe Paris Agreement also proposes an Enhanced\nTransparency Framework (ETF) as a system for\nMRV of climate action and support. The purpose\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n125\nof the ETF is to provide a clear understanding of\nmitigation actions, track progress towards NDCs,\nand inform a global stocktake to be undertaken\nevery 5 years. The ETF will build on existing\ntransparency mechanisms under the UNFCCC, and\nspecific modalities, procedures, and guidelines\nare being developed for presentation at COP 24\n(2018).\nDeveloping countries mostly submit their\nnational GHG inventory reports through National\nCommunications (NCs) or Biennial Update\nReports (BURs). NCs are to be submitted every 4\nyears and BURs every 2 years, with flexibility for\ncountries based on capacities, data availability,\nand resources available for MRV. Inventory reports\nshould be compiled using methods set out in the\nIPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.\nInventory compilation should adhere to five\nprinciples: transparency, accuracy, completeness,\ncomparability, and consistency. The IPCC\nGuidelines also set out methodological options\nthat provide countries with flexibility. Countries\nshould report on mitigation actions as part of their\nBURs, giving information on methodologies “to\nthe extent possible”.\n4.2 Current Practices at the National\nLevel\nBased on the decisions adopted at COP 16 and 17\nas mentioned previously, non-Annex I Parties now\nneed to measure the specific effects of national\nmitigation actions as well as the support needed\nand received, and to provide this information,\nincluding a national inventory report, as part of\ntheir BURs. Therefore, introducing an MRV system\nin Jordan should be implemented based on the\ncountry’s national circumstances and national\npriorities and built on existing domestic systems\nand capacities while considering the international\nbest practices. It implies institutional improvements\naimed at coordination of all activities for the\ndevelopment of national communications and\nbiennial reports and will seek to define the\nresponsibilities of the authorized body.\n4.2.1 GHG inventories estimation\nThe current practices for the preparation of the\nnational GHG inventories are as follows:\nn\nn The GHG Inventory estimation is prepared\nonly for climate change reporting to the\nUNFCCC (National Communications and\nBURs).\nn\nn The process is not periodical on a set date. The\nactivity is only carried out to fulfil the country’s\ncommitment to UNFCCC Secretariat, and it\nis prepared through national efforts within\nprojects normally supported by GEF-UNDP.\nn\nn To this date, Jordan has prepared GHG national\ninventories for 1994, 2000, and 2006 as well as\nfor 2010 and 2012 as part of the current FBUR.\nn\nn Estimates for the earlier reports were\ndetermined using the Revised 1996 IPCC\nGuidelines, whereas for the current FBUR,\nGHG Inventories for 2010 and 2012 have been\nestimated using 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\nn\nn To this date, the collection of activity data for\nthe GHG Inventory estimation is carried out\nthrough a traditional method. A bottom-up\ndata collection approach is followed for all\nsectors and a top-down approach is followed\nfor the energy sector reference approach.\nn\nn Activity data collection is a long and tedious\nprocess and mostly requires internal personal\nconnections as well as the support of the\nmembers of the National Committee of\nClimate Change.\nn\nn For the activity data collection during each\nNational Communication process and the\ncurrent FBUR, formal letters were issued from\nthe Ministry of Environment (as project owner\nand UNFCCC focal point) to all sister Ministries\nand national stakeholders and institutions\nrequesting activity data. Tables were attached\nto the formal letters describing the needed\ndata and its format (Appendix B includes a list\nof the needed activity data that were used for\nJordan’s national GHG inventory estimation\nand their data sources (entities)).\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n126\nn\nn Follow-up visits were arranged by national\nexperts to ensure getting the needed activity\ndata.\nn\nn The data in most sectors are not readily\navailable in the IPCC format, and they are\noften scattered among multiple departments\nand organizations.\nn\nn At national organizations, data are mostly\nkept as paper copies that might be lost or\ndestroyed.\nn\nn National data for the AFOLU and Waste\nSectors have lots of gaps and there is a\nneed for capacity building in collecting and\ndocumenting data.\nn\nn National Emissions Factors are not available.\n4.2.2 Climate change mitigation\nmeasures tracking\nJordan’s experience with GHG mitigation analysis\nhas been limited to national communications and\nreporting to UNFCCC. In addition, Jordan has\nhad limited experience with clean development\nmechanism (CDM) projects, as stated in the\nProposal for Market Readiness. Out of 15 project\nproposals that received letters of approval from\nthe Ministry of Environment, the Designated\nNational Authority (DNA), only 4 CDM projects\nhave been registered with UNFCCC.\nThe limited CDM experience in Jordan highlights\nthe lack of technical capacity among local experts\non project identification and development\nincluding crediting methodologies, which led\nto increased transaction costs for developing\nCDM projects. In addition to the need to recruit\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation and verification of reductions,\nJordan had to seek an international entity because\nsuch expertise is not available at the local level.\nThe lessons learnt from Jordan’s experience\nwith CDM development indicated that there is\na need to significantly strengthen institutional\nframeworks and technical capacity in order to\ndeliver a pipeline of verified mitigation activities.\nThis includes the need to develop capacities for\ngathering data and for monitoring and verifying\nthe effect of mitigation actions. There is also a need\nto enhance the capacities of decision makers in\nthe public sector.\n4.2.3 Tracking received support\nClimate finance sources at the national level\nNational institutions that are responsible for\nreceiving and distributing climate change funds\ninclude:\nn\nn Ministry of Environment\nn\nn Ministry of Finance\nn\nn Ministry of Planning and International\nCooperation\nn\nn Other Line Ministries\nn\nn Development Banks: AFD, KFW, UNDP, EBRD,\nIFC, EU, etc.\nn\nn Direct aid: USAID, Abu Dhabi Fund for\nEconomic\nDevelopment\nn\nn Specialized climate finance: EBRD, EIB, KfW,\nand Jordan Sustainable Finance Facility\nsupported by EU NIF Grants\nn\nn Domestic public funding: Public sector\nfunding through line Ministries\nn\nn Local funding institutions: Agricultural Credit\nCorporation funding, JEDCO, ACI, CBJ, GDF\nMore details are provided hereafter on the sources\nof finance in Jordan for climate change and green\nprojects.\nn\nn International funding sources: As a developing\neconomy, Jordan has received international\naid from development banks and other\nsources.\nn\nn Development banks are a major source\nof finance for green growth projects and\ninitiatives. The list of development banks\nincludes (though not limited to) the Agence\nFrançaise de Developpement (AFD), KfW,\nthe United Nations Development Program\n(UNDP), the European Bank for Reconstruction\nand Development (EBRD), International\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n127\nFinance Corporation (IFC), the European Union\n(EU), the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic\nDevelopment (KFAED), and others. Aid from\nthese institutions is commonly coordinated\nthrough MOPIC, which plays a key role in\ndonor coordination and project engagement.\nn\nn Direct aid plays a part in Jordan’s green\neconomy sector.\nn\nn Finance sources are various. For example,\nUS alone provides financial aid to Jordan,\nincluding from the following sources that\nare related directly and indirectly to climate\naction:\n-\tEconomic assistance from USAID (approximately\nUSD 1 billion per year), focusing on Jordan’s\nwater infrastructure development.\n-\tMillennium Challenge Account (approximately\nUSD 275 million), which is assisting the\ndevelopment of Jordan’s water efficiency\nand water treatment programs.\n-\tLoan guarantees to assist small and medium\nenterprises (SMEs) in Jordan through various\nmechanisms including the Jordan Loan Fund\nGuarantee to de-risk business loans, which\nis also used by SMEs in the green economy\nsector.\nn\nn Specialized Climate Finance\nJordan receives financial assistance from\nvarious specialized green funds. For example,\nthe Jordan Sustainable Finance Facility has\nbeen recently set up by EBRD, EIB, and KfW,\nand supported by EU NIF grants, with a pilot\nfunding of €34.5million. It is worth mentioning\nthat Jordan has not been as active as other\ndeveloping nations in accessing the increasingly\nimportant climate funds that are being set up\nfor green energy projects. A key example is the\nGlobal Climate Fund, for which as of yet, no\nJordanian entity has been granted eligibility.\nSignificant opportunities exist to access this\nnascent yet very large pool of funds for green\ngrowth projects.\nn\nn Commercial/private financing\nJordan has also been the recipient of direct\nfinancial investment and debt finance from\nthe international commercial banking sector.\nSome of the recent renewables projects,\nincluding the Adenium Energy solar PV plants\nin Ma’an and the Falcon Ma’an for Solar Energy\nproject obtained private financing as part of a\nconsortium of investors. Nearly all renewable\nenergy projects in Jordan have required some\nform of financing or underwriting from key\ninternational development banks or grants.\nDevelopment assistance is provided primarily\nthrough concessional loans, co-financing, or\nequity investments into green growth projects.\nFurthermore, JREEEF has been set up to channel\na range of funding, including international aid\nand development funds, to renewable and\nenergy efficiency projects.\nn\nn Local funding sources\n-\tPublic sector funding: the public sector\nconstitutes the major source of local funding\nfor green projects in Jordan. The majority\nof projects are financed through national\nbudgetary contributions, supported by\ndevelopment partners, including key national\ninfrastructure projects.\n-\tLocal funding institutions such as the\nAgricultural Credit Corporation, a quasigovernment lending facility, supports farmers\noperating under the umbrella of the Ministry\nof Agriculture.\n-\tOther sources of funding that play a role in\nthe financing of the green growth sector in\nJordan include:\nØ Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation (JLGC):\nThe JLGC is sponsored by the Overseas\nPrivate Investment Corporation and is\noperated by the Government Development\nFund. It is a loan guarantee scheme focused\non SME lending.\nØ \nJordan Enterprise Development Corporation\n(JEDCO) – grant funding.\nØ \nAmman Chamber of Industry (ACI) – grant\nfunding.\nØ \n \nCentral Bank of Jordan (CBJ) – loans and\nGovernorates Development Fund (GDF).\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n128\nStatus at the national level\nJordan,\nlike\nother\ndeveloping\ncountries,\nencounters a number of challenges in verifying the\nclimate finance information on support provided\nby developed countries. The current status in\nJordan suffers from the following challenges:\nn\nn Insufficient institutional arrangements: There\nare no sufficient institutional arrangements\nin Jordan that define clear roles and\nresponsibilities of different ministries with\nregard to climate change.\nThe Ministry of Environment is mandated to\ncoordinate climate change-related activities.\nBut it is the activities of other sectoral ministries\nthat are affected by, or have the potential affect,\nclimate change. Furthermore, MOPIC and the\nMinistry of Finance are in the driver’s seat in\ndefining national development priorities and\nformulating the national budget. The national\nbudget does not include a specific allocation\nfor climate change activities. In addition, MOPIC\nand the Ministry of Finance are the entities\nwho engage with development partners and\nhelp maintain records of Official Development\nAssistance (ODA) flowing to various sectors.\nThere also is no effective coordination and\ninformation sharing regarding climate finance\nor integrating climate change into development\nplanning at national, sectoral, and subnational\nlevels.\nn\nn Inconsistent definitions and criteria in\ndefining climate finance and in distinguishing\nclimate finance from other forms of finance\nis a challenge inherent in all climate finance\nmonitoring efforts, whether by a contributor\nor a recipient. The key issue is how to\ndistinguish climate finance from ODA and\nhow to determine the proportion of climate\nfinance that is additional to ODA.\nn\nn Inconsistent markers, indicators, and codes\nto characterize financial data may include:\n-\tDeveloping indicators for adaptation finance\ncan be difficult.\n-\tDeveloping indicators for climate finance is\nespecially challenging for projects that have\nmultiple objectives.\n-\tIndicators are also challenging for cross sectoral\nprojects that include climate-related benefits,\nbut do not primarily focus on climate.\nn\nn Insufficient technical processes and systems\nto identify and record climate finance\nexpenditures (such as reporting formats and\nsoftware platforms for storing and sharing\ninformation) and mechanisms to integrate\nclimate change into national systems for\nbudgeting, monitoring, and reporting.\nn\nn Limitations on the availability of private\nfinancial data.\nHaving an effective monitoring, reporting, and\nverification system for climate finance that\naddresses the gaps and challenges discussed,\nincluding clear roles and responsibilities for\ndifferent actors, can help countries determine\nwhere climate finance is flowing, whether it is\nbeing used in line with its intended purpose, and\ncan facilitate accessing climate change support\nand financing.\n4.3 Suggested Framework for MRV\nThe government of Jordan is committed to\nmeeting the challenge of tackling climate change.\nHaving a strong support and collaboration among\nall stakeholders will ensure a successful transition\ntowards a green, lowcarbon, and sustainable\neconomy.\nThe involvement of all entities in designing a\nrobust multi-level MRV system that possesses the\nrequired flexibility and benefits all, will increase the\nchances of success and long-term sustainability.\nAdopting a systems-based approach including\na clear process design, responsibilities, data\nflows, and a supporting governance structure is\nimportant for the implementation of an effective\nMRV.\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n129\nThe MRV can be best thought of as a system, which\nincludes various elements like process design,\nactivity data flows, governance mechanisms,\nand information technology (IT) support systems.\nIt is suggested to have a legal arrangement in the\nform of by-laws, memorandums of understanding\n(MoUs), and agreements. The agreements or MoUs\nsigned should enable the national focal point to\ndirectly access the data platforms to access the\nactivity data at the Ministries in question. These\nagreements provide certainty about the type of\ndata, the format, and timely access.\nThe IT support system should be designed in close\ncollaboration with all stakeholders and should\nconsider their specific needs. All stakeholders\nshould be involved at early stages and consulted\nin determining the process design, and data flows,\nsuch as what data will be made available, when\nit will be collected, and in what form.\nThe overall purpose of the domestic institutional\narrangements for MRV is to:\nn\nn Meet the reporting requirements of UNFCCC.\nn\nn Further build national capacities and ensure\nthe sustainability of reporting processes.\nn\nn Inform\nnational\nand\ninternational\npolicymakers at different levels.\nn\nn Assist in institutionalizing activities related to\nreporting on climate change.\nThe following subsections describe a framework\nfor a suggested domestic MRV system for climate\naction.\n4.3.1 MRV- GHG inventory emissions\nThe ultimate objective of having an MRV system\nfor emissions is fulfilling UNFCCC obligations to\nreport on levels of GHG emissions by sources and\nremovals by sinks.\nThe MRV system for emissions addresses gathering\ndata for the estimation of GHG emissions by\nsources and removals by sinks to generate a\nnational GHG Inventory, which is reported and\nverified in national communications and biennial\nupdate reports. Data collection, emission factor\nassessment and development, and emissions\ncalculations are of importance. Adopting a systems\napproach will ensure MRV sustainability and will\nimprove transparency, accuracy, comparability,\ncompleteness, and consistency. Planned activities,\nprocedures, methodologies, and responsible\nentities are outlined in Table 4.1.\nSince the national GHG Inventory addresses\ndifferent sectors, the activity data need to be\ncollected from various entities and organizations,\nor data providers. A systems approach that is\ngoverned by solid institutional arrangement\nwould allow well-defined flows of data from data\nproviders to four main sectoral units, which will\nin turn feed the data into the central registry unit\nat the Ministry of Environment, as illustrated in\nFigure 4.1.\nThe data are made available to the registry unit\nat the MoEnv from the sectoral central units on\na biannual basis. The national GHG Inventory\ncompiler will use the data to estimate and report\nthe national GHG Inventory annually, according to\nUNFCCC guidelines and the IPCC software.\nThe GHG Inventory is then subjected to multiple\nreviews by national and international accredited\nbodies, such as the UNEP-UNDP Global Support\nprogram (GSP), academic institutions, or local\nresearch entities. The inventory is then submitted\nto UNFCCC Secretariat for final verification and\napproval as part of the NCs and BURs, as illustrated\nin Figure 4.2.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n130\nTable 4.1: Suggested design for MRV of GHG inventory emissions\nMRV for GHG\nInventory\nEmissions\nThe ultimate objective of having an MRV system for emissions is fulfilling\nUNFCCC obligations to report on levels of GHG emissions by sources and\nremovals by sinks.\nThe MRV system for emissions deals with gathering data for the measurement\nof GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks to generate a national\nGHG Inventory, which is reported and verified in national communications\nand biennial update reports.\nLead institution\nMinistry of Environment\nInstitutions\ninvolved in\nprocess\nLine ministries, GAM, and data providers\nProcedure\nMeasurement - collection of activity data\nMinistry of Environment has MoUs with: MEMR, Chamber of Industry, and\nDOS to provide data on a biannual basis.\n-\tMEMR has MOUs with energy sector data providers.\n-\tDOS has MOUs with AFOLU and waste sector data providers.\n-\tChamber of Industry has MOUs with IPPU data providers.\nReporting - GHG inventory estimation\n-\tUsing the IPCC Guidelines for the estimation of GHG emissions from various\nsectors.\n-\tCompilation of the overall national GHG Inventory by the Ministry of\nEnvironment.\nVerification\n-\tLocal technical review.\n-\tInternational review by an accredited/referenced entity, e.g., UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Programme (GSP).\nMethodology\nfor estimation\nThe methodologies for measurement are not defined by the Convention.

Defining\na reasonable baseline scenario is considered a\ncritical element in the abatement assessment\nsince the benefits and incremental costs of\nmitigation options are directly linked to a\nsound definition of the baseline scenario.\nn\nn The mitigation scenario is structured according\nto a set of criteria reflecting country-specific\nconditions such as the potential for a large\nchange on GHG emissions, direct and indirect\neconomic impacts, consistency with national\ndevelopment goals, potential effectiveness of\nimplementation policies, sustainability of an\noption, data availability for evaluation, and\nother sector-specific criteria.\nThe methodologies for measurement are not\ndefined by the Convention. In undertaking\nemissions\nmanagement,\nParties\ncould\nrely on methodologies developed by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) (e.g., IPCC 1996/2006) or GHG Protocol\ncalculation tools and standards.\nThe GHG mitigation measures are planned and\nimplemented by the project owner with external\ntechnical support, if needed. Baseline, mitigation,\nand feasibility analysis must be performed and\nreported to and with the support of the registry\n(activity data unit at the MoEnv). Planned activities,\nprocedures, methodologies, and responsible\nentities are outlined in Table 4.2.\nThe implementation of planned activities is\nmonitored by the Ministry of Environment.

It is recommended to collect\nthe data as follows:\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ninternational support for the public sector\nthrough MoPIC. Public sector organizations\ninclude:\n-\tMinistries such as MWI, MEMR, MOA, MOH,\nMOE, MOT, MOMA, and MOIT.\n-\tGAM and other municipalities.\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ninternational support for universities through\nthe Ministry of Higher Education.\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ninternational support for NGOs through the\nMinistry of Social Development.\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on loans\nfrom banks for green projects through the\nCentral Bank of Jordan (CBJ).\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ncommercial/private financing, direct financial\ninvestment, and debt finance through the\npublic-private partnership (PPP) unit at the\nMinistry of Finance.\nThe task of verification of received support is\nsuggested to be the responsibility of MoPIC.\nPlanned activities, procedures, methodologies,\nand responsible entities are outlined in Table 4.3.\nA diagram illustrating a suggested MRV System\nfor Received Support is shown in Figure 4.4.\nThe above framework system for support is in line\nwith the recommendation of the Green Economy\nStrategy of having a standalone, independent\nunit or team (such as the Green Economy Unit at\nthe MoEnv) to provide technical assistance with\nregard to green finance to the government under\npatronage of the Ministerial Council.\nThe mandate of this unit as suggested by the\nGreen Economy Strategy is to:\nØAdvise on and support progress on all finance\nmatters for green growth projects in Jordan.\nØBuild capacity of key government and regulatory\nstakeholders through training and awareness\nraising.\nØAct as facilitators in project development,\noffering expert advice and support as a public\nservice to loan or grant applicants. A number\nof promising green projects never make it\nto a “bankable” project, as stakeholders lack\nexperience. Providing this expertise can be a\nvalue-added service to the Jordanian market.\nØAct as technical advisors to fund providers who\nwant to act as lenders, equity investors, or loan\nguarantors.\nØDevelop and execute an engagement and\nawareness “roadshow” for private sector\nstakeholders in and outside of Jordan to attract\ninterest in financing green growth projects in\nJordan.\nIn addition to the finance technical assistance\nmandate, it is suggested to add tracking and\nreporting mandate for climate finance. It is needed\nto work towards increased transparency and clear\ndefinitions for climate finance spanning both the\ntype of flows to be included (public and private)\nand the types of activities that are eligible to be\ntracked (e.g., mitigation, adaptation, enabling\nactivities, reporting). Thus, the unit that oversees\nthe MRV for support (Green Economy Unit) needs\nto elaborate on how the unit plans to achieve a\npractical efficient MRV tracking system for climate\nfinance, which may include:\nn\nn Creating definitions and criteria to define\nclimate finance (distinguishing climate\nfinance from other forms of finance). This can\nbe coordinated with MoEnv, climate change\ndirectorate team.\nn\nn The need to decide on the level of detail for\na classification system, as follows:\n-\tA broad classification system may consider only\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n137\nwhether an activity is identified as being an\nadaption or a mitigation project.\n-\t   A second level of detail could consider\nmitigation activities by sector - for example,\nenergy,\nforestry,\ntransportation,\nor\nmanufacturing.\n- A further layer of detail may look at subsectors.\nFor example, energy-sector activities may\nbe subdivided by technology: wind, solar,\ngeothermal, nuclear, and so on. Jordan will\nhave to determine a level of detail that is\npractical, and which meets its internal policy\nneeds. Moreover, Jordan will need to consider\nhow to identify climate adaptation projects,\nwith respect to national development plans\nand programs and development assistance\nprojects.\nn\nn Defining clear and well-defined roles and\nresponsibilities for the preparation of GHG\ninventory estimates (both internally and\nexternally), a quality assurance/quality\ncontrol plan, a working archive system, and\na description of the process for collecting data\nand developing GHG inventory estimates.\nTable 4.3: Suggested design of an MRV system for received support\nMRV for\nSupport\nThe objective of the MRV system for support (namely, climate finance,\ntechnology transfer, and capacity building) is to track provision and receipt\nof climate support and monitor the results achieved, and assess their impact.\nLead institution\nMinistry of Environment\nInstitutions\ninvolved in\nprocess\nMoPIC, Line Ministries, GAM, project owners and data providers\nProcedure\nPreparation of a national regulation that provides guidance on measuring,\ntracking, and reporting of climate change received support.\nMethodology\nfor estimation\nThe methodologies for measurement are not defined by the Convention.\nParties are free to create their own methodologies that suits their national\ncircumstances.\nMeasurement- collection of activity data\n-\tMinistry of Environment prepare MoUs with data providers\nResources,\ncapacities, staff,\nand tools\nn\nn Dedicated staff for data collection at each central unit.\nn\nn Templates for measurements, reporting, and verification.\nn\nn IT tools and database platforms for data storage and reporting.\nTimeframe\nBiannual effort to generate an annual report.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n138\nFigure 4.4: Suggested MRV system for received support\nRegistry Unit - MRV of Support\n( at Green Economy Unit - MoEnV )\nData Feed in from the central units\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\ninternational\nsupport for Public\nMoPIC :\nPublic Sector\nInclude :\n- Ministries such\nas MWI, MEMR,\nMOA ,MOH,\nMOE, MOT\nMOMA and\nMOIT\n- GAM and other\nMunicipalities.\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\ninternational\nsupport for\nUniversities\nthrough:\n( Ministry of\nHigher\nEducation )\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\ninternational\nsupport for\nNGOs through:\n( Ministry of\nSocial\nDevelopment )\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\nLoans from Banks\nfor Green Projects\nthrough:\nCentral Bank of\nJordan\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\nCommercial /\nPrivate Financing\ndirect ﬁnancial\ninvestment and\ndebt ﬁnance\nthrough\n( PPP Unit at MOF )\nVeriﬁcation - thorugh MoPIC\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n139\n4.3.4 Suggested overall domestic\nMRV system\nThe overall MRV system will be under the\nlead of the Ministry of Environment, where all\ninformation should feed in to the Climate Change\nDirectorate and green economy unit.

Improved coordination is an\nimportant step to ensure better tracking of climate\nfinance flows (technical assistance, capacity\nbuilding, and technology).\nIn 2016, Jordan has submitted its Market\nReadiness Proposal (MRP) to the Partnership for\nMarket Readiness (PMR) initiative. The Jordan\nMRP outlines a plan for the implementation\nof necessary market readiness components to\nsupport the development of appropriate market\nbased instruments.\nA multi-tiered integrated MRV system for Jordan is\nbeing developed based on the proposal submitted\nby the Government of Jordan and the World Bank.\nThe MRV system design is being developed in\nconsultation with different national stakeholders\nand it is anticipated to be completed soon.\nReferences\nn\nn Handbook on Measurement, Reporting, and\nVerification for Developing Country Parties:\nhttps://unfccc.int/files/national_reports/\nannex_i_natcom_/application/pdf/nonannex_i_mrv_handbook.pdf, accessed in\nFebruary 2017.\nn\nn https://www.thepmr.org/system/files/\ndocuments/PMR%20Jordan_Market%20\nReadiness%20Proposal_Final_2April2016.\npdf, accessed in February 2017.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n140\n\nUPDATED\nGAPS AND\nCONSTRAINTS,\nAND RELATED\nNEEDS\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n142\n5.1 Introduction\nAccording to decision 2/CP.17, non-Annex I\nParties should provide updated information\non constraints and gaps, and related financial,\ntechnical, and capacity-building needs.\nAlso, non-Annex I Parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity building, and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nAccordingly, this chapter seeks to provide a\nbrief description of the constraints and gaps\nidentified in previous national climate change\ncommunications. It will also identify newly arising\nconstraints and gaps, and needed actions and\nresources required to overcome them.\n5.2 Institutional Constraints and Gaps\nand Policy Mainstreaming\nJordan is continuously striving to improve national\nGHG estimation and reporting to the UNFCCC.\nTo achieve continuous improvement in national\nreporting, constraints, gaps, and related financial,\ntechnical, and capacity building, needs should be\nidentified, and appropriate measures taken and\nimplemented to address them.\nIn order to fulfil the obligations arising from\nthe Cancun and Durban Conference of Parties\n(COP) decisions related to the submission of\nnational communications and biennial update\nreports, further support is needed to continue\nto develop and consolidate existing technical\nand institutional capacities and to continue the\nefforts of integrating climate change into national\npolicies, plans, and programs.\nIn 2013, a milestone was achieved in Jordan with\nthe launch and adoption of the first National\nClimate Change Policy (NCCP) in the country\nand in the region. The policy was drafted to\naccommodate all national climate change\npriorities for action and to provide a highly\nflexible policy reference point, upon which further\nstrategies and sectoral policies can be based. The\nimplementation of NCCP relies on the framework\nof the laws, agendas, and strategies developed by\nthe related ministries and authorities to provide\nan enabling environment.\n In August 2014, the Ministry of Environment has\ncreated the Directorate of Climate Change (CCD).\nThe Directorate acts as the institutional hub for\ncoordinating and developing all climate change\nactivities in Jordan in relation to the UNFCCC and\nthe global climate change governance system and\ninitiatives. According to the recently approved\ninstitutional framework, the overall objective of\nthe Climate Change Directorate is to follow-up on\nand strengthen the implementation of provisions\nof UNFCCC and any related legal instruments that\nthe COP may adopt and which Jordan ratifies.\nThe creation of the CCD has been a milestone in\nimproving the institutional structure of climate\nchange in Jordan. However, the Directorate\nshould be strengthened by adding more staff\nand enhancing their capacities.\nFurthermore, a representative National Committee\non Climate Change (NCCC) has been established in\nApril 2001 by a decision by the Prime Minister. NCCC\nmembership includes a number of stakeholders\ndirectly associated with climate change related\nsectors in Jordan. Current NCCC members\nrepresent line ministries, public institutions,\nresearch and academic organizations, and NGOs.\nThe NCCC is a platform for the integration of multistakeholder dialogue and planning on climate\nchange. Currently, the terms of reference and\nmandate of the NCCC are under review by MoEnv\nto enhance its role and mandate and facilitate\nthe exchange of data and information among\ncommittee members.\nPublic policy in Jordan has not adopted a national\nGHG emissions target.

Jordan\ntends to promote mitigation measures that are\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n143\njustified by objectives other than climate change\nstabilization, such as cost-effectiveness, energy\nsecurity, economic competitiveness, reducing\nenergy expenses, and improving access to energy\nservices.\n5.3 Technical and Capacity Building\nNeeds\n5.3.1 GHG inventory\n5.3.1.1 Gaps and constraints\nidentified during the previous\nnational communications and\nrecommendation to address them\na) Gaps, constraints, and capacity building\nneeds identified during the previous National\nCommunications (NCs):\n-\tPreviously, GHG inventories were estimated\nonly as part of the NCs preparation project ,\nand thus lacked continuity and sustainability.\nData were collected by sending paper letters\nrequesting data from potential data providers,\na process that was both time consuming\nand tedious. This arrangement does not\nserve national efforts to prepare periodical\ninventories for NCs and BURs to the UNFCCC.\n-\tThere was a lack of institutional arrangement\nto support collection of data needed for\nestimating the national GHG inventory,\nparticularly from the private and industrial\nsector.\n-\tData quality, completeness, and accuracy were\na primary concern. In addition, most data were\navailable in a format not suitable for GHG\ninventory estimation. The lack of disaggregate\ndata was a barrier to improving the bottom\nup estimation.\n-\tAll stakeholders experienced shortage in\ntechnical staff proficient in converting raw\nprimary data to a form that can readily be\nused by the GHG inventory software.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\nAs part of the FBUR project, a framework for a\ndomestic MRV system for GHG Emissions Inventory\nhas been suggested to address most of the above\ngaps, constrains, and needs, as follows:\n-\tA dedicated entity is suggested to be created\nto oversee collection and processing of data\nfor GHG estimation by setting up institutional\narrangements and clear responsibilities and\nmandates.\n-\tThe institutional arrangements shall ensure the\ncontinuous and sustainable flow of data from\nall governmental and private data providers\nto be used for periodical BURs, NCs, and GHG\ninventory estimation as well as for any other\npurposes.\n-\tThe suggested MRV system for GHG emissions\nwill ensure verification of data to ensure\nquality, accuracy, and completeness.\n-\tA national effort is ongoing supported by the\nPartnership for Market Readiness to design\nand implement a detailed multi-level MRV\nsystem.\n5.3.1.2 Additional gaps and constraints\nnewly identified during the current\nbur and recommendations to address\nthem\na) Additional gaps and constraints newly identified\nduring the current BUR:\n-\tThere is a need to build capacity in the use of\nthe 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Software.\n-\tThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and 2012\ndid not provide emission estimates for indirect\nGHGs such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen\noxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic\ncompounds (NMVOC), and other gases not\ncontrolled by the Montreal Protocol, such as\nsulphur oxides (SOx) because the 2006 IPCC\nSoftware does not support the estimation of\nthose gases.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n144\n-\tThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 have been estimated using the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines, which have structural and\nmethodological differences with the Revised\n1996 IPCC Guidelines used in estimating GHG\nemissions inventories for earlier national\ncommunications (NCs), which made it difficult\nto provide a consistent time series.\n-\tIn preparing all GHG inventories so far, default\nemission factors (EFs) were used since there\nare no available studies to develop national\nemission factors. The use of national EFs is\nhighly vital, particularly for key categories\nwithin the inventory.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\n-\tIt is recommended to conduct training\nand capacity building workshops on the\npreparation of GHG inventories, including\ndetailed use of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and\ndata sheets and calculations. This will widen\nthe base of national experts. As part of the\ncurrent BUR effort, capacity building activities\nhave been held for use of the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines and Software. However, further\ncapacity building for use of these guidelines\nis still needed, given that the Guidelines have\nbeen used for the first time in preparing the\nFBUR.\n-\tAs per Decision 17/CP.8, non-Annex I Parties\nare encouraged, as appropriate, to report\non anthropogenic emissions of indirect\nGHGs and other gases not controlled by the\nMontreal Protocol, at the discretion of the\nParties. To fulfill this decision requirement and\nto improve the completeness of the inventory,\nit is recommended to estimate the emissions\nof these gases using EMEP/EEA air pollutant\nemission inventory guidebook.\n-\tIn Decision 2 CP.17, each non-Annex I Party is\nencouraged to provide a consistent time series\nback to the years reported in the previous\nNCs. Therefore, it is recommended to use the\n2006 IPCC Software to re-report the previous\nnational communications’ inventories.\n-\tA key category analysis has been performed\nas part of this BUR. It is recommended that\nJordan search for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to\nthe extent possible and based on software\nreadiness and national circumstances, Tier 2\nmethods in the categories identified as key.\nThus, research should be directed to develop\nnational emission factors to be able to use\nhigher tiers for key categories.\n5.3.2 GHG mitigation measures\n5.3.2.1 Gaps and constraints\nidentified during the previous\nnational communications and\nrecommendations to address them\na) Gaps, constraints, and capacity building needs\nidentified during the previous NCs:\n-\tStakeholders had limited expertise in and\nknowledge capacity for conducting mitigation\nanalysis for the transportation, IPPU, AFOLU,\nand waste sectors.\n-\tThe complex nature of mitigation actions\nand initiatives that are being developed\nand implemented within the UNFCCC had\nbeen a challenge. The various potentials\nand features of CDM, NAMAs, LEDs, INDCs,\nand other mitigation tools make it difficult\nfor a holistic planning perspective in climate\nchange mitigation.\n-\tData quality, completeness, and accuracy\nare of a primary concern when it comes to\nestablishing the baseline and mitigation\nanalysis. Data are not up to date, nor are they\nreadily available in one place.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\n-\tIt is recommended to expand the expertise base\nand the knowledge capacity for conducting\nmitigation analysis through an extensive\ntraining program.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n145\n-\tIt is recommended to raise awareness on\ninternational\nmitigation\nmechanisms\nand initiatives among all decision makers\nand stakeholders to benefit from those\nmechanisms. It is also recommended that\nthe MoEnv continue to provide support\nfor technical capacity building related to\naccessing those mechanisms.\n-\tIt is recommended to conduct continuous and\nup to date surveys to provide quality and\naccurate data to be used for analysis.\n-\tAs part of the FBUR project, a framework for a\ndomestic MRV system for GHG Mitigation has\nbeen suggested that addresses most of the\nabove gaps, constrains, and needs, as follows:\nØA dedicated entity is suggested to be created\nto oversee collection and processing of data\nfor GHG estimation by setting up institutional\narrangements and clear responsibilities and\nmandates.\nØThe suggested MRV system for GHG emissions\nwill ensure verification of data to ensure quality,\naccuracy, and completeness.\nØA national effort is ongoing supported by the\nPartnership for Market Readiness to design and\nimplement a detailed multi-level MRV system.\n5.3.2.2 Additional gaps and\nconstraints newly identified\nduring the current BUR and\nrecommendations to address them\na) Additional gaps and constraints newly identified\nduring the current BUR:\n-\tThere is limited experience in Jordan in\nmitigation model analysis. The LEAP software,\nwhich replaced the more familiar ENPEP\nmodel, has just been newly introduced to\nJordan for use in climate change energy\nmitigation analysis.\n-\tThe Jordanian case built in this current FBUR\nusing the LEAP model has been developed\nas project-based rather than as a programbased scenario.\n-\tIn this FBUR, no mitigation projects have\nbeen identified for the transportation\nsector, although it is a major GHG emitter.\nAddressing the transportation sector has\nproved to be difficult because of the lack of\nexpertise in mitigation analysis and of clarity\nin responsibilities and mandates among\ndifferent institutions working within the\nsector.\n-\tIn preparing this FBUR, the energy data used\nin the mitigation analysis for residential\nbuildings, transportation, agriculture, and offroad vehicles were obtained from relatively\nold surveys and there were gaps in the\navailability of some data.\n-\tThere is a need to have a dependable mitigation\ntracking system for planning, implementation,\nand verification of emissions reduction.\nHaving such a system in place will facilitate\naccess to international and national funds\nand grants.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\n-\tAs part of current BUR capacity building\nactivities, two training workshops have been\nheld on the use of LEAP, but further training\nin using the LEAP model use is needed.\n-\tThe Jordanian case built in this current FBUR\nusing the LEAP model should be adopted\nand\nfurther\ndeveloped\nin\nupcoming\nnational communications and BURs. It is also\nrecommended to start using LEAP to generate\nprogram based scenarios rather than project\nbased scenarios to improve coverage and\ngenerate more impact.\n-\tThe transportation sector is a major GHG emitter\nand therefore, there is a need to suggest\nmitigation projects and programs. Capacity\nbuilding among all institutions working within\nthe sector should be developed to perform\nmitigation analysis.\n-\tIt is recommended to have up to date surveys\nthat provide current data on a continuous\nbasis.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n146\n5.4 Technology Needs Assessment\nand Technology Transfer\nThe Ministry of Environment, with GEF-UNDP\nsupport, has earlier published a technology needs\nassessment (TNA) and technology transfer report\nfor 2004-2005. More recently, the Ministry has\ncompleted a climate change technology needs\nassessment for Jordan for the period 2015-2017.\nThe project is being implemented through\na partnership between the United Nations\nEnvironment Program (UNEP) and the Technical\nUniversity of Denmark (DTU), and is known as\nUNEP-DTU Partnership. Three reports have been\npublished by this project. The first report is for the\nselection of priority mitigation and adaptation\nsectors for TNA activities in Jordan. The second\nreport presented a list of the main barriers and\nan enabling framework, while the third report,\nwhich was published in August 2017, offered a\ntechnology action plan for two priority mitigation\nsectors (energy and transport) and two priority\nadaptation sectors (water and agriculture). The\nfollowing TNA analysis is extracted from the three\npublished reports.\nResults revealed the following top three\ntechnologies, prioritized, out of a long initial roster\nof assessed technologies in each targeted sector.\nThe top three mitigation technologies for the\nenergy sector were:\n(1) Solar thermal,\n(2) PV for electrification, and\n(3) PV for water pumping.\nThe three top-ranked priority mitigation\ntechnologies for the transportation sector were:\n(1) Bus Rapid Transit,\n(2) Improving pedestrian infrastructure, and\n(3)  Ticketing systems to improve the quality\nand the attractiveness of public transport\nservices.\nThe final results for the water sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Roof-top rainwater harvesting,\n(2) Augmenting and expansion of Water Users\nAssociation (WUAs), and\n(3) Desalination and brackish water treatment\nand re-use.\nThe results for the agricultural sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Water saving technologies, such as drip or\nsubsurface irrigation,\n(2) Farm-level water harvesting, and\n(3) Plant varieties resistant to climate change.\nThe report has also provided a combined\ntechnology action plan (TAP) for the three priority\ntechnologies for each sector and key projects have\nbeen suggested to turn ideas into action.\nEnergy Sector\nThe main actions proposed are:\nn\nn Removal of financial and economic barriers;\nn\nn Enforcement of standards;\nn\nn Focused training programs; and\nn\nn Effective awareness programs.\nThe following three main project ideas have been\nsuggested:\nn\nn Designing financial support mechanisms and\nsubsidizes for solar powered systems;\nn\nn Developing a complete PV process industry;\nfrom silicon to module;\nn\nn Developing a high-tech comprehensive solar\nthermal industry; flat, evacuated tube, and\nparabolic trough technologies.\nTransportation Sector\nThe main actions proposed are:\nn\nn Introducing regulations that incentivize users\nand potential users of public transportation;\nn\nn Planning strategic rehabilitation of the main\nstreets that will contain BRT lanes;\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n147\nn\nn Institutionalizing the roles of stakeholders;\nn\nn Organizing capacity building programs for\ndrivers and operators; and\nn\nn Organizing a broad awareness campaign to\nincentivize users and the potential users of\npublic transportation.\nThe following three main project ideas have been\nsuggested:\nn\nn Establishing a new sustainable transportation\ngraduate course of study (Master degree\nprogram) at Jordanian universities to train\npractitioners in this understaffed field;\nn\nn Planning a public transportation project\nbetween Amman and Irbid;\nn\nn Modernizing public transportation vehicles.\nWater Sector\nThe three technologies prioritized in the\nwater sector have distinctive characteristics\nand independent applied aspects in terms of\nresources, management modalities, beneficiary\ngroups, and stakeholders involved as well as\nunique technical and governance barriers. Thus,\nthe three technologies were addressed and\nassessed separately. Moreover, each technology\nhas its unique scale and context of deployment\nas follows:\nRoof-top rain water harvesting (RWH)\ntechnology:\nAmong the actions proposed for this technology\nare:\nn\nn Conducting a technical assessment and\nscreening study to identify the most\nappropriate modality of RWH technology for\ndifferent types of building settings in Jordan;\nn\nn Revising or developing a new water efficiency\ncode/by-law for buildings to regulate water\nefficiency measures including RWH. The\nproposed code would address regulatory\nincentives such as tax cuts and fees deduction\nto encourage compliance by housing\nconstruction companies with RWH directives\n(building codes) and enhance feasibility and\npayback period;\nn\nn Developing awareness and information\ndissemination programs targeting relevant\nbodies (Ministry of Water and Irrigation,\nJordan Engineers Association, Contractors\nAssociation).\nSome actions inspired new project ideas. For\nexample, the TAP for RWH inspired a proposal to\nestablish a Regional Green Building Engineering\nTraining Center in Jordan, which will be a\nfully-fledged demonstration green building\nwith installed RWH technology among other\nsustainable building-oriented technologies (such\nas greywater, insulation, RE & EE technologies).\nEmpowerment and Expansion of WUAs\nTechnology\nAmong the actions proposed for this technology\nare:\nn\nn Having a suitable law governing WUAs to\nempower its operations in Jordan;\nn\nn Strengthening WUAs to enable them to\nperform the mandated tasks (irrigation\nmanagement transfer);\nn\nn Attaining effective means of financial\nsustainability for WUAs and building their\ncapacity to develop income-generating\nactivities and projects;\nn\nn Establishing a program for continuous\ntraining and capacity building and developing\neffective coordination and communication\nplatforms for WUAs in the Jordan Valley;\nn\nn Developing capacity building programs to\nempower WUAs in marketing the concept\nof WUA as an innovation in participatory\nirrigation management, and improving the\nskills of WUAs in marketing their products;\nIt is expected that the above actions will become\ncomponents of one mega program seeking to\naccelerate full irrigation management transfer\nto the WUAs throughout the Jordan Valley. This\nwill contribute to removing the barriers for WUAs\nand facilitate its expansion in other parts of the\ncountry, such as southern Jordan.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n148\nDesalination and Brackish Water Treatment\nand Re-use\nBecause investment in these technologies requires\na high capital cost, the scale for potential diffusion\nof this technology will be confined to a pilot site\nof promising readiness and preference for the\nauthorities in charge (Water Authority of Jordan).\nAmong the actions proposed for this technology\nare:\nn\nn Promoting reasonable system prices for\ncapital and operating costs through costeffective desalination units integrated with\nenergy solutions (such as solar energy);\nn\nn Promoting and providing incentives to locallyproduced and assembled desalination units;\nand\nn\nn Promoting technologies of less environmental\nimpact.\nA well identified project idea for this technology\nis the installation of a PV-powered desalination\nplant with a capacity 3-3.5 MCM/year to be utilized\nfor drinking water supply to Amman and the local\narea. A suggested site is the Al Husban Well Field\n(a set of 4 groundwater wells on the Dead Sea\nGroundwater Basin).\nAgriculture Sector\nThe three technologies prioritized in the\nagricultural sector have distinctive characteristics\nand independent applied aspects in terms of\nresources, management modalities, beneficiary\ngroups, and stakeholders involved, as well as\nunique technical and governance barriers.\nThus, the three technologies were addressed and\nassessed separately as well.\nApplication of Water Saving Technologies,\nsuch as Drip or Subsurface Irrigation\nTechnology\nThe ambition for said technologies was set as\na target: “Increase the irrigated areas in the\nJordan Valley and Highlands using water saving\ntechnologies to 60,000 hectares by 2030”. The\nambition also extends to expanding water\nharvesting activities to the catchments of dry areas\nand the Badia region to deliver socio-economic\nand environmental benefits in the arable areas.\nTo that end, the following actions are proposed\nfor this technology:\nn\nn Improving agricultural extension services\nsignificantly to provide necessary advisory\nservices and capacity building activities on\nthe advantages of the technology;\nn\nn Developing capacity building campaigns\ntargeting farmers;\nn\nn Providing economic incentives and subsidized\ntariffs for water saving irrigation practices in\norder to increase efficient use by land-owners\nand farmers;\nFarm-level Water Harvesting\nThe scale and ambition for this technology is\ncentered in local catchments in dry areas and the\nBadia region. Thus, among the actions proposed\nfor this technology are:\nn\nn Implementation\nof\npilot\nprojects\nto\ndemonstrate\nthe\nadvantages\nof\nthe\ntechnology;\nn\nn Enabling provision of long-term and lowinterest loans or grants through state\nfunds, private sources (different banks), and\ninternational funds (WB, IFAD, GEF, GCF,\nAdaptation Fund); and\nn\nn Supporting the creation of a stakeholder\nnetwork for the development and transfer\nof the technology through a network of\ntechnical experts.\nIntroduction (or Promotion) of Plant\nVarieties Resistant (Adaptive) to Climate\nChange\nThe scale of application for this technology will\nbe restricted to rain-fed agricultural areas, where\ncereal-legume cropping systems are predominant.\nTherefore, the following actions are proposed for\nthis technology:\nn\nn Establishing modern breeding programs to\nproduce climate change resilient varieties\nin collaboration with multinational and\ninternational organizations;\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n149\nn\nn Developing specific subsidy mechanisms\nand incentives to the farmers to promote the\nutilization and dissemination of the climate\nchange resilient crop varieties;\nn\nn Strengthening institutional capacity; and\nn\nn Promoting knowledge transfer and increasing\npublic awareness regarding the benefits of\nimproved varieties.\n5.5 Financial Resources Needs\nAccording to the National Environmental and\nEconomic Development Study for Climate Change\n(NEEDS) study published in Jordan in 2010, both\nmitigation and adaptation measures in Jordan will\nrequire substantial financial resources. The study\nestimates that USD 3.5 billion will be needed for\nmitigation until 2020. With only 0.5% of the public\nbudget allocated to projects in the environmental\nsector (apart from infrastructure investments in\nwater and energy), considerable fundraising\ntargets are required.\nThe Government of Jordan has proposed sectoral\nmitigation policies and programs to achieve a 14%\nreduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared\nto the baseline scenario. The 14% reduction of\nGHG emissions is divided into two parts. The first\npart seeks to achieve a 1.5% reduction in GHG\nemissions through unilateral actions, while the\nremaining 12.5% reduction is contingent and\nconditional on receiving international financial\nsupport. In its INDCs, Jordan put the estimate of\nreducing GHG emissions by 14% at USD 5.7 billion.\nTo finance mitigation measures in the energy\nsector, Jordan will require USD 5,158 million to\nmeet its conditional mitigation targets. While a\nsignificant proportion of this is likely to come from\ninternational sources of finance, one of the key\nsectoral actions for the energy sector is attracting\nprivate sector finance and reducing administrative\nobstacles in order to enable JREEEF to support\ninvestments at early stages.\nThe key challenges in financing climate\nchange projects, particularly EE and RE\nn\nn Banks in Jordan, in general, are interested\nin providing finance to RE and EE projects.\nBanks prefer financing RE projects, particularly\nthose which are of a larger size and linked to\ntheir existing client base. EE and smaller sized\nprojects are less preferred.\nn\nn To minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity.\nn\nn There is a lack of appropriate financial\nproducts.\nn\nn Project developers lack technical capacity.\nThe work of public financing institutions, such as\nJREEEF and JEF, although small scale, could play a\ncrucial role in promoting early stage investments,\nparticularly for public private partnership (PPP)\nprojects, and for projects with co-financing.\nThe Jordan Environment Fund (JEF) lacked the\nneeded financial and administrate autonomy to\nbe able to carry out its mandate effectively and\nefficiently. JREEEF is now active and has full and\nadequate institutional, technical, and financial\ncapacity to manage the fund, buttressed by a\nmanagement committee, supportive legislation\n(JREEEF By-Law), a transparent and effective\ngovernance structure, a strategic business plan,\nand financial support windows. For JEF to fund\nmitigation activities will require a widening of\nits current role to include a specific focus on\nmitigation activity, and the development of\nproject selection criteria including an assessment\nof projects’ impact on GHG emissions. In addition,\nJEF currently lacks adequate human, technical, and\nfinancial capability to perform its current role, let\nalone an expanded role.\nThe majority of financial resources pumped into\nenvironmental sectors in Jordan come from donor\ncountries through bilateral agreements that\nfocus on fiscal and developmental challenges\nin the country. Framework agreements and\nstrategies with major donors like UNDP, USAID,\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n150\nEU, GIZ, JICA, and other agencies have been\ndeveloped and address a variety of sustainable\ndevelopment objectives. The donor community\nis supportive of a public registry of projects which\nwould allow transparency and coordination of\nongoing activities, as well as the assessment of\ntheir cost effectiveness. In addition, these donors\nare particularly supportive of developing strong\nGHG MRV frameworks, believed to be key to\ndemonstrating the effectiveness climate financing.\nFinancial institutions and banks are interested in\nentering this new sector. Several green loans\nand programs are being established and green\nsuppliers and manufacturers are growing in\nnumber. However, the market lacks proactive\nmarketing and public outreach.\nCurrently, there is 112 million JD available for RE\nand EE financing in Jordan. Of this amount, 76\nmillion JD is available through the four commercial\nbanks using the Central Bank of Jordan’s window\nfor RE and EE, and 36 million JD is available through\nthe Agence Français de Development (AFD)\nfacility. Key challenges in disbursing these funds\ninclude the lack of credible market references and\na short credit history. This is particularly a relatively\nnew field and while some banks have already\nestablished designated credit lines, other banks\nare still on the fence. A particular challenge for\nthem is the lack of sufficient knowledge to verify\nproject assumptions, technologies, or risks. They\nneed access to an independent, credible reference\nbody for the accreditation of RE and EE projects.\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps\nand needs:\nn\nn As part of the FBUR project, a framework for\na domestic MRV system for Received Support\nwas suggested that addresses most of the\nabove gaps, constrains, and needs by:\nØEstablishing a dedicated entity to oversee\ncollecting and verifying received support\ninformation related to climate change.\nØDesigning and implementing a national\nmulti-level MRV system, supported by the\nPartnership for Market Readiness.\nn\nn It is recommended top raise the capacities\nof stakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects.\nn\nn It is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment.\n5.6 Financial and Technical Support\nProvided by GEF Related to Climate\nChange\nThe Global Environment Facility (GEF) supported\nJordan financially in executing the following\nclimate change activities:\nn\nn Preparation\nof\nthe\nInitial\nNational\nCommunication (INC), prepared by the\nGeneral\nCorporation\nfor\nEnvironment\nProtection (GCEP) (which later became the\nMinistry\nof\nEnvironment),\n1996-1997.\nn\nn",

NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East, and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\na variety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative areas\nor governorates. The governorates are subdivided\ninto districts and sub-districts, and within each\ngovernorate there are several municipalities.\nIn order to organise the environmental and\nclimate change institutional set up, the Ministry\nof Environment was established in 2003 to\noversee all environmental affairs. Since then,\nJordan has undergone a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. Based on the\nrecommendations of this policy, the Ministry of\nEnvironment revised the Environment Protection\nLaw, no.52 of 2006 to include and strengthen the\narticles of the law related to climate change. The\nnew Environment Protection Law no.6 of year\n2017, includes provisions on climate change goals\nwhich later enabled the Ministry to develop the\nClimate Change Bylaw no.79, 2019 which aims\nmainly to regulate the coordination of national\nefforts among relevant stakeholders to implement\nmitigation and adaptation measures.\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural\nresources, a high population growth rate, the\nongoing regional conflicts, the rising cost of health\ncare and the growing expectations of people, have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable\nsocial and economic development.\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy. The Ministry\nof Energy and Mineral Resources has recently\npublished the National Energy Sector Strategy for\n2020-2030. This ten-year plan which aims at setting\nthe roadmap to increase self-sufficiency through\nutilization of domestic natural and renewable\nresources, as well as expansion of existing energy\ndevelopments, thus reducing reliance on costly\nforeign fuel imports that burden its economy.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy identified\nrenewable energy usage alongside other sources\nas follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share,\nfollowed by household, industrial and other\nservice sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share\nrespectively.\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable water\nresources. While Jordan’s population is expected to\nincrease as a result of natural population growth,\nthe country has also experienced population\ngrowth due to the influx of multiple waves of\nrefugees putting additional strain on Jordan’s\nalready severely limited water resources.\n\n3\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot, and\ndry summers and short, cool winters. The climate\nis influenced by the country’s location between\nthe aridity of the Arabian Desert and the humidity\nof the eastern Mediterranean area. January is\nthe coldest month, with average temperatures\nranging from 5°C to 10°C, while August is the\nhottest month with average temperatures ranging\nfrom 20°C to 35°C. Rainfall varies from season to\nseason and from year to year. However, about\n75% of the country can be described as having a\ndesert climate with less than 200 millimeters of\nrain annually. About 70% of the average rainfall in\nthe country falls between November and March,\nwhile the period from June to August is often\nwithout rain. However during the last ten years,\nJordan has been witnessing variations in seasons\nand average temperatures.\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions: the Highlands and Marginal\nSteppes where most of the rain-fed farming is\npracticed, the eastern desert (the badia) and the\nlowlands (Jordan Valley).\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. The\nvast majority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, Pine and Juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners, and are found mostly in\nthe northern part of Jordan where higher rainfall\nprevails. These include natural forest vegetation\nand tree plantations on farms, in the form of\nwindbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\nTransportation infrastructure in Jordan is\nconsidered to be relatively well developed within\nthe Middle East. The estimated annual growth in\ndemand for transportation and logistics ranges\nfrom 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s transportation\nand logistics sector plays a key role in Jordan’s\neconomy and contributes over 8.2% of GDP.\nLand and air transportation infrastructure is\nwell developed, with plans to improve maritime\nand railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages. Currently,\ntransportation is considered to be very energy\ninefficient, using almost half of the final energy\nconsumption of Jordan.\nJordan experiences a relatively high growth rate\nin private cars of approximately 5% per year which\nexceeds the estimated population growth. Public\ntransport (PT) in general is not well organized and\nlacks the infrastructure and interchanges required\nfor a comfortable journey. There are few mode\nchoices for PT, compared to other countries, and\nthis has led to its low share of trips. The majority of\ntrips in Jordan are made by private car. There has\nbeen some growth in the numbers of hybrid and\nelectric cars. However, in 2018, hybrid and electric\ncars still made up less than a quarter of the private\ncars in Jordan. A low share of trips are also carried\nout using regular taxis. A new innovation is the\nuse of ride-hailing apps. Their effect on mobility\nhas yet to be studied in Jordan.\n\n4\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhas improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of municipal solid waste (MSW) over\ntime. Preliminary official estimates refer to more\nthan 20-35% increase in solid waste generation\nin Jordan following the Syrian crisis, putting a\nsubstantial burden on municipalities as well as\non the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste is collected from 100 municipalities and\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km to\nthe East of Amman over an area of 2,000 Dunums,\nenough to dispose waste until 2035. In 1989, the\nGovernment of Jordan selected Swaqa landfill,\n125 km to the South-East of Amman, as a facility\nto process hazardous waste.\n2. NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for\nthe year 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines\nand the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines. The estimation of the overall national\ninventory was carried out using the 2006 IPCC\nInventory Software for non-Annex I Parties. The\nsectors and subsectors that were considered are\nthe Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use\n(IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU) and Waste.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nin units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by source and removal by sink. Indirect\nGHGs were estimated, whenever the activity data\nwere available, using the EEA Guidelines and\nmethodology.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC SAR were used.\nThe overall GHG Inventory estimates for Jordan in\n2016 were 31,063.32 Gg of CO2-equivalent (CO2eq).\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the energy sector was\nthe major emitter releasing around 76% of total\nnational emissions followed by the waste sector\nwith a contribution of around 12%.\n Energy sector\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016. Fugitive\nemissions (from oil and natural gas) were\nnegligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with a share of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture) accounted each for 10% and 10 % of\nthe total respectively.\n\n5\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n Industrial processes and product use\n(IPPU) sector\nEmissions from the industrial processes sector\nwere 3,177.42 Gg of CO2eq accounting for\n10% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016.\nThe industrial processes sector was a source of\nNMVOCs emissions and accounted for 32.61 Gg in\n2016. In addition to CO2 and NMVOCs, the sector\ngenerated emissions of HFCs with 757.29 Gg of\nCO2eq in 2016.\n Agriculture, forestry and other land use\nchange sector\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016. The emissions were\ncomposed of methane and nitrous oxide and were\ngenerated by various subcategories.\n Waste sector\nGHG emissions from the waste sector reached\n3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for 12% of\nJordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3,559.01 Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions in\n2016, while wastewater handling accounted for\n5% (188.40Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\n GHG Inventory by gas\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nresulted from the energy sector accounting\nfor 95% followed by 9% from the IPPU sector.\nMethane emissions were highest from the\nwaste sector followed by the AFOLU sector with\ncontributions of 70% and 17%, respectively.\nNitrous oxide emissions were highest from the\nAFOLU sector with 57%, followed by the IPPU,\nenergy and waste sectors, with contributions of\n18%, 13% and 12%, respectively. As expected, the\nIPPU sector contributed 100% of HFCs while the\nNMVOCs emissions resulted from the IPPU and\nthe energy sectors.\nWithin the energy sector, the main emissions\nwere in the form of CO2 (97%). Within the IPPU\nsector, the key GHGs were CO2 followed by HFCs\nwith shares of 69% and 24%, respectively. Nitrous\noxide emissions were highest from the AFOLU\nsector, with around 57% mainly from fertilizers\nand manure management. Methane emissions\nwere highest from the waste sector, with 78% and\nproduced from solid waste management.\nGHG emissions (+) and removals (-) in Gg CO2eq by Gas and by Sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\nCH4\nN2O\nHFCs\nSF6\n(Gg)\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nTotal national\nemissions and\nremovals\n24,385.37\n4,675.49\n1,245.14\n757.29\n0.022\nEnergy\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\nNA\nNO\nIPPU\n2,194.88\n0.00\n225.22\n757.29\n0.022\nAFOLU\n-896.76\n614.62\n710.85\nNA, NO\nNO\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\nNA\nNO\n\n6\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n3. GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nUpdate of the FBUR baseline scenario: the\nbaseline scenario was updated for all economic\nsectors of energy, industry, agriculture and forestry\nin addition to the waste sector, based on the\nstrategies, policies and plans prevailing in the\nJordanian context during the time of preparation\nof this SBUR (2020). This requires a projection\nof the current levels to future levels for each\ntype of activity. The newly released strategies,\npolicies, action plans and committed projects\nwere reviewed and summarized. In addition,\nall projects and actions that were part of FBUR\nbaseline scenario were reviewed to update their\nstatus. Based on this review, the most probable\nfuture trends in activities that will impact and\nshape the GHG emissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n Jordan 2025, Vision and National Strategy,\nissued in May 2015.\n The new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n The\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August 2020,\n The new Solid Waste Management Framework\nLaw issued in March 2020 and entered into\nforce in September 2020,\n National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020), issued\nin 2018,\n Jordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in\n2016.\nUpdate of FBUR GHG mitigation measures: All\nmitigation projects were reviewed and assessed\nto identify all those still valid. These projects\nstill considered valid have been updated after\nadjustments were made to their expected\nimplementation timeline. The emission reduction\nand the unit cost of emission reduction for each\nmitigation project have been recalculated taking\ninto consideration several factors, such as the\nimprovement in technologies and changes in\nprices. Net present value was used in the financial\ncalculations, by converting all present and future\nrevenues and costs over the project’s lifetime to\na base of today’s cost. The same approach was\nfollowed in calculating the CO2eq emissions\nreduction over the lifetime of the mitigation\nprojects. A discount cost of 8% was used for both\nthe cost and emission reduction calculations. Also,\nthe discounted unit cost of reduced emission\nreduction was calculated as the quotient of the\ndiscounted cost in JD to the discounted emissions\nin tonnes of CO2.\nThe update of FBUR mitigation projects resulted in\n23 valid GHG mitigation projects identified within\nthe primary energy, renewable energy, energy\nefficiency, industry, domestic solid waste and\nwastewater, and agriculture and forestry sectors\nand subsectors.

The findings indicated that in particular\nthe projects related to energy efficiency should\nreceive the most attention.

DOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING,\nAND VERIFICATION\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its market readiness proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\nProposal (PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined\na plan for implementing the market readiness\ncomponents that will be necessary to support\nthe development of appropriate market based\ninstruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n A National MRV system and registry for climate\nmitigation measures,\n Designing a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n Exploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith the development of a multi-tiered integrated\nMRV system. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE). Adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors will serve in tracking progress\ntowards NDC commitments.\n5. UPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND\nRELATED NEEDS\nThe following are some recommendations for\nthe successful implementation of the climate\nchange bylaw no 79/2019, through support of\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to this bylaw:\n It is recommended that the MoEnv as chair\nof the NCCC clarify and continually stress the\nrole of different ministries and institutions in\nthe area of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n Seek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe, committee and the technical groups,\nformed according to the climate change bylaw,\nin areas relevant to their roles,\n It is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at least\n3 years) to be able to strengthen their work\nand it’s highly recommended to prepare their\nsuccessors in advance,\n Climate change directorates at different\nministries and institutions are important\nvehicles to mainstream climate change into\nthe strategies and policies of their respective\ninstitutions. As such, it is recommended that\nthe MoEnv coordinates continuously with these\ndepartments and supports them in identifying\ntheir capacity building needs.\nJordan’s FBUR to the UNFCCC was prepared and\nsubmitted in late 2017. After its submission, a\nTeam of Technical Experts (TTE) was tasked with\nits review. These experts were trained to conduct\nreviews as part of the ICA according to Decision\n2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s FBUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify the capacity-building\nneeds of developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NC’s:\n\n9\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series,\nb. Develop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources,\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis,\nd. Develop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and emission\nfactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis,\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct ongoing\nsurveys to provide accurate data and to\nintegrate climate change questions in existing\nenergy surveys that mainly focus on energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng. Enhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh. Enhance technical capacity to report on mitigation\nactions that are already implemented or\nongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress and the\nunderlying steps envisaged for the planned\nmitigation actions and when they will be\nimplemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\nIn terms of financial resources needs; the key\nchallenges in financing climate change projects\nare summarized as follows:\n Due to the Corona pandemic and its negative\neffects on health, the economy and society, it\nis expected that financial support from donors\nwill be directed to the health sector to mitigate\nthe effects of this pandemic, and this may\nnegatively affect the availability of the required\nsupport from international bodies or public\nbudgets at the national level to implement\nprojects to protect the environment in general\nand climate change projects in particular,\n Lack of climate finance framework (policy or\nstrategy),\n Banks in Jordan, in general, are interested\nin providing finance to renewable energy\nand energy efficiency projects. Banks prefer\nfinancing RE projects, particularly those which\nare of a larger size and linked to their existing\nclient base. EE and smaller sized projects are\nless preferred,\n To minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n There is a lack of appropriate financial products,\n Project developers lack technical capacity.\n\n10\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps and\nneeds:\n Expansion of the framework for the MRV system\nfor received support that addresses most of\nthe above gaps, constraints, and needs by\nestablishing a dedicated entity to oversee\ncollecting and verifying received support\ninformation related to climate change,\n Strengthen the ability to develop bankable and\nevidence-based projects,\n It is recommended to raise the capacities of\nstakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects,\n It is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment,\n Enhance the partnership between the public\nand private sector.\n \n\n11\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRoman Theater\n\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1\n1.1\nLocation and Climate\n14\n1.2\nGovernance Structure\n15\n1.3\nThe Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n15\n1.4\nSocial Indicators\n16\n1.5\nEconomic Context\n18\n1.6\nEnergy Profile\n19\n1.7\nWater Resources\n22\n1.8\nAgriculture and Forestry\n25\n1.9\nTransportation\n26\n1.10 Industry\n31\n1.11 Waste Management\n31\nReferences\n33\n\n14\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThis\nchapter\ndescribes\nJordan’s\nnational\ncircumstances that are related directly and\nindirectly to climate change.\nThe following sections will be covered:\n Location and Climate\n Governance Structure\n The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n Social Indicators\n Economical Context\n Energy Profile\n Water Resources\n Agriculture and Forestry\n Transportation\n Industry\n Waste Management\n1.1 Location and Climate\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\nvariety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot,\nand dry summers and short, cool winters. The\nclimate is influenced by the country’s location\nbetween the aridity of the Arabian Desert and\nthe humidity of the eastern Mediterranean area.\nJanuary is the coldest month, with average\ntemperatures ranging from 5°C to 10°C, while\nAugust is the hottest month with average\ntemperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C.  Rainfall\nvaries from season to season and from year to\nyear. However, about 75% of the country can be\ndescribed as having a desert climate with less than\n200 millimeters of rain annually. About 70% of\nthe average rainfall in the country falls between\nNovember and March, while June through August\nare often rainless. However during the last ten\nyears, Jordan has been witnessing changes in\nseasons and average temperatures.\nJordan can be divided into three main geographic\nand climatic areas: the Jordan Valley, the Mountain\nHeights Plateau, and the Eastern Desert, or Badia\nregion. The Jordan Valley has the country’s most\ndistinctive natural terrain. The northern segment\nof the Jordan Valley, known in Arabic as the\nGhor, is the most fertile region. Several degrees\nwarmer than the rest of the country, its year-round\nagricultural climate, fertile soils, higher winter\nrainfall, and extensive summer irrigation have\nmade the Ghor the food basket of Jordan. The\nJordan Valley is the location of the Jordan River\nwhich extends from the northern border down\nto the Dead Sea.\nThe Mountain Heights Plateau is the highlands\nof Jordan. It extends through the entire length\nof the western part of the country and separates\nthe Jordan Valley and its margins from the plains\nof the eastern desert. These areas receive Jordan’s\nhighest rainfall, and are the most richly vegetated\nin the country. This region hosts most of Jordan’s\npopulation centres, including the cities of Amman,\nMadaba, Zarqa, Irbid, and Karak.\nThe Eastern Desert or Badia Region comprises\naround 75% of Jordan. This area of desert and\ndesert steppe is part of what is known as the\nNorth Arab Desert. It stretches into Syria, Iraq, and\nSaudi Arabia, with elevations varying between 600\nand 900 meters above sea level. Climate in the\nBadia varies widely between day and night, and\nbetween summer and winter. Daytime summer\ntemperatures can exceed 40°C, while winter\nnights can be very cold, dry, and windy. Rainfall is\nminimal throughout the year, averaging less than\n50 millimeters annually. Although the regions of\nthe Badia (or desert) have common harsh desert\nclimate, similar vegetation, and sparse population\nconcentrations, those regions vary considerably\naccording to their geology.\n\n15\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.2 Governance Structure\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a\nconstitutional monarchy with a representative\ngovernment. Jordan is divided into twelve\nadministrative areas or Governorates (Figure\n1.1). Each Governorate is managed by a Governor\nwho is designated by the Cabinet based on the\nrecommendation of the Minister of Interior.\nFigure 1.1: The twelve governorates of Jordan.\nThe Governorates are subdivided into districts, subdistricts, and chief towns and these are managed by\ncivil servants of the Ministry of Interior, whose task\nis to coordinate and supervise the decentralized\nservices of other ministries under the authority\nof the Governor. Within governorates there are\nseveral municipalities, the Law of 1955 defines the\nMunicipality as being “A financially independent\nnational institution”, having a “legal personality”\nand an administrative autonomy, which is managed\nby the town council that is composed of the Mayor\nand 6 to 11 councilors.\n1.3 The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\nThe Ministry of Environment was established\nin 2003 to oversee all environmental affairs.\nSince then the country has witnessed a steady\nexpansion of the legal and institutional framework\nfor environmental protection. The Ministry of\nEnvironment became the focal point for all\ninternational environmental conventions including\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC).\nJordan is undergoing a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. The policy\nprovides guidance to sector strategies from a\n\n16\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTable 1.1: Social indicators\nclimate change perspective, and it provides a\nframework for coordination of climate change\nactivities at the national level.\nBased on the recommendations of this policy, the\nMinistry of Environment revised the Environment\nProtection Law, no.52 of 2006 to add new articles\nrelated to climate change and strengthen the\nexisting articles. The new Environment Protection\nLaw no.6 of year 2017, includes provisions on\nclimate change goals which later enabled the\nministry to develop the climate change bylaw\nno.79, 2019.\nThe climate change bylaw aims to regulate;\n(a) the coordination of national efforts among\nrelevant stakeholders to implement mitigation\nand adaptation measures, (b) the development\nof a legislative framework that maps out plans to\ncombat climate change in the Kingdom and ways\nto implement them, (c) the streaming of climate\nchange into national plans and the implementation\nof the goals and principles of the UNFCCC and the\nParis Agreement. According to the bylaw, a highlevel committee is established under the name\n“National Committee on Climate Change” which\nis chaired by the Minister of Environment and\nconsists of 16 high-level members from relevant\npublic authorities. Its functions and powers are\nidentified within the bylaw including the power\nto form technical teams from governmental and\nnon-governmental agencies represented by\ncivil society institutions, research institutions,\nuniversities and the private sector institutions.\nThe teams are mainly tasked with supporting the\nMoEnv with the NDC, the national adaptation plan\nand any other reports that should be prepared\nwithin Jordan’s international commitments and\nassessing the capacity-building needs of relevant\nentities related to climate change and contributing\nto the implementation of awareness-raising and\ncapacity-building activities.\n1.4 Social Indicators\nThe following table summarizes the main\nsocial indicators in Jordan; including the main\ndemographic data for the Jordanian population,\nrefugees and education and health indicators.\nPopulation (end of year 2019)\n10,554,000\nMale\n5,588,000\nFemale\n4,966,000\nUrban ( 90.3% )\n9,529.200\nRural ( 9.7% )\n1,024,800\nAge less than 14 years\n34.4 %\nAge between (20-45) years\n39 %\nPopulation Growth Rate\nFor years (1952- 1979)\n4.8%\nFor years (1994-2004)\n2.6%\nFor years (2004-2015)\n5.3%\n\n17\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe average household income (DOS, 2017 and 2018)\n11,242 JD\nAverage annual income for female-headed households\n9,534 JD\nAverage annual income for male-headed households\n11,519 JD\nThe gender pay gap\n17%\nThe female participation in the Jordanian labor market (World Bank,\n2020)\n15%\nHouseholds Headed by Female (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (agricultural land)\n44%\nOwn livestock\n30%\nHouseholds Headed by Male (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (Agricultural land)\n68%\nOwn livestock\n36%\nRefugees (registered as refugees) to End of Year 2019\n755,050\nRoughly Annual Cost providing for refugees (JRP, 2018)\n2.9 Billion JD = 8% of GDP\nParticipation from International Community (%) (JRP, 2018)\n5.5%\nSyrian refugees (UNHCR,2019)\n664,226\nIn urban areas\n80%\nIn (Al Za,Atari, Mrajeeb Al-farhood, Cyper City and Al-Azraq ) Camps\n20%\nEducation in Jordan (DOS,2017)\nIlliteracy rate for those above 15 years old (DOS,2017)\n5.1%\nExpenditures on education (% of GDP)\n3.6%\nHealth Indicators\nTotal annual expenditure per capita (WHO,2014)\n798 USD\nExpenditures (% of GDP) (WHO,2014)\n7.5%\nLife expectancy (DOS,2017)\n73.5\nInfant mortality rate per 1000 capita (UN, 2019)\n14\nCrude birth rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n21.5\nCrude death rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n3.9\nSource: DOS, 2019 unless otherwise indicated\n\n18\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe national accounts statistics published in 2019\nby the Central Bank of Jordan and the Department\nof Statistics (DOS) showed that there was an\nimprovement in GDP per capita at existing prices\nin 2018 while the GDP growth rate decreased.\nTable 1.3 shows the national statistics and the\npercentage of the main contributing sectors to\nGDP along the last five years (2014-2018).\n1.5 Economic Context\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural resources,\na high population growth rate, the ongoing\nregional conflicts, the rising cost of health care,\nand the growing expectations of people have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable social\nand economic development. Jordan’s economic\nindicators are illustrated in Table 1.2.\nTable 1.2: Economic indicators\nGeneral Socio-Economic Indicators for 2018\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices\n30,482 Million JD\nGDP at constant prices\n29,474 Million JD\nAnnual Growth Rates of GDP at Current Prices\n3.7%\nAnnual Growth Rates of GDP at constant Prices\n1.9%\nCompensation Annual Growth Rates of employees as a percentage of GDP\n39.0%\nGovernment final consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP at\ncurrent prices\n17.1 %\nGross Fixed Capital formation out of GDP at current prices\n20.4%\nExport of goods and services out of GDP at current prices\n35.1%\nImports of goods and services out of GDP at current prices\n53.0 %\nLabor Market Indicators for 2018 (MoL,2018)\nLabor Force (persons above the age of 15)\n1,734,248\nMales Economically Active\n56.4%\nFemales Economically Active\n15.4%\nUnemployed Males\n16.5%\nUnemployed Females\n26.8%\n\n19\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTable 1.3: National accounts statistics\nIndictors\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nGDP at Current Market Prices (million JD)\n(2016=100)\n25,595.8\n26,925.1\n27,829.6\n28,903.4\n29,984.2\nGDP at Constant Market Prices (million JD)\n(2016=100)\n26,579.7\n27,265.4\n27,829.6\n28,418.4\n28,969.8\nGDP Growth Rate at Current Market Prices (%)\n7.2\n5.2\n3.4\n3.9\n3.7\nGDP Growth Rate at Constant Market Prices (%)\n3.4\n2.6\n2.1\n2.1\n1.9\nEconomic Activity contribution (%) to GDP\nManufacturing\n16.7\n16.5\n16.4\n16.2\n17.9\nWholesale and Retail Trade, Restaurants, and\nHotels\n10.1\n9.9\n9.9\n9.8\n9.4\nTransport, Storage, and Communications\n14.4\n14.5\n14.7\n14.8\n16.5\nFinance, Insurance, and Business Services\n9.7\n9.9\n8\n8.1\n8.4\nAll categories of the 2017 budget, including\ndomestic revenues, foreign grants, current\nexpenditure, and capital expenditure, showed a\ndecline compared with the year before. The sharp\ndrop in foreign grants from 700 million JD in 2018\ncompared to 1,236.5 million JD in 2014, came as a\nshock, as Jordan depends heavily on foreign grants\nto finance its capital expenditure. The consolidated\nbudget deficit for the central government and\ngovernment owned units reached 694.8 million\nJD in 2017, compared to 825.9 million JD within\nthe same period of 2016.\nOutstanding external public debt (government\nand government guaranteed) decreased by\n2.6% to reach 11,560 million JD at the end of the\nsecond quarter of the year 2018, which represents\na decrease in the percentage to GDP from 41.7% at\nthe end of 2017 to 39.8% by the end of the second\nquarter of 2018. (MOF, 2018).\nIn contrast, net domestic debt balance increased\nby 10.6% reaching 15,005 million JD in the same\nperiod, net domestic debt as percent of GDP was\n51.6 % by the end of the second quarter of 2018\ncompared to 47.7% of GDP at the end of 2017.\nThe increase of net domestic debt was a result of\nincreasing net outstanding budgetary debt by\n1,359 million JD and increasing net outstanding\ndebt of NEPCO and WAJ by 77 million JD.\n\nThe net outstanding public debt increased by 4.4%\nfrom its level at the end of 2017, reaching about\n26,564 million JD, and representing 91.4% of the\nestimated GDP for 2018.\n1.6 Energy Profile\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy (MEMR, 2019).\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\n\n20\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe Strategy, which assumes 2018 as base year, predicts the changes in contribution of different energy\nsources in electricity generation between 2020 and 2030 as illustrated in the following charts.\nFigure 1.2: The National Energy Strategy (2020-2030) forecast for electricity generation\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the nationally\ndetermined contributions (NDCs) target by 2030.\nThe total renewable capacity by the end of 2018\nwas 1,130 MW and expected to reach 2,400 MW\nby the end of 2020, accounting for 20% of the\ngenerated electricity, compared to 1% in 2014\n(MEMR, 2018).\nIn 2014, a legislative and regulatory framework for\nrenewable energy has been set up by enacting a\nspecial renewable energy law as well as developing\nthe needed bylaws and instructions, which promote\nrenewable energy through financial incentives. As\na result, many renewable energy power purchase\nagreements were signed to supply the grid with\nelectricity generated from solar and wind. Many of\nthese projects became operational in 2015.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share followed\nby household, industrial and other services sectors\nwith 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share respectively.\nFigure (1.3) shows the final energy consumption\nin Jordan by sector for the year 2018.\n\n21\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe interruption of the Egyptian gas supply forced\nthe Jordanian government to look for new sources\nof natural gas. The construction of a Liquefied\nNatural Gas (LNG) jetty project at Aqaba port,\nthe connection to the Arab gas pipeline, and the\nleasing of a Floating Storage and Regasification\nUnit (FSRU) were successfully implemented and\nput into commercial operation in September\n2015. In 2018, 88.8% of electricity generated in\nthe Kingdom was based on imported natural\ngas. Eventually, Jordan will develop the ability to\nmeet all its needs for natural gas: for electricity\ngeneration and for industrial use.\nJordan possesses one of the largest oil shale\nreserves in\nthe\nworld with total\ndeposits\nestimated at 70 billion tonnes, containing more\nthan seven billion tonnes of oils. It is planned\nthat by 2020, 470 MW of electric generating\ncapacity will be under operation from the Attarat\nOil shale project signed in 2014 (MEMR, 2018).\nThe Attarat Power Plant is an oil shale-fueled\npower plant under construction in the Attarat\nUm Ghudran area, 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of\nAl Qatranah in Jordan.\nThis project is being developed by the Attarat\nPower Company (APCO) (which is a partnership\nbetween YTL Power International (45%), Guangdong\nYudean Group (45%) and Eesti Energia (%10)),\nto be the first oil shale fired power station and\nopen cast mine to commercially utilize Jordan’s oil\nshale. APCO has entered into a -30 year agreement\nwith NEPCO for the sale of the entire electrical\ncapacity and net electrical output following\nconstruction of the power station. The power\nplant will have 554 MW gross and 477 MW net\ncapacity and it will consist of two circulatingfluidized-bed units. It is expected to meet 10-15%\nof Jordan´s annual power demand. \nAdditionally, Jordan has developed a strategy for\nutilizing nuclear power to supply the country with\n30% of its demand for electricity by 2030, with\nsurplus destined for export. A nuclear power\ncommittee was set up in 2007 and a law was\nenacted to establish the Jordan Atomic Energy\nCommission (JAEC) and the Jordan Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (JNRC). In December\n2016, JAEC in cooperation with a consortium\nheaded by the Korean Atomic Energy Research\nFigure 1.3: Energy consumption per sector, 2018\n\n* Others: Commercial and agricultural sectors along with streetlight. Source: MEMR, 2019\n*\n\n22\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nInstitute inaugurated the 5 MW Jordan Research\nand Training Reactor. The facility is the first nuclear\nreactor in the county. It will provide radioactive\nisotopes for medical applications in Jordan, and\nwill provide training for students at the Jordan\nUniversity of Science and Technology to prepare\na skilled workforce for the country’s planned\ncommercial nuclear power reactors.\nThe country was aiming to have two 1,000 MW\nnuclear power units in operation by 2025, by the\nRosatom Company, but is now considering the use\nof small modular reactors (SMRs) instead which\nseems to be the more appropriate in bridging the\ngap in the Jordanian electricity generation mix.\n1.7 Water Resources\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable\nwater resources (MWI, 2017). While Jordan’s\npopulation is expected to increase as a result of\nnatural population growth, the country has also\nexperienced population growth due to the influx\nof multiple waves of refugees putting additional\nstrain on Jordan’s already severely limited water\nresources.\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for Municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses, as indicated by Figure 1.4.\nAccording to 2017 figures, about 46% of the\nagricultural demand is met by groundwater\nresources and the rest is met by surface and\ntreated water, as shown in Table 1.4 (MWI, 2017).\nThe majority of irrigated land in Jordan is located\nFigure 1.4: Water use by sector, 2017\n\n23\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nin the highlands and desert areas (about 52,700\nhectares), and in the Jordan Valley (about 31,600\nhectares).\nAbout 72% of the water supply for domestic uses\nis met by groundwater sources. The potable water\ninfrastructure in Jordan is not very efficient. The\nwater loss was estimated as 48% in 2017 compared\nto 43% in 2010, divided into more than 50% as\nadministrative loss and less than 50% as physical\nloss from the networks. (MWI, 2017)\nAbout 85% of the industrial demand is met by\ngroundwater resources. It is worth noting that\nindustrial water demand is projected to increase,\ndue to anticipated expansion in industrial\nenterprises as a result of Jordan’s inclusion in the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), the free trade\nagreements signed between Jordan and the\nUnited States, and the establishment of free zones\nin different regions of Jordan. These agreements\nmake Jordan a desirable destination for regional\ninvestors and manufacturers.\nWater Source\nSector\nTotal\n (MCM)\nPercentage\nof the total\nDomestic\nIndustrial\nAgriculture\nGroundwater\n338.4\n27.2\n253.2\n618.8\n59 %\nSurface water\n131.3\n2.4\n154.4\n288.1\n27 %\nTreated Wastewater\n0\n2.5\n144.2\n146.7\n14 %\nTotal\n469.7\n32.1\n551.8\n1,053.6\n100 %\nPercentage of the total\n45%\n3%\n52%\n100%\nSource: MWI, 2017\nTable 1.4: Water sources for different sectors\nGroundwater contributes about 59% to the total\nwater supply. Of the twelve major groundwater\nbasins, ten are over-extracted. Increasing overall\nwater extraction to meet national needs carries a\nhigh cost. Jordan is now accessing nonrenewable\nwater resources from fossilized deep-water\naquifers. Underground water from the nonrenewable Disi aquifer (about 100 MCM) is being\nused to meet Jordan’s water supply for domestic\nuse, while treated wastewater (147 MCM) is being\nused mostly to meet the country’s agricultural\nneeds (MWI, 2017). Surface water supplies account\nfor 27% of Jordan’s total water supply estimated\nas 288.1 MCM in 2017.\nJordan’s population was 10.3 million in 2018\nand it is expected to reach 19 million by 2050\nunder business-as-usual scenario (DOS, 2018). The\nproportion of water used for domestic purposes\nmay increase by 50-60% in the same time period.\nBy 2025, water demand will exceed available water\nresources by more than 26%, but this deficit is\nprojected to decline to 6% when the Red SeaDead Sea project is put into operation (MWI, 2016).\nWater shortage in Jordan is a chronic problem and\nwill continue to be so for years to come. If current\ndomestic, agricultural, and industrial water-use\npractices are not improved, the water supply in\nJordan will deplete in quantity and quality over\ntime. Overdraft of groundwater and surface water\nis creating a tremendous stress on the water\nsupply in Jordan. The reduced flow of surface\nwater to the Dead Sea is also a source of concern.\nDespite Jordan’s severe water scarcity, more\nthan 94% of Jordanians have access to safe\ndrinking water and 65% have access to improved\nsanitation. These are some of the highest rates\nin the Middle East and North Africa region.\nHowever, water supply is intermittent, and the\nrooftop tanks have become an integral part of\nthe supply water storage system. Around 50% of\nJordanians are supplied by water once a week\n(24 hours) while the rest are supplied by a higher\nrate (more than 24 hours per week) (MWI, 2017).\nSince the Disi-Amman Conveyor Project became\n\n24\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\noperational in the summer of 2013, the continuity\nof water supply to Amman has improved. However,\npopulation centres in the northern governorates\nhave not benefitted fully because of increased\ndemand driven by the concentration of Syrian\nrefugees in the north. Aqaba has continuous\nwater supply from the Disi Aquifer. It is planned\nto bridge the remaining gap between demand and\nsupply through increased use of non-conventional\nwater including reclaimed water and desalinated\nseawater to be provided by the Red Sea-Dead\nSea project in the near future. The National Water\nStrategy emphasizes desalination as well as treated\nwastewater reuse to meet shortfalls in freshwater\navailability (MWI, 2017).\nThe Jordan National Water Strategy 2016-2025 has\nidentified treated wastewater, when mixed with\nsurface water, as a source of irrigation water. In\n2017, the amount of treated wastewater exceeded\n163 MCM. There are 33 public working wastewater\ntreatment plants in Jordan, most of which use\nactivated sludge. They are either operated by the\nWater Authority of Jordan (WAJ) or managed by\nthe Project Management Unit (PMU) at the Ministry\nof Water and Irrigation (MWI) through contracts\nwith the private sector. The Samra Wastewater\nTreatment Plant (WWTP) receives more than 70%\nof the country’s total generated wastewater.\nAccording to MWI figures, the ratio of industrial\nto total water use in 2017 was very small (5.2%).\nIndustrial wastewater discharged to wadis and\nother surface water bodies was first regulated by\nMartial Law issued in 1981, to force all industries\nto treat their wastewater before discharge to\nreceiving water bodies. A number of industrial\nentities divert their wastewater to the public sewer\nsystem according to WAJ regulation No. 18/1998.\n\n25\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.8 Agriculture and Forestry\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions with various landscape\nclassification (Figure 1.5) among which: the\nhighlands and marginal steppes where most of\nthe rain-fed farming is practiced, the Badia (deserts\nand rangeland; mostly livestock systems and\nsome cultivation in watersheds and from deep\nbore irrigation), and the lowlands (Jordan Valley)\nthat thinly stretches from the North West to the\nSouth West.\nFigure 1.5: Preliminary Landscape classification (Created by Natalia BOULAD, 2019)\n\n26\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. In\naddition, the agro-industrial sector is characterized\nby a large number of small enterprises. The vast\nmajority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables. More than 90%\nof irrigated areas in Jordan are dedicated to the\ncultivation of fruit trees and vegetables.\nTable 1.5: Indicators of agricultural sector\nSocio-economic Indicators for Agriculture in Jordan\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n20%\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 2018 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n6.1%\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n57 Million JD\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n1,687.9 Million\nJD\n% of active employees\n1.7%\nNon-Jordanian workers holding work permits in Agriculture in 2017 (DOS,2017)\n81,691\nNumber of Males\n79,685\nNumber of Females\n2006\nAgricultural product exports are a significant\ncontributor to Jordan’s overall export profile;\nstrong productivity and competitiveness of the\nsector are clearly shown despite its relatively\nsmall contribution of 6.1% to the country’s GDP.\nThe Jordanian agriculture exports represented\napproximately 18% of Jordan’s exports (or US$ 6.2\nbillion) in 2016. Exporting agricultural produce has\nbeen affected by the conflict in Syria, causing a\nsevere decline of around 25% as well as disrupting\noverland exports to other markets (Oxford Business\nGroup, 2015).\nAgriculture is mostly influenced by water\navailability and the ability to use advanced\npractices, technologies, and interventions to adapt\nto the impacts of climate change. Over the past two\ndecades, Jordan has witnessed a drastic drop in\nrainfall and prolonged drought periods. According\nto Jordan’s Third National Communication (TNC)\nreport outcomes, it is projected to witness a\ndecrease in precipitation by 15-60% and a rise\nof 1-4°C in temperatures. These climatic changes\nwill have serious negative consequences on\nnatural ecosystems, river basins, watersheds, and\nbiodiversity.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, pine and juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners and are found mostly\nin the northern part of Jordan where higher\nrainfall is prevailing. They include natural forest\nvegetation and tree plantations on farms, in the\nform of windbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\n1.9 Transportation\nTransportation is a key sector for Jordan, providing\na necessary service to promote economic growth.\nCurrently it is considered to be very energy\ninefficient (ACT Alliance repot, 2018), using\nalmost half of the final energy consumption of\nJordan (MEMR Brochure, 2019). The estimated\nannual growth in demand for transportation and\nlogistics ranges from 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s\n\n27\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\ntransportation and logistics sector plays a key role\nin Jordan’s economy and contributes over 8.2% of\nGDP. (Jordan Investment Commission, 2017). Land,\nmaritime and air transportation infrastructure\nare well developed, and there are plans to\ndevelop railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages.\nToday, there is an extensive 80,000 square kilometers\nroad network which spans across the Kingdom,\nconnecting it with neighboring countries.\nThere is no regular passenger rail in the country.\nThe Hejaz railway which runs the length of the\ncountry from north to south, has not been used for\nmany years and would need extensive renovation,\nto be put back into operation. The service from\nAmman to Syria was halted about 10 years ago,\nand the only passenger railway trips are for ondemand tourist trips travelling from Amman to\nJiza, a short distance to the south of the city.\nThe Kingdom serves as an important regional\ntransport\nhub between\nGulf\nCooperation\nCouncil (GCC) countries and Turkey and Europe,\nand also between Iraq and the Red Sea and\nthe Mediterranean. \nThere are three airports in Jordan: Queen Alia\nInternational Airport (QAIA), the main airport, and\nAmman Civil Airport, both in Amman Governorate\nand King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nThe only scheduled internal flights are passenger\nflights between QAIA and Aqaba.\nThe port city of Aqaba, on the Red Sea, provides\nthe only gateway to shipping for the country and\nis therefore an important centre for freight.\nAdditionally, the transport sector in the inventories\nof 2012 and 2016 was estimated to have\ncontributed to 26% and 28% respectively of the\ngreenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest\nemitter after the energy industries (electricity\ngeneration). The available national inventories,\nshow that the share of emissions for the transport\nsector are rising at an increasing rate, and that\nthe share of emissions within the inventories are\nrising, see table below.\nYear\n2006\n2010\n2012\n2016\nTransport Emissions Gg/CO2\n4,706\n5,297\n7,392\n8,787\n% of National GHG Emissions\n16\n23\n26\n28\nSource: TNC and BURs.\nTable 1.6: Transport GHG emissions from national inventories\nThe majority of trips in Jordan are made by private\ncars as indicated in the modal split in table 1.7. The\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) estimated this to be\n35% of trips for 2010, based on household surveys\nand this was backed up by the household survey\ncarried out in Amman in 2008, which estimated that\n33% of trips were made by private car. It is expected\nthat these percentages will have increased since\nthese surveys were carried out.

(GAM,\n2010)\nThere has been some growth in the numbers of\nhybrid and electric cars. However, their popularity\nis strongly dependent on government policy,\nwhich until now has not been consistent. In 2018,\nhybrid and electric cars still made up less than a\nquarter of the private cars in Jordan, as shown in\nthe table below.\n \nGasoline\nHybrid\nElectric\nTotal\nNo of Vehicles\n892,875\n244,080\n16,017\n1,153,271\n% of Vehicles\n77.4\n21.2\n1.4\n100\nSource: DOS, 2014-2018\nPublic transport (PT) in general is not well organized\nand lacks the infrastructure and interchanges\nrequired for a comfortable journey. There are few\nmode choices for PT, compared to other countries,\nthe available modes being: large bus, minibus and\nshared taxis (running on fixed routes). There is also\na lack of accessibility – with the coverage of PT\nservices in Jordan below the international average.\nIn general PT is considered suitable only for those\nwith no other option and this has led to its low\nshare of trips.\nThere is even lower share of trips carried out\nusing regular taxis, although these are not\ngenerally available outside of main centres. A\nnew innovation is the use of ride-hailing apps and\nseveral companies notably Uber and Careem, have\nbecome very popular after initial licensing issues\nwere resolved.\nAs a consequence of the introduction of ridehailing apps, a law was issued in 2017, which\nprohibits anyone from providing services relating\nto the transportation of passengers without\nTable 1.8: Number of private cars by fuel type in 2018\nA law has been passed that any new gas station,\nmust also provide electric charging points.\nHowever, until now, charging stations have not\nbeen provided in sufficient numbers to encourage\nthe uptake of electric vehicles. Currently there are\nonly around 50 charging stations for the whole\ncountry, and an agreement signed with German\nCompany e-Charge in 2018 to provide 10,000\nElectric vehicles (EV) charging stations has not yet\nbeen implemented. (Electromaps, 2020)\nThe uptake of electric cars has been slow and they\ncurrently make up only 1% of the private cars in\nJordan. As can be seen in the table below most\nof these are in Amman, although the numbers\nincreased sharply in 2019 in Zarqa and Irbid.\nTable 1.9: Electric cars registered in Amman and in Jordan\n\n29\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nbeing registered and licensed with the Land\nTransport Regulatory Commission (LTRC). Within\nthis framework, two regulations were issued in\n2018, which allowed for the complete licensing\nand registration of companies using ride-hailing\napplications: the Regulation concerning the\nTransportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications and the Instructions Regulating\nthe Transportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications.\nThere are currently about 12,500 vehicles in Jordan\nlicensed for use with ride hailing apps. Their effect\non mobility has not yet been studied in Jordan, so\nit is not clear whether trips are shifting from regular\ntaxi, public transport or private car or whether they\nare enabling “untapped demand”, trips that would\nnot otherwise be made.\nUber and Careem cars have the advantage of not\ntaking up space for parking. In fact difficulty of\nfinding parking is one reason why people may\nchoose to use their services. Additionally, since\nthey do not circulate looking for rides, there are\nexpected to be reductions in congestion, fuel\nconsumption and emissions, compared to regular\ntaxis.\nConcerning freight, the current modes used for\ntransport for imports and exports are by truck,\nplane, ship and pipeline. Truck is the most versatile,\nwith the most clearance points. Air freight is\ntransported through the three airports in Amman\nand Aqaba and shipping freight is transported\nthough Aqaba Port. Pipelines are used for import\nof natural gas through Aqaba.\nThe table 1.10 below shows the amount of\ntransported freight by weight, by mode and year.\nThere are no clear trends in the data.\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n8,840\n7,357\n6,977\n7,250\n8,564\nPlanes\n67\n76\n79\n83\n73\nShip\n21,075\n21,316\n23,361\n22,506\n20,998\nPipeline\n229\n234\n0\n0\n419\nTotal\n30,212\n28,982\n30,417\n29,839\n30,054\nIn the table below the percentage, by weight,\ntransported by each mode are compared. It can\nbe seen that the most important mode for freight\ntransport is ship, although this has been decreasing\nover the last few years. The second most important\nmode is truck, which has shown a corresponding\nincrease over the last few years. The share of freight,\nby weight, transported by plane and by pipeline,\nis minimal.\nTable 1.10: Freight transported by mode (gross weight in 1000 tonnes)\nTable 1.11: Freight transported by mode in %\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n29\n25\n23\n24\n28\nPlanes\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nShip\n70\n74\n77\n75\n70\nPipeline\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\nTotal\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n\n30\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nGovernance and Structure of the Transportation\nSector\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No.89, 2003. MoT is responsible\nfor developing the transport general policies and\nstrategies and supervising their implementation in\ncoordination and collaboration with the relevant\nentities. It is also responsible for regulating and\nmonitoring both public and freight transport. MoT\ncedes its responsibilities concerning planning and\nimplementation of transport to two organizations\nin different areas of Jordan. These are Greater\nAmman Municipality (GAM) and Aqaba Special\nEconomic Zone Authority (ASEZA).\nMinistry of Transport carries out its responsibilities\nin coordination with the related Government\norganizations described below:\n Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission (CARC)\nwas established in 2007 to replace the Civil\nAviation Authority (CAA) in accordance with\narticle 68 of the civil aviation law number 41\nof 2007. The function of CARC is to regulate\nall affairs pertaining to civil aviation including\nsafety, security, economic and environmental\naspects,\n The Transport Regulatory Commission- In July\n2020 the cabinet agreed to combine three\ntransport organizations into the Transport\nRegulatory\nCommission.\nThese\nformer\norganizations are: Land Transport Regulatory\nCommission (LTRC), the Jordan Maritime\nCommission (JMC) and the Jordan-Hejaz Railway\nCorporation,\n The Land Transport Regulatory Commission was\nestablished in 2010 to take over from the former\nPublic Transport Regulatory Commission (PTRC),\nbut with additional responsibility for freight\ntransport, by road. Its function is to regulate\nand monitor land transport and services, and\nits institutional objectives include: increasing\noperational efficiency of PT services, improving\nmobility of urban and rural populations and the\ndevelopment of environmentally sustainable PT\nservices,\n Jordan Maritime Commission (JMC) was\nestablished by royal decree in 2002 under the\ntitle of Jordan Maritime Authority. The name was\nrevised to JMC in 2014. JMC operates under the\nJordan Maritime Authority Law No. (46) Issued\nin 2006. Its function is to regulate, supervise and\ndevelop the maritime sector,\n The Jordan-Hejaz Railway Corporation was\nestablished in 1952, and it manages and\ninvests in the properties of the railway between\nMa’an and the Syrian border. It was used for\ntransporting freight between Jordan and Syria\nup until services were stopped about 10 years\nago as a result of the conflict in Syria.\nGreater Amman Municipality which has almost\n40% of the population of Jordan is responsible for\nall PT taking place completely inside its borders, an\narea of 800 km2. This responsibility was assumed\nin 2007 based on a law granting the municipality,\nplanning and regulatory authorities over PT. The\nintegrated Transportation and Traffic Management\nDirectorate was established shortly after this, to\nbring together these newly granted roles with\nGAM’s existing traffic engineering functions.\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA)\nwas created in 2001, within the Aqaba Governorate\nas a separate governance entity, covering an area\nof 375 km2 around the port city of Aqaba, including\nJordan’s entire 27 km marine coastline. ASEZA\nhas held responsibility for PT within the Aqaba\nMunicipality and between Amman and Aqaba\nsince 2000. ASEZA is also responsible for the port\nareas, the King Hussein International Airport and\nthe section of the Hejaz Railway between Aqaba\nand Ma’an and the additional link to the phosphate\nmines.\n\n31\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nMinistry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH)\nundertakes the construction and development\nof the network of roads in the country and is\nresponsible for setting plans and preparing the\nstudies and designs necessary for their construction.\nIn addition, they undertake tasks assigned by the\nGovernment of Jordan. A similar role is carried\nout within Greater Amman Municipality by the\nDepartment of Public Works and Housing within\nGAM and in Aqaba by the Department of Public\nWorks within ASEZA.\n1.10 Industry\nJordan is attractive for foreign investments in the\nMiddle East primarily due to its political stability\nand its central location in the region. Industry in\nJordan is principally dominated by manufacturing\nand mining.\nQualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) are business parks\nthat are recognized as free trade zones set up in\ncollaboration with the United States. Jordan is\none of two countries to have this arrangement,\nthe other being Egypt.\nIn Jordan, the Qualified Industrial Zones are:\n Al-Hassan Industrial Estate,\n Al-Hussein Ibn Abdullah II Industrial Estate,\n Jordan Industrial Estate Corporation,\n Jordan Cyber City,\n Al-Tajamouat Industrial Estate,\n Gateway QIZ,\n Aqaba Industrial Estate,\n Ad-Dulayl Industrial Park,\n El-Zai Ready-wear Manufacturing Company.\nThe manufacturing sector includes leather and\nfootwear manufacturing, chemicals, plastics, IT,\nfurniture, food, packaging, and manufacturing\nof engineering technology. The contribution of\nmanufacturing to GDP increased to 1347 million\nJD in the second quarter of 2019 from 1208.80 JD\nMillion in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining industry sector is one of the most\nimportant strategic industries. Mining contributes\nto the employment of local labor and caters to the\nneeds of the market for raw materials, while being\na source of hard currency.\nThe contribution of mining to GDP increased to\n175 million JD in the second quarter of 2019 from\n162.8 million JD in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining sector consists of the following subsectors:\n Phosphate and potash,\n Cement and chalk mining,\n Mining and extraction of limestone to produce\ncalcium carbonate,\n Mining and manufacturing kaolin, gypsum, and\nsilica,\n Extracting and crushing stone tablets, slabs,\nmarble, and granite stones and sand.\nPhosphate and potash are the most significant\nnatural resources in Jordan. The sector relies\nprimarily on large investments, driving several\nfirms to invest in such a promising field. The\nmining sector is the third largest industrial sector\nin terms of invested capital and the fourth largest\nsector in terms of exports in 2014. It also ranked\nfirst in terms of foreign investments in Jordan.\nMoreover, products from mining are used as\nraw material inputs for other industries such as\nfertilizers. Positive outlooks loom large as domestic\nvalue-added activities are increasingly combined\nwith investing in other areas, such as shale oil and\nuranium. This requires activating the exploitation\nof untapped raw materials in the Kingdom to\ncreate products that meet the global demand\nfor energy.      \n1.11 Waste Management\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of a high\npopulation growth rate and enforced migration.\nEconomic and cultural development has improved\nthe standard of living and changed consumer\nhabits, resulting in an increase in the volume of\nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) over time. No official\n\n32\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nstatistics have been disclosed regarding the\nincrease in solid waste generation after the influx\nof Syrian refugees. However, preliminary official\nestimates refer to more than 20-35% increase\nin solid waste generation in Jordan following\nthe Syrian crisis, putting a substantial burden\non municipalities as well as on the surrounding\necosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste collected from 100 municipalities is then\ntransported to transfer stations, sanitary landfills\nor open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded landfills\nin the country, most of which are not properly\ndesigned or operated, demonstrated by their lack\nof proper lining, leachate collection system, and\nlandfill gas management system. The only sanitary\nlandfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which receives 50%\nof the waste produced in Amman and Zarqa. AlGhabawi landfill is located 23 km to the East of\nAmman over an area of 2,000 Dunums, enough to\ndispose waste until 2035, using safe refuse/tipping\ntechniques. The Greater Amman Municipality\npurchased 1,000 Dunums from surrounding lands\nto rent out to the private sector to encourage\ninvestment in waste segregation and recycling.\nIn 1989, the Government of Jordan designated\nSwaqa landfill, 125 km to the South-East of\nAmman, as a facility to process hazardous\nwaste. The landfill is overseen and operated\nby the Ministry of Environment. The Ministry of\nEnvironment has also founded a centre in Swaqa\nlandfill to oversee the disposal of electronic waste\nin a safe manner to discourage improper storage\nand illegal re-selling. In general, the sector is in\nneed of studies to investigate the potential of\nwaste recycling.\nIt’s important to note that Bio-waste (organic\nwaste) dominates MSW; approximately 60% are\nfood waste, 14% paper and cardboards, 10%\nplastics. Therefore, MSW contains sufficient\nputrescible material which emit LFG (methane\n& CO2) for many years presenting a long-term\nexplosive and toxic hazard. Additionally, hazardous\nand non-MSW are not segregated and continue\nto reach final disposal sites posing serious health\nrisks for workers.\nIn Jordan, 48% of MSW is landfilled, 45% is\nopenly dumped and only 7% recycled. As a\nmatter of fact, recycling is mostly done by waste\npickers informally with no operational facility in\nplace. Furthermore, it is estimated that in 2034,\nMSW will reach 5.2 million tonnes (EC, 2016).\nConsidering these foreseeable challenges, in 2015\nthe Government of Jordan took a step forward\nwith the Decision No. 11392/02, and approved\nits first National Solid Waste Management\nStrategy 2015-2034 (NSWMS) in line with the\nrevised EU Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/\nEC which focuses on waste prevention and with\nthe EU-Jordan Compact 2016-2020 which sets\nthe sustainable use and management of natural\nresources as one of its priorities. The Strategy’s\nmain objective is to renovate the old, inefficient,\ncostly and environmentally unstable municipal\nsolid waste management system and convert it to\na modern and integrated one using the Three R’s\napproach (Reduce-Reuse-Recycle) within a span\nof 20 years. In particular, it seeks to prohibit the\nunsafe disposal of MSW and omit the disposal\nof industrial, construction, and medical wastes\nfrom facilities. In numeric-terms, 50% of existing\ndumpsites should be closed and 20 new transfer\nstations plus 10 new sanitary landfills should be\nconstructed (NSWMS, 2015).\n\n33\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nNo.\nSubject of Target\nProposed Targets for Jordan\nShort-term\nPeriod (20152019)\nMid-term\nPeriod (20202024)\nLong-term\nPeriod (20252034)\n1\nCatering for the emergency needs for\nMSWM due to the refugees’ influx\nDone\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n2\nCoverage of MSW street-cleaning and\ncollection services\n100%\n3\nSet-up of separate collection systems for\nrecyclables (at least paper, metal, plastic\nand glass)\n-\n100 % by 2034\n4\nPreparing for re-use and recycling of\nMSW materials (at least paper, metal,\nplastic and glass)\n-\n50% by weight\nby 2034\n5\nCease of operation of uncontrolled or\nunlicensed disposal sites\n50% by 2019\n100% by 2024\n6\nReduction of bio-waste ending-up to\nlandfills\n-\n75% by weight\nby 2034\n(according to\n2024 amounts)\n7\nRecovery of packaging waste (including\nreuse, materials’ recovery and energy\nrecovery)\n-\n25% by weight\nby 2034\n8\nRecycling of packaging waste\n-\n15% by weight\nby 2034\nReferences\n Ben-Sasson, M., Brenner, S., and Paldor, N.

Other gases\nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, such\nas sulphur oxides (SOx), included in the IPCC\nGuidelines may be included at the discretion\nof the Parties.\nThe GHG national inventory chapter addresses\nemissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide\n(N2O), methane (CH4), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons\n(PFCs). Those gases are supported by the\nsoftware and the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines. Nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)\nemissions resulting from the solvents subsector\nwere estimated using European Monitoring and\nEvaluation Programme (EMEP/EEA) air pollutant\nemission inventory guidebook 2019.\n2.2 Institutional Arrangements\nThe Ministry of Environment is the focal point for\nissues relevant to the UNFCCC and is responsible\nfor ensuring that Jordan’s commitments are met.\nPreparation of Jordan’s Second Biennial Update\nReport (SBUR) was coordinated by the Ministry of\nEnvironment in partnership with UNDP.\nAn agreement with the Royal Scientific Society\n(a national non-governmental, not-for-profit\nscientific organization) was realized to achieve\nthe work. The GHG inventory development was\naccomplished with the participation of a pool of\nnational experts representing different national\nentities, as demonstrated by the organizational\nchart in Figure 2.1.\n\n39\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.1: GHG inventory organizational chart\n\n40\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.3 Methodology and Inventory Estimation\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for the\nyears 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines and\nthe 2019 Refinement1 to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\nThe estimation of the overall national inventory\nwas carried out using the IPCC Inventory Software\nfor Parties not included in Annex I of the UNFCCC\n(ver. 2.691, released on 23 January 2020).\nThe sectors and subsectors that were considered\nare the following:\n1.\tEnergy:\n Stationary Combustion,\n Mobile Combustion,\n Fugitive Emissions.\n2.\tIndustrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU):\n Mineral Industry Emissions,\n Chemical Industry Emissions,\n Metal Industry Emissions,\n Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent\nUse,\n Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for Ozone\nDepleting Substances and Other Product\nManufacture and Use.\n3.\tAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU):\n Cropland and Forest Land,\n Emissions from Livestock and Manure\nManagement,\n N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2\nEmissions from Lime and Urea Application.\n4.\tWaste Generation, Composition, and\nManagement Data:\n Solid Waste Disposal,\n Biological Treatment of Solid Waste,\n Incineration and Open Burning of Waste,\n Wastewater Treatment and Discharge.\nIn May 2019 at IPCC 49th Session, the 2019\nRefinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories was adopted\nby the IPCC in Kyoto, Japan (Decision IPCC-XLIX-9).\nThe IPCC authors have examined a wide range\nof inventory methodologies and updated them,\nwhere scientific advances and new knowledge\nmade this necessary, following the IPCC decision.\nThe 2019 Refinement does not revise the 2006\nGuidelines, but updates, supplements and/or\nelaborates the 2006 Guidelines where gaps or\nout of date science have been identified. It will\nnot replace the 2006 Guidelines, and should be\nused in conjunction with the 2006 Guidelines.\nThe structure of 2019 Refinement is the same\nstructure as that of the 2006 Guidelines to make\nit easier for inventory compilers to use the 2019\nRefinement with the 2006 Guidelines. It includes\nan Overview Chapter and five volumes (General\nGuidance and Reporting (GGR), Energy, IPPU,\nAgriculture, AFOLU and Waste). The changes are\nindicated in each volume as Annex “Mapping\ntable” listing the types of refinements that have\nbeen done on the volume.\nIn brief, the main changes that were introduced\nto the different volumes are as follows:\n In Volume 1, adding a new guidance to all\nchapters,\n In Volume 2, introducing methodological issues\nin the stationary combustion and in the fugitive\nemissions chapters; adding new section for fuel\ntransformation and updating emission factors.\nAdditionally, updating the worksheet of the oil\nand natural gas systems,\n In volume 3, including updates for the emission\nfactors, and adding a new section for hydrogen\nproduction,\n In Volume 4, developing new guidance,\nupdating carbon stock change factors and\ndeveloping a new tier 2 method that requires\nless activity data than the current default\nmethod.\n1. All updates, supplements and/or elaborates on the 2006\nGuidelines were identified and adopted in this chapter.\n\n41\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n Finally, in volume 5, updating the default data,\nupdating the wastewater treatment chapter\nto reflect additional types of treatment and\ndisposal systems.\nThe guidance on appropriate estimation methods\nwithin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines that includes\ncross-sectoral good practice guidance for\ninventory preparation were consulted. It includes\nmethods for collection of activity data, key\ncategory analysis, quality assurance and control,\nand inventory planning and documentation.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nand in units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by sources and removals by sinks. Most\nsectors and subsectors used Tier 1.\nIndirect GHGs were estimated, whenever the\nactivity data were available, using the EMEP\nGuidelines and methodology.\nFor reporting purposes, the notation keys NO\n(not occurring) or NE (not estimated) and NA\n(not applicable) were used as necessary in the\ninventory reporting tables.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC Second Assessment Report\n(SAR) temporal horizon 100 years were used. The\nfollowing sections report Jordan’s GHG inventories\nby sector and on a gas by gas basis.\n2.4 GHG Inventories by Sector\nAccording to the overall GHG Inventory estimates,\nJordan contributed 31,063.32 Gg of CO2eq in 2016.\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the Energy Sector is the\nmajor emitter accounting for around 76% of\ntotal national emissions followed by the Waste\nSector with a contribution of around 12%. GHG\nemissions by sector in 2016 are shown in Table\n2.1 and Figure 2.2.\nTable 2.1: GHG aggregate emissions in Gg CO2eq by sector, 2016\nCategories\nEmissions\nGg CO2 eq\nPercentage of the\noverall\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n31,063.32\n100%\nEnergy\n23,649.47\n76.13%\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use\n3,177.42\n10.23%\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n428.71\n1.38%\nWaste\n3,807.73\n12.26%\n\n42\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.2: GHG aggregate emissions (%) by sector, 2016\nIn the sections below, a detailed description is\ngiven for the emissions resulting from the sectors\nin year 2016.\n2.4.1 Energy sector\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP and\nplacing a strain on its economy (MEMR, 2019). The\nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the NDCs\ntarget by 2030. The total renewable capacity by\nthe end of 2018 was 1,130 MW and was expected\nto reach 2,400 MW by the end of 2020, accounting\nfor 20% of the generated electricity, compared\nto 1% in 2014 (MEMR, 2018). The largest energy\nconsumer in 2018 was the transport sector with a\n49% share followed by household, industrial and\nother services sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14%\nshare respectively.\n\n43\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nEnergy-related activities have a dominant share\nof GHG emissions in Jordan. Emissions from this\nsector are classified into two main categories:\n Emissions from fuel combustion,\n Non-combustion (fugitive) emissions.\nGHGs Emissions in 2016\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016, resulting primarily\nfrom fuel combustion activities, as shown in Table\n2.2. Fugitive emissions (from oil and natural gas)\nwere negligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with shares of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial,\nand Agriculture) accounted for 10% and 10%\nrespectively of the total, as indicated in Figure 2.3.\nTable 2.2: Energy sector aggregated emissions, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\nCH4\nN2O\nAggregated\nemissions in\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nGg\nGg of CO2 eq\nENERGY SECTOR\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\n23,649.47\nFuel Combustion Activities\n23,032.67\n60.10\n155.39\n23,248.15\nEnergy Industries\n8,956.12\n4.35\n9.12\n8,969.59\nManufacturing Industries and Construction\n2,432.06\n1.41\n7.01\n2,440.47\nTransport\n8,609.48\n43.73\n133.50\n8,786.71\nOther Sectors (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture)\n2,354.95\n8.88\n4.40\n2,368.23\nNon-Specified\n680.06\n1.73\n1.36\n683.15\nFugitive emissions (Oil and Natural Gas)\n21.92\n379.29\n0.10\n401.31\nFigure 2.3: Shares of emission (%) per subsector within the energy sector, 2016\n\n44\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nInternational Bunkers, 2016\nAs per Decision 17/CP, to the extent possible, and\nif data are available, non-Annex I Parties should\nreport emissions from international aviation and\ninternational water-borne navigation separately\nin their inventories. Emission estimates from these\nsources should not be included in the national\ntotals and should be reported only as information\nitems.

The emissions were\ngenerated mainly from:\n Mineral Industry (mainly cement production),\n Products used as substitutes for Ozone Depleting\nSubstances (ODS) (mainly Refrigeration, Air\nConditioning, and Fire Protection),\n The Chemicals Industry (mainly Nitric Acid\nproduction Subsectors.\nThe IPPU sector was a source of NMVOCs emissions\nand accounted for 32.61 Gg. In addition to CO2\nand NMVOCs, the sector generated emissions of\nHFCs with 757.29 Gg of CO2eq.

The southern and eastern parts of the\ncountry are arid with hot dry summers and cold\ndry winters. Temperature increases towards the\nsouth, with exceptions in some southern highlands.\nPrecipitation is extremely variable and is confined\nlargely to the winter and early spring seasons. It\nranges from over 500mm in the highlands to less\nthan 50mm in the east. The long-term average\nannual precipitation is 8,317 million cubic meters,\nof which, about 92.5% is lost to evaporation. The\nEastern Desert (also known as the Badia) that\nlies east of the mountainous region and covers\nabout 80% of the land area of Jordan has a low\nprecipitation (the Updated Rangeland Strategy\nfor Jordan, 2014).\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture 2018\nstatistical report, cultivated land accounts for (2.32.8 million dunums). On average, irrigated areas\ncomprise around 1 million dunums (60% of the\ncultivated areas), whereas on average rainfed areas\nmake up around 1.5 million dunums (40% of the\ncultivated areas).\nThe contribution of agriculture to the GDP, in\nrelative terms, declined sharply from 40% in\nthe 1950s to 4.8% in 2018. Irrespective of how\nhumble the contribution of agriculture is to GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of the agricultural\nsector stems from the fact that it is not only a major\nsource of food, particularly dairy products, fruits\nand vegetables, but it is also a source of livelihood\nfor around 25-30% of the total poor population\n(livestock keepers, smallholder farm households,\nand landless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas (World Bank- Technical Note, 2018).\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016, acting as a net\nemission source. The emissions were composed\nof methane and nitrous oxide and were generated\nby various subcategories. AFOLU emissions and\nremovals are shown in Table 2.6 and Figure 2.5.\n\n47\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.6: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nNet\n(Gg CO2 eq)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nAgriculture, Forestry, and\nOther Land Use\n-896.76\n614.6\n710.9\n428.71\nLivestock\nNA\n610\n20.44\n630.45\nLand\n-922.54\nNA\nNA\n-922.54\nAggregate sources and nonCO2 emissions sources on land\n25.78\n4.611\n690.4\n720.80\nFigure 2.5: Emissions of the AFOLU sector (Gg CO2eq), 2016\n2.4.4 Waste sector\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhave improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of MSW over time. No official statistics\nhave been disclosed regarding the increase in\nsolid waste generation after the influx of Syrian\nrefugees. However, preliminary official estimates\nrefer to more than a 20-35% increase in solid waste\ngeneration in Jordan following the Syrian crisis,\nputting a substantial burden on municipalities as\nwell as on the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan.\nSolid waste collected from 100 municipalities\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km\nto the east of Amman, and covers an area of over\n2,000 Dunums, enough to dispose waste until 2035,\nusing safe refuse/tipping techniques. Additionally,\nGg CO2eq\n\n48\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nthe Greater Amman Municipality purchased 1,000\ndunums from surrounding lands to rent out to the\nprivate sector to encourage investment in waste\nsegregation and recycling.\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nIn 2016, GHG emissions from the waste sector\nreached 3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for\n12% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3559.01 Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions,\nwhile wastewater handling accounted for 5%\n(188.40Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\nTable 2.7 and Figure 2.6 show 2016 emissions\nbreakdown by the waste sector.\nTable 2.7: Emissions of the waste sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nTotal CO2eq\n(Gg)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\n3807.73\nSolid Waste Disposal\nNA\n3,559.01\nNA\n3,559.01\nIncineration and Open Burning of Waste\n32.66\n23.11\n4.56\n60.32\nWastewater Treatment and Discharge\nNA\n39.38\n149.02\n188.40\nFigure 2.6: Emissions (%) by the waste sector, 2016\n\n49\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.5 GHG Inventory by Gas\n2.5.1 GHG Emissions in 2016\nThe share of carbon dioxide was the largest with a contribution of 24,385.37 Gg, accounting for 79%\nof all GHGs emissions, followed by CH4 with a contribution of 4,675.49 Gg of CO2eq at only 15%, as\nindicated in Figure 2.7.\nFigure 2.7: National emissions (%) by gas, 2016\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nwere produced by the energy sector accounting for\n95%, followed by 9% from the IPPU sector.

This approach\nprovides estimates of CO2 to compare with\nestimates derived using a Sectoral Approach. The\nReference Approach provides an upper bound\nto the Sectoral Approach ‘1A Fuel Combustion’,\nbecause some of the carbon in the fuel is not\ncombusted but is released as fugitive emissions\n(as leakage or evaporation in the production\nand/or transformation stage). Calculating CO2\nemissions with the two approaches can lead to\ndifferent results for some countries.\nThe Reference Approach was used to calculate\nenergy sector emissions in 2016 and the results\nwere compared to those of the Sectoral Approach.\nThe gap between the two approaches should\nbe relatively small (5% or less). For Jordan, the\ncalculated differences were acceptable; less than\n5%, as indicated in Table 2.11.\nTable 2.11: Reference approach vs sectoral approach for the year 2016\nYear\nReference Approach\nSectoral\nDifference\nCO2 Emissions (Gg)\n%\n2016\n24,017.75\n23,043.18\n4.23\nGHG emissions were also estimated using the\nReference Approach for the time series (2013-2016)\n(Table 2.12 and Figure 2.9).\nThe outcomes indicated a steady increase in\nthe energy consumption for 2013-2016, and\nan unexpected decrease in 2015 emissions was\nnoticed which was due to a change in the energy\nmix of electricity generation in the form of using\nnatural gas a less carbon intense fuel than Diesel.\nTable 2.12: Energy consumption and emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\nYear\nEnergy Consumption (TJ)\nCO2 (Gg)\n2013\n317,581.57\n22,772.64\n2014\n327,784.75\n24,136.90\n2015\n345,185.21\n23,936.91\n2016\n379,660.75\n24,017.75\n\n55\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.9: Variations in emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\n2.8 Time Series and Comparison between\nCurrent and Previous Inventories\nThe time series is a central component of the\ngreenhouse gas inventory because it provides\ninformation on historical emissions trends and\ntracks the effects of strategies to reduce emissions\nat the national level. As is the case with estimates for\nindividual years, emission trends should be neither\nover nor underestimated as far as can be judged.\nAll emissions estimates in a time series should be\nestimated consistently, which means that as far\nas possible, the time series should be calculated\nusing the same method and data sources in all\nyears. Using different methods and data in a time\nseries could introduce bias because the estimated\nemission trend will reflect not only real changes\nin emissions or removals but also the pattern of\nmethodological refinements. Chapter five, volume\none of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was consulted\nin terms of good practices ensuring time series\nconsistency.\nRecalculations were carried out for the years\n2010 and 2012. Also, techniques for combining\nor “splicing” different methods or data sets to\ncompensate for incomplete or missing data were\nused for estimating years the 2000 and 2006.\nFigure 2.10 and Table 2.13 provides an overview\nof time series estimation:\n As expected, an increase in GHG emissions\nwas noticed between the different years due\nto population growth and increased economic\nactivities,\n The category 1.B - Fugitive emissions from fuels\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 were recalculated\nusing the correct emissions factor for onshore\n- developing country and this resulted in new\nfigures (from 1.02 and 1.26 Gg CO2eq to 235.98\nGg CO2eq and 336.75 Gg CO2eq respectively),\n Also, the 2.D - Non-Energy Products from Fuels\nand Solvent Use category was recalculated\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 due to an error in\nemission factor unit conversion. Results were\nmodified from 208.80 Gg CO2eq and 226.88 Gg\nCO2eq to 2.85 Gg CO2eq and 3.09 Gg CO2eq,\n All sectors for 1994 will be calculated as part of\nthe third BUR. Collecting data was challenging\ndue to difficulties in getting the activity data in\ndue time,\n The IPPU and AFOLU sectors for the years\n2000 and 2006 were not estimated due to\ndifficulties in getting the activity data in due\ntime. Recalculation will be carried out as part\nof the third BUR.\n\n56\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.10: Comparison between time series for the energy and the waste sectors\nThe above figure illustrates a comparison between\nthe energy and waste sectors for the years of 2000,\n2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016.

Non-Annex I Parties are\nencouraged (Decision 17/CP.8), to the extent\npossible, to undertake any key category analysis\nto assist in developing inventories that better\nreflect their national circumstances. The analysis\nwas carried out based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines\nand Software. Jordan used “level” key category\nanalysis where the contribution of each source or\nsink category to the total national inventory level\nwas calculated. The key categories according to the\nguidelines are those that, when summed together\nin descending order of magnitude, add up to 95%\nof the sum of all level assessment.\nIn categories that are identified as key, parties\nshould try to use a recommended method, in\naccordance with the corresponding decision tree\nin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It is recommended\nthat Jordan searches for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to the\nextent possible and based on software readiness\nand national circumstances, Tier 2 methods in the\ncategories identified as key.\nAs shown in Table 2.14 for the year 2016, the key\ncategory analysis resulted in thirteen subcategories;\nthe top four accounting for around 64.9% of all\nemissions, were:\n Fuel Combustion Activities subcategories:\nEnergy Industries (Gaseous Fuels), Road\nTransportation, Energy Industries (Liquid Fuels),\nand other sectors (commercial/institutional and\nresidential-Liquid Fuels),\n The solid waste management subcategory.\n\n58\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.14: Key category analysis (level assessment), 2016\nA\nB\nC\nD\nF\nG\nIPCC\nCategory\ncode\nIPCC Category\nGHG\n2016\nEmissions\nCO2eq (Gg)\n2016\nEmissions\nLevel from\nthe Given\nCategory\nCumulative Total\n% of Column F\n1.A.3.b\nRoad Transportation\nCO2\n8566.56\n0.26\n26.4%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nGaseous Fuels\nCO2\n6495.61\n0.20\n46.3%\n4.A\nSolid Waste Disposal\nCH4\n3559.01\n0.11\n57.3%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nLiquid Fuels\nCO2\n2460.51\n0.08\n64.9%\n1.A.4\nOther Sectors - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2365.46\n0.07\n72.1%\n2.A.1\nCement production\nCO2\n1751.43\n0.05\n77.5%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n1669.84\n0.05\n82.7%\n3.B.1.a\nForest land Remaining\nForest land\nCO2\n-922.77\n0.03\n85.5%\n2.F.1\nRefrigeration and Air\nConditioning\nHFCs,\nPFCs\n762.23\n0.02\n87.9%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Solid\nFuels\nCO2\n737.23\n0.02\n90.1%\n1.A.5\nNon-Specified - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n680.06\n0.02\n92.2%\n3.A.1\nEnteric Fermentation\nCH4\n574.08\n0.02\n94.0%\n3.C.4\nDirect N2O Emissions\nfrom managed soils\nN2O\n510.55\n0.02\n95.6%\n2.10 Uncertainty Analysis\nThe uncertainty analysis is one of the main activities\nof the inventory process. Uncertainty information\nis intended to help prioritize efforts to improve the\naccuracy of inventories and guide decisions on the\nmethodological choice.\nThe analysis was carried out based on IPCC 2006\nGuidelines and Software. “Approach 1: Propagation\nof Error” was used. Approach 1 is based upon error\npropagation and is used to estimate uncertainty in\nindividual categories in the inventory as a whole,\nand in trends between 2016 and the base year\n2010. The uncertainty analysis was based on\nTier 1 approach and covers all source-categories\nand all direct greenhouse gases. The uncertainty\nestimation for the activity data and emission factors\nwas based on typical values of the IPCC.\nThe results indicate that net emissions in 2016\nwere 26,794.86 Gg of CO2eq with an uncertainty\nof ±5%, which corresponds to a 95% probability\n\n59\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nrange of 27,598.71 to 25,991.01 Gg of CO2eq. Based\nupon the total base year of 2010 and year 2016\ninventories, the average trend is a 34% increase\nin emissions from 2010 to 2016. The uncertainty\nin the trend is ±4% (percentage points), which\ncorresponds to a 95% probability range for the\ntrend with respect to base year emissions.\n2.11 GHG Inventory Quality Control/Quality\nAssurance and Review\nJordan acknowledges the need for having a manual\nfor national QC/QA procedures for GHG inventory\nestimation. This has been listed in Jordan’s future\nimprovement plans (section 2.12). Also, during the\npreparation of the GHG Inventories, the inventory\nteam and the BUR project management team\ncarried out the following tasks:\n Overall assessment technical reviews, and\naccuracy checks performed by the compilers\nto ensure consistency, accuracy, completeness\nand avoid double counting,\n Checking the accuracy of data input from the\noriginal references and confirm that correct\nreferences were used as well as ensuring that\nno transcription errors exist,\n Checking that parameter and emission units\nare correctly recorded and that appropriate\nconversion factors are used and checking as\nwell for consistency if more than one expert\nused same conversions and factor among\nvarious subsectors,\n Checking that the movement of inventory data\namong processing steps is correct,\n Checking that there is detailed internal\ndocumentation to support the estimates and\nenable full reconstruction of the estimate,\n Checking that inventory data are archived and\nstored to facilitate detailed review,\nIn terms of quality assurance the national GHG\ninventory chapter was subjected to an international\nreview which was coordinated by the UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Program (GSP) and was conducted\nfrom 7 to 13 October 2020 by Dr. Carlos López,\nconsultant in national GHG emissions inventories.\nThe review examined mainly the adherence of the\ninventory chapter to the requirements indicated in\nthe UNFCCC Decision 17/CP.8 Annex, the UNFCCC\nDecision 2/CP.17 Annex III, and to the advice of\nthe IPCC Guidelines and Guidance. The outcomes\nof the review resulted in several direct actions\nto improve the chapter and an inventory future\nimprovement plan (IIP); described in details in the\nfollowing section.\n2.12 Future Improvement Plan\nSeveral actions were identified by the GSP\nreviewer. The improvements are listed below\nand are rated according to urgency as; immediate,\nshort term and long term actions:\n\tThe activity data used in the estimate, especially\nin the subcategories identified as key or\nsignificant , should be improved as much as\npossible, in order to use tier 2. Also, actions to\nimprove data, methods, EF and other estimation\nparameters (OEP) should be prioritized in\nkey categories to use tier 2 (especially in the\nsubcategory 2F1a, 4A Solid Waste Disposal,\n3A1c Sheep and 3B Land). (short term and\nlong term),\n\tThe documentation boxes and worksheet\nremarks included within the software should\nbe added. (short term),\n\tThe completeness of the inventory should be\nimproved by: (short term to long term),\n- Improving the estimation and reporting of\nprecursor gas emissions in future inventory\nsubmissions (activity data and EF are mostly\navailable),\n- Incorporating among the precursor gases,\nthe estimation of NH3 emissions. This would\nmake it possible to calculate in category 5A\nthe indirect N2O Emissions derived from the\natmospheric deposition of Nitrogen from non\nagriculture sources,\n- The precursor gas emissions of these\nsubcategories from the second order\nsubcategories 1.A.3.a.i - International aviation\n\n60\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nand 1.A.3.d.i - International water-borne\nnavigation (international bunkers) should\nbe estimated and should be reported; using\nthe notation key NE (not-estimated) in the\nreporting tables, as necessary,\n The key analysis -trend assessment should be\nused after improving issues related to the time\nseries of the inventory. Also, qualitative criteria\nshould be applied to the categories located\nat the threshold of 95-97% of cumulative\nemissions. (short term),\n Prepare a QA/QC and verification plan and\nmanual for the coming inventory (short term).\nReferences\n\t2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and its 2019 Refinement.\n\tAmman Chamber of Industry Website, http://www.aci.org.jo, accessed December, 2019.\n\tArab Fertilizers and Chemical Industries (Kemapco).\n\tAmman Chamber of Industry Website, http://www.aci.org.jo, accessed December 2016.\n\tAmount and Characterization of Dairy Cattle Manure and Poultry Litter in Jordan, AECOM, August\n2014.\n\tCentral Bank of Jordan – Statistical Database, http://statisticaldb.cbj.gov.jo/index, accessed December\n2019.\n\tCustoms Department, letter No. 18/14/131 dated 8/1/2020\n\tDepartment of Statistics website: www.web.dos.gov.jo accessed May 2020\n\tDepartment of statistics, Jordan’s country analysis; environmental indicators, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2010,\n2012, and 2016.\n\tEnergy and Minerals Regulatory Commission (EMRC).\n\tEEA, 2019.

Name and description of the mitigation\naction, including information on the nature\nof the action, coverage (i.e. sectors and gases),\nquantitative goals and progress indicators;\nb.\nInformation on methodologies and\nassumptions;\nc. Objectives of the action and steps taken or\nenvisaged to achieve that action;\nd.\nInformation\non\nthe\nprogress\nof\nimplementation of the mitigation actions\nand the underlying steps taken or envisaged,\nand the results achieved, such as estimated\noutcomes (metrics depending on type of\naction) and estimated emission reductions,\nto the extent possible;\ne. Information on international market\nmechanisms.\n\tParties should provide information on the\ndescription\nof\ndomestic\nmeasurement,\nreporting and verification arrangements.\n(Detailed in chapter4 of this report).\nBased on the above requirements, this chapter has\nbeen prepared to update the baseline scenario\nand the FBUR mitigation measures as briefly\ndescribed in the following paragraphs.\n\tUpdate of the baseline scenario: A baseline\nscenario reflects a future in which there are\nno policies or programs designed to encourage\nor require actions that reduce GHG emissions\nor enhance carbon sinks.\n The FBUR baseline scenario was updated\nfor all economic sectors of energy, industry,\nagriculture and forestry in addition to the\nwaste sector, based on the strategies, policies\nand plans prevailing in the Jordanian context\nduring the time of preparation of this SBUR\n(2020). This requires a projection of the current\nlevels to future levels of each type of activity.\nThe newly released strategies, policies, action\nplans and committed projects were reviewed\nand summarized. In addition, all projects and\nactions that were part of FBUR baseline scenario\nwere reviewed to update their status. Based on\nthis review, the most probable future trends in\nactivities that will impact and shape the GHG\nemissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n-\nThe new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n-\nThe\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August\n2020,\n-\nThe\nnew\nsolid\nwaste\nmanagement\nframework law issued in March 2020 and\nentered in force in September 2020,\n-\nNational Renaissance Plan (2019-2020),\nissued in 2018,\n-\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n- The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in 2016,\n Update of FBUR mitigation measures: All\nFBUR mitigation projects were reviewed and\nassessed to identify all those still valid. The\nvalid projects were updated, after adjustments\nwere made in their expected implementation\ntimeline. The emission reduction and the unit\ncost of emission reduction for each mitigation\nproject have been recalculated taking into\nconsideration several factors such as the\n\n65\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nimprovement in technologies and changes\nin prices. Net present value was used in the\nfinancial calculations, by converting all present\nand future revenues and costs over the project’s\nlifetime to a base of today’s cost. The same\napproach was followed in calculating the CO2eq\nemissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nmitigation projects. A discount rate of 8% was\nused for both the cost and emission reduction\ncalculations. Also, the discounted unit cost of\nreduced emission reduction was calculated as\nthe quotient of the discounted cost in JD to\nthe discounted emission in tonnes CO2. The\nupdated FBUR mitigation projects include\n23 GHG mitigation measures in the sectors\nand subsectors of primary energy, renewable\nenergy, energy efficiency, industries, domestic\nsolid waste and wastewater, and agriculture\nand forestry.\n3.2 Baseline Scenario for the Different Sectors\n3.2.1 Baseline scenario for the energy sector\nA. The Current Status of the Infrastructure\nEnergy Projects Listed in the FBUR\nA.1 The delayed energy infrastructure projects\nExpansion of Jordan Oil Refinery Project\nA decision was made to implement an expansion\nto Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC),\nin order to improve the specifications of the\npetroleum products and to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products. Having\nan environmental management system is a\nrequirement from the IFC to grant the JPRC\nloan for expansion. Early 2020, the Refinery\nCompany published a call for services, specifically\nto undertake the planning of an environmental\nmanagement system, that includes environmental\nimpact assessment, environmental audit, health\nand safety and risk assessment. Due to COVID-19,\nthe implementation of this assessment was\ndelayed and accordingly the expansion has been\ndelayed. The expected date of completion for the\nproject is now 2025, instead of 2022.\nConstruction of the Iraqi Crude Oil Pipeline\nDue to the political situation in the region a delay\noccurred in the construction of the Iraqi crude oil\npipeline, which was supposed to transport Iraqi\ncrude oil across Jordanian territory to the export\nterminal in Aqaba with a capacity of 1 million\nbarrels/day, in addition to a branch to supply\nJordan Oil Refinery with 150 thousand barrels/\nday. The date of completion for the construction\nand operation of the pipeline is expected to be\n2027 instead of 2022.\nOil shale surface retorting projects\nAll the companies working in surface retorting\nof oil shale are still unable to fulfill the agreed\nobligations in their production schedules, due to\nchanges in economic feasibility. All the oil shale\ncompanies have been asked to postpone their\nproject development period some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed.\nNuclear Power Plant of 1,000 MW\nIn February 2019, the Ministerial Council took a\ndecision to cancel the construction of the nuclear\npower plant with a proposed capacity of 1,000\nMW, which was planned to be operational and\ncontributing to the electricity system in 2023.\nThis is due to the over committed electricity\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW. The council\ndecided to consider the introduction of smaller\nreactors instead.\nThe third round of the renewable energy projects\nThe decision was taken in the Ministry of Energy\nand Mineral Resources to delay the third round of\nthe renewable energy projects which consists of\nfour 50 MW solar and two 50 MW wind projects\ndue to the decrease in the growth rate of electricity\ndemand, which was 0-1.5% during the period\n2017-2019, and due to the over-committed\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW.\n\n66\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nA.2 The completed infrastructure projects\nMany infrastructure projects, policies, laws and\nbylaws have witnessed successful implementation\nas follows.\nCrude oil and oil products storage\nAll of the strategic projects to increase the storage\ncapacities of crude oil and oil products were\ncompleted on EPC basis and put in operation as\nplanned at the end of 2017, these projects are\nlisted below:\n-\nConstruction of 100 thousand tonnes\nstorage capacity for crude oil in Aqaba,\n-\nConstruction of strategic storage capacities\nfor light oil products with a capacity of\n250-300 thousand tonnes, and 8 thousand\ntonnes for LPG in Almadonah area, in central\nJordan,\n-\nEstablishment of the Oil Logistics Company\nin 2017 to secure the strategic storage\ncapacity of oil and oil products needed for\nthe country.\nElectricity generation and transmission projects\n\nThe new Zarqa Power Plant Project was\ncompleted, with a capacity of 485 MW, at\nthe site of the previous Hussein Power Plant.\nThe plant owned by ACWA Power Company,\noperates mainly on natural gas as primary\nfuel and diesel as secondary fuel. The project\nwas successfully completed and put into\noperation in the year 2019.\n\nThe first electric power plant using coke and\ncoal was completed in Al Karak governorate\nof Jordan, with a generation capacity of 30\nMW. The plant is equipped with the latest\nequipment and technologies in addition\nto the adherence to the internationally\nrecognized environmental standards. The\nplant was put into operation in 2018.\n\nIn mid-2019, the Green Corridor Project\nwas completed and put into operation. The\nproject’s aim is to transmit between 800-1,000\nMW of electricity from renewable energy\nsources, from the south to the load centres\nin other regions in Jordan. This project will\naccommodate electrical power generated\nfrom new renewable energy sources.\nNatural gas projects\nThe construction of the natural gas pipeline in\nthe north of Jordan, designed to import natural\ngas from Nobel Energy Company was completed\nin 2020. The pipeline was constructed according\nto the agreement signed between the National\nPower Company (NEPCO) and Nobel Energy in\n2018.\nRenewable energy projects\nA remarkable achievement in the completion\nof renewable energy projects for electricity\ngeneration has been achieved. All the renewable\nenergy projects listed and considered in the\nbaseline scenario in the FBUR and planned to be\nexecuted by the end of 2019, were completed in\ndue time, as planned.\nBy the end of 2019, 850 MW of solar and 375 MW\nof wind projects were connected to the grid,\nincluding 150 MW net metering projects and\n130 MW wheeling projects.

The Energy Baseline Scenario in the SBUR for\nthe Period 2016-2066\nIn order to build the energy demand and supply\nbaseline scenario in the SBUR, several matters\nand issues which will affect and drive the energy\nscenario will be considered. The most important\nof these are as follows.\nB.1 The over commitment of electricity generation\ncapacity in the country\nThe generation capacity of thermal power plants as\nof the end of September 2019 reached (4,257 MW)\nand while the generation capacity of renewable\nenergy projects (solar and wind) reached (1,130\nMW). Comparatively the maximum peak load for\nthe first half of 2019 was around 3,000 MW.\nThis volume of available generating capacity is\nlarge compared to the maximum peak load and\neven, considering the capacity of conventional\ngeneration stations only, exceeds it by 30%.\n This is in contrast to the internationally recognized\npractices in this industry, which has limits of 10%\n-15%, especially in electrical systems that are\nconnected to electric networks similar to the\nJordanian network. This causes significant costs for\nthe electrical system, since there is a commitment\nto pay for the cost of capacity for the power stations,\n\n69\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\neven if their operation is suspended, according to\nthe Energy Purchase Agreement, which is based on\nthe principle of take or pay. Continuous operation\nof the power stations is not needed as a result of\nthe decline in growth rates in electricity demand\ndue to many reasons, among these:\n\nA high growth rate for the peak load of 6.2%\nannually was adopted in the electrical system\nexpansion planning. However, the actual\ngrowth rate during the three years of (20172019) ranged between (0% - 2%). This was\na result of consumers’ tendency to increase\nthe use of energy-saving technologies, and\nto expand dependence on self-generation\nthrough small and large renewable energy\nprojects, and\n\nEconomic growth decline as a result of\npolitical conditions in the region.\nB.2 The new National Energy Strategy for the\nperiod 2020-2030\nThe Ministry of Energy issued a new energy\nstrategy for the period 2020-2030 and it was\napproved by the Ministerial Council in March 2020\ntogether with a framework implementation plan.\nThe new energy strategy re- estimated the annual\ngrowth rate of the primary energy demand for\nthe period 2020-2030 to be 0.9%, and the annual\ngrowth rate of the electricity demand for the same\nperiod to be 1.1% compared to 2.4% and 4.1% for\nprimary energy demand and electricity demand\nrespectively considered in the previous energy\nstrategy (2015-2025). Table (3.3) illustrate the\ncomparison of the electricity demand in GWh\nbetween the two strategies.\nTable 3.3: Comparison of electricity demand (GWh) within the two energy strategies\nYears\n2020\n2023\n2025\n2030\nEnergy Strategy 2020-2030\n17,672\n17,950\n18,686\n19,701\nEnergy Strategy 2015-2025\n23,150\n26,470\n28,900\n34,990\nThe new strategy aims to achieve energy security\nfor the country and to increase the contribution of\nthe local resources in the energy mix. It also aims\nto decrease the heavy burden of the energy cost\non the national economy and to study the impacts\nof renewable energy projects on the electricity\ngeneration system.\nConsidering the above mentioned issues and facts,\nand according to the previous energy strategy\n2015-2025 and the new energy strategy 2020-2030\nwith their components and the implementation\nplans; the most probable baseline scenario in the\nenergy sector will be based on the adopted goals,\npolicies, and laws, and the planned and committed\nprojects within the energy strategies.\nPolicies, projects and activities considered in the\nbaseline scenario up to 2030 and beyond to 2066\nThe most reliable policies, projects and activities\nconsidered in the baseline scenario up to 2030 and\nbeyond to the year 2066 are summarized in the\nfollowing sections.\nThe Field of Oil and Oil Products\nThe main policy: Securing the needs of the\nKingdom’s crude oil and oil products. Securing the\nKingdom’s oil products needs will be achieved by\nthe following:\n\nJordan Petroleum Refinery will continue to\nproduce 14 thousand tonnes per day (100\nthousand barrels) to meet 60% of the need\nof the domestic market for oil products,\naccording to 2015 statistics. The remainder\nof the needs of the domestic market for oil\nproducts will be imported. This arrangement\nis proposed to last up to 2040.\n\nImplement the expansion of the Jordan\nPetroleum Refinery in order to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products and\nimprove the specifications of petroleum\nproducts. The expansion is planned to be\ncompleted by 2026.\n\n70\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nContinue to meet Jordan’s needs for crude\noil by importing oil from Saudi Arabia by sea,\nthen transporting it in oil tankers to the oil\nrefinery in the centre area of the kingdom.\nThis is planned to continue up to 2027.\n\nConstruction of the Iraqi crude oil pipeline\nto export Iraqi crude oil across Jordanian\nterritory to the export terminal in Aqaba\nwith a capacity of 1 million barrels/day in\naddition to a branch to supply Jordan Oil\nRefinery with 150 thousand barrels/day. The\npipeline is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nThe continuation of the policy of liberalization\nof prices of petroleum products, and pricing\noil products on a monthly basis in accordance\nwith international oil prices. The pricing\npolicy is the most successful mechanism\nand technique to improve the efficiency of\nconsumption.\nThe Field of Natural Gas\nThe main policy: diversifying the natural gas\nresources.\nAfter the completion and construction of LNG\nterminal in Aqaba which went into commercial\noperation in September 2015, Jordan has the\nability to meet all the country’s needs for natural\ngas for electricity generation and for the industrial\nsector.\nCurrently, Jordan imports natural gas by three\nroutes: via the LNG terminal in Aqaba which\nwent into commercial operation in September\n2015, via the Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt and\nvia pipeline from the Noble Energy Company on\na take or pay basis.\nIn 2019, 86% of the electricity generation of the\nKingdom was based on natural gas imported via\nthe LNG terminal and Egyptian natural gas.\nThe natural gas needed for electricity generation\nduring the period 2016-2022 was estimated to\nbe 350-420 Million Metric Cubic Feet per Day\n(MMcfd). However in the period 2023-2025, the\nquantity will be decreased to 250-350 MMcfd, due\nto the operation of the oil shale power plants.\nThe demand of the industrial sector for natural\ngas is estimated to be 150 MMcfd in the same\nperiod of 2023-2025.\nIn addition, the National Petroleum Company\n(NPC) plans to develop the Risha gas field, in\nJordan, to increase natural gas production\nfrom the site, to 50 MMcfd as a 1st stage. NPC\nhas announced the Risha field as an investment\nopportunity, and is aiming to attract a strategic\npartner for this project.\nIn regard to utilizing waste to generate electricity,\nthe following two projects will be considered:\n- A power plant will be built, which will operate\non direct burning of solid waste, with a\ncapacity of (50 MW) in the Central Area of\nthe Kingdom.\n- A bio–gas power plant will be built, with a\ncapacity of (25 MW), in Ghabawi area, East of\nAmman, , to be operational, in 2022.\nThe Field of Renewable Energy\nThe main policy: utilizing the renewable energy\nresources to generate electricity.\nIn light of the large progress in utilizing the\nrenewable energy resources to generate electricity,\nthe total capacity of the constructed, under\nconstruction and committed projects during the\nperiod 2020-2023 will reach 2400 MW as illustrated\nearlier. Considering the NEPCO situation, the total\nnew capacity of wind and solar energy to be added\nto the system during the period 2024-2030 will be\n600 MW of which 400 MW will be wheeling and\nnet metering systems.\nThe Field of Oil Shale\nThe main policy: utilizing the oil shale resources\nto generate electricity and produce oil.\n\n71\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n Oil shale projects for electricity generation\nDue to the over-committed generating capacity\nin terms of MW, the second direct burning of oil\nshale project for electricity generation will be\nconsidered in the year 2028.\n Oil shale projects for extraction of oil shale\nAll oil shale companies were asked to postpone\nthe development period, and some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed their businesses. Oil shale\ncompanies that asked for development period\nextension were Jordan Oil Shale Company (JOSCO)\nwhich was intending to produce 20,000 barrels of\noil shale in 2025, Jordan Oil Shale Energy Company\n(JOSE) intending to produce 20,000 barrels/day\nin 2025, Karak International Oil Company (KIO)\nintending to produce 25,000 barrels/day in 2024,\nand Saudi Arabian Corp for Oil Shale (SACOS)\nintending to produce 20,000 barrels/day in 2025.\nThe Field of Nuclear Energy\nConsidering the over committed generating\ncapacity in terms of MW, in the national electric\nsystem, introducing nuclear energy as an\nalternative for electricity generation will be\nconsidered after the year 2030. The Atomic Energy\nCommission is conducting a study to find the best\ntechnology to construct small nuclear reactors in\nseveral locations in Jordan territory, from two to\nsix units with a capacity of 110 MW for each unit.\n3.2.2 Baseline scenario for the transport sector\nA. Sector Policies and Strategies\nA.1 Strategies, policies and plans at the national\nlevel\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No. 89, 2003. Jordan’s Long Term\nNational Transport Strategy and Action Plan set\nout the sector policies and strategies. Key policies\ninclude:\n\nImplementing a multi modal approach to\ninclude rail, with good interconnections\nbetween modes, networks and transport\nservices.\n\nProtecting the environment, by increasing\nthe modal share of low-carbon transport\nmodes, and improving energy efficiency by\npromoting innovative technologies.\n\nProviding a greater degree of accessibility,\nparticularly where current provision of public\ntransport services are poor or inadequate.\nBased on these main policies a number of strategies\nwere developed to achieve the goals set out for\nthe sector. These strategies were adapted to form\nfive alternative scenarios. These were prioritized by\nincorporating Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) results\ninto a Multi-Criteria Analysis framework, which\nconsidered impacts of the scenarios over the six\ncriteria: regional, technical, social, policy, economic\nand financial and environmental.\nThe chosen scenario was the scenario termed\nthe “Environmental Option”. This scenario was\nbuilt (within the strategy) selecting measures\naimed at reducing the impacts of the transport\nsector on the environment (i.e. emissions, effects\nof climate change, noise and land use). In the\n‘Environmental’ Scenario public transport was\ngiven a high priority, with strategies aimed\nat shifting modal shares from private to mass\ntransit. These included improvement of networks,\nincluding the implementation of the Hejaz railway\nalong its entire route from Aqaba to the Syrian\nborder and also setting minimum safety and\nquality standards for public transport vehicles.\nConcerning the road sector, the included strategies\nplaced higher importance on maintenance and\nsafety-enhancing measures for the existing\nnetwork, rather than extensive road-building.\nFurther strategies concerned minimum safety\nand emissions standards for freight vehicles.\nNational Climate Change Policy\nOne of the key national policies that tackled the\nTransport sector was the National Climate Change\nPolicy for Jordan 2013-2020. For the transport\nsector, the policy identified the following strategic\nclimate change objectives:\n\n72\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nTo integrate climate change mitigation\nobjectives and the impact of GHG emissions\ninto transport policies, strategies and action\nplans,\n\nTo promote use of energy efficient, low carbon\ntechnologies, and increase understanding of\ntheir mitigation impact,\n\nTo promote low carbon energy efficient\nmodes of transport.\nThe report also recommended measures to\nachieve the afore-mentioned objectives:\n\nDeveloping\nand\nstrengthening\nlocal\ncapacities in assessment of different transport\nmodes and their mitigation effect,\n\nImproving data collection related to activity\ndata, emissions and emissions factors,\n\nDeveloping Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs).\nIntended Nationally Determined Contributions\n(INDCs)\nIn 2016, Jordan submitted its INDCs to the\nUNFCCC  with the objective of reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. This INDCs Action\nPlan was formally approved by Jordan in August\n2019. The INDCs include mitigation projects for\nthe transport sector including: implementing\na railway system, implementing the bus rapid\ntransit (BRT) nationally, provision of electric car\ncharging stations powered by renewable energy\nand ensuring the inclusion of energy efficiency\nconsiderations in purchase of vehicles. The aim of\nthese projects is to increase the total number of\ncommuters using public transport and reduce total\nvehicle kilometers travelled, fuel consumption,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants\n(More details can be found in Appendix B)\nHighway Master Plan\nThe Ministry of Public Works and Housing\n(MoPWH) carried out its Highway Master Plan\nStudy in 2011. This study provided a timephased road sector development plan up\nto 2030, recommending roads and bridges\nin need of recovery maintenance, including\nimplementation of identified safety measures,\nthe major task identified was the rehabilitation\nof the Desert Highway. Several highways were\nalso recommended for road widening to ease\ncongestion. The study suggested that the\nnetwork was sufficient, but recommended the\nimplementation of a ring road for Amman.\nA.2 Strategies, policies and plans at the subnational level (within GAM)\nAs for Amman city, GAM’s planning document is\nthe 2010 Transport Mobility Master Plan (TMMP),\nwhich has been designed to guide development\nof the transport system within GAM up to 2025.\nThe transport policies developed by GAM in the\nTMMP were based on providing a public Transport\n(PT) system which is accessible and affordable to\nall and encouraging a variety of mobility options\nwhile promoting public transport and walking.\nGAM strategies were developed related to public\ntransport, road safety, pedestrian environment,\nparking, freight, intelligent transport systems (ITS),\ndemand management and the road network.\nStrategies were also developed for the Downtown\nof Amman.\nIn the TMMP twelve scenarios were developed.\nThese scenarios were basically based on the level\nof public transport to be provided (regular bus,\nBRT, light rail) combined with a range of demand\nmanagement measures (soft, medium and\nhard). For GAM the preferred scenario included\nsubstantial investment in high quality public\ntransport services, i.e. bus rapid transit (BRT)\nand light rail, but combined with soft demand\nmanagement.\nTransport and mobility projects have also\nbeen developed within Amman in documents\nseeking to encourage the city’s development in a\nsustainable and environmentally friendly manner.\nThese include:\n\n73\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAmman Resilience Strategy\nThis was developed with the guidance of the\nRockefeller Institute’s 100 resilient cities. As well\nas projects for an integrated mobility plan, BRT\nand metro. The report developed the following\nprojects:\n\nDevelop an urban mobility observatory,\nto enable a data-driven decision-making\napproach,\n\nDevelop, review and update Amman’s street\nmanual to provide guidance to city planners\nto design safe, high standard streets that\nprovide universal and inclusive accessibility\nand promote a walkable environment,\n\nCreate a walking map to show routes between\nneighborhoods,\n\nExplore tactical urbanism opportunities\ni.e. creating opportunities for youth to\nparticipate in the redesign of spaces and\ntemporarily reclaim spaces designated to\ncars,\n\nOrganize a design competition for the area\naround Amman’s Hejaz Railway, to increase\naccess to green spaces in the city.\nAmman Climate Plan, a Vision for 2050\nThis vision document, which was developed\nwith the assistance of the World Bank, sets out a\nseries of projects for transport and mobility. These\ninclude expansion of several of GAM’s projects\nincluding more lanes of BRT, purchasing more\nelectric vehicles to replace vehicles owned by\nGAM and taxis and providing buses with improved\nfuel specifications. In addition, they recommend\nenhancing the efficiency of the city bus network,\nto be addressed as part of the Feeder project.\nAdditionally, the plan recommends the following\nprojects, many of which could be achieved in the\nshort term:\n\nImplementation of a public transportation\nawareness plan to change perceptions and\nbehavior,\n\nCoordination of transit-oriented planning\nwith the planning and transportation\ndepartments,\n\nInstallation of electric vehicle charging\nstations around the city,\n\nImplementation of benefits for zero/low\nemission vehicles, including fast lanes,\nparking discounts, and reduced fees,\n\nInstalling bike paths and other bike safety\nmeasures.\nThe vision document also recommends the\nimprovement of walkability through:\n\nInstallation of new sidewalks,\n\nMaintenance and improvement of existing\nsidewalks,\n\nIncreased green space and tree cover,\n\nIntroduction of pedestrian safety measures.\nGreen City Action Plan\nThis project was launched in 2017 between EBRD\nand GAM to promote sector reforms and develop\npriority projects to modernise infrastructure and\nmunicipal services in Amman.\nThe report is still under development, but it will\nrecommend projects based on the strategic\nobjectives of:\n\nIncreasing the modal share of public\ntransportation,\n\nDeveloping a public realm strategy that\nsupports\npedestrian\ntravel,\n\nIncorporating smart systems in transport\nplanning.\nB. Key Committed Projects\nAmman Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Amman\nZarqa BRT: In these projects, which are currently\nunder construction, buses will be operated in their\nown dedicated lanes. The two systems will be\noperated as one integrated system and will form\nan important backbone for transport in the area.\n\n74\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nThe Amman BRT project will be supported by a\nstudy, to be implemented by GAM, concerning\npublic transport in the area of the Amman BRT.\nThe aim of this study is to advise how to rearrange\nand supplement current public transport services\nin order to support and make ‘best use’ of the\nBRT, by providing ‘feeder’ services to provide\naccess from neighborhoods to BRT stations.\nPotential benefits of these combined projects\nare to improve the image of public transport and\nencourage a mode shift from private vehicles to\nBRT and public transport in general. This mode\nshift from private vehicles to public transport, is\nexpected to produce a reduction in congestion,\nfuel use and emissions of greenhouse gases and\nother pollutants.\n The fuel type of the buses to be purchased is\nstill under consideration. The minimum standard,\nwould be diesel Euro V or Euro VI, but electric\nbuses are still under consideration.\nThe reorganization of the current public transport\nsystem for Amman based on the Feeder Study is\nexpected to lead to a greater number of services\nbeing operated by new BRT buses. This would\nlead to a decrease in emissions, however is not\npossible to estimate the emissions savings until\nreorganization of public transport networks has\nbeen agreed.\nProposed Update of TMMP: A comprehensive\nlist of proposed projects is laid out in the TMMP\nto support the strategies identified by GAM for\ntransport in the city. However, it is considered\nthat the next step for GAM should be to carry\nout an update of the TMMP, since the previous\nstudy is now 10 years old and there have been\nconsiderable changes in the city, in particular a\nlarge growth in population. This would enable the\npolicies and strategies to be set out for mobility in\nGAM for the next 15 years, with the aim of guiding\nAmman city into development while considering\nenergy efficiency and sustainability. One of the\nexpected outcomes of the project is a roadmap\nfor future growth in mobility in GAM with clear\npriorities given to proposed projects.\nThe Data Warehouse Project: this project is\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, with the\npurpose of collecting, storing, processing and\ndistribution of data concerning the transport\nsector. This should motivate the use of data by\ndecision makers at all levels. Potential benefits\ninclude the use of trends analysis to make\nestimates for the future and use of previous\nexperience in future planning.\nPublic Transport Restructuring Project for\nGovernorates: Projects are planned to restructure\nthe urban public transport systems of Irbid, Zarqa\nand Madaba with the aim of developing reliable\npublic transport systems and improving the level\nof services for citizens. Potential benefits are to\npromote a mode shift to public transport trips,\nfrom private vehicle trips, with a subsequent\nreduction in congestion, fuel use and emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants.\nIntelligent Transport Systems Project (ITS): The\naim of this project is to develop and operate ITS\nto monitor and control public transport services,\nand to provide an integrated electronic payment\nsystem. This has been implemented in GAM as\na pilot project with the new buses for Amman\nVision introduced in 2019. Potential benefit is\nin adding convenience for passengers, helping\nto promote mode shift from private vehicles to\npublic transport.\nAmman, Salt and Irbid Ring Roads: Salt and\nIrbid ring roads are currently under construction.\nAmman ring road, Phase 1, also known as Amman\nDevelopment Corridor is already completed.\nFeasibility and Environmental Studies, as well as\ndetailed designs have been carried out for the\nremaining sections. Potential benefits of these\nprojects are to relieving traffic congestion in the\ncities, particularly from truck traffic and improve\naccess to areas on the outskirts of the city.\n\n75\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAirport Projects: Air travel connections to\nJordan are vital to Jordan’s economic growth.\nProjects have been proposed to accommodate\nin future increasing passenger numbers,\nthrough expansion at Amman Civil Airport and\nKing Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nImplementation of a further airport has also been\nsuggested. Potential benefits of these projects are\npredominantly economic, but are also important\nfor accessibility.\nProjects concerning freight: In order to\nevaluate the GHG mitigation effect of freight\nprojects, concerning use of different modes\nof transportation, emissions factors from the\ndifferent modes published by Department of the\nEnvironment, Fisheries & Rural Affairs (Defra), UK\nhave been compared. The lowest emissions from\nfreight transport are for cargo ship, followed by\nfreight rail services, and therefore these would\nbe the best options for freight to and within the\ncountry. Transporting freight by air, either within\nthe country or into the country has the largest\nemissions factors, and therefore road freight is\nto be preferred to air freight.\nASEZA Rail Freight Project: Feasibility and\ntechnical studies are being undertaken for the\ndevelopment of a railway connecting a planned\nland port at Ma’an with port facilities around\nAqaba. Potential benefits are to encourage mode\nshift for freight between Aqaba and Ma’an from\nroad to rail, leading to a reduction in congestion,\nand emissions of greenhouse gases and other\npollutants.\nMoT National Railway Project: The aim is to\nestablish a freight railway network. The railway\nbetween Aqaba and Ma’an forms the first part\nof this plan. The remainder of the project is still\nin need of funding. Potential benefits are to\nencourage mode shift for freight around the\ncountry and to/from neighboring countries from\ntrucks to railway with an expected reduction in\ncongestion and emissions from greenhouse gases\nand other pollutants.\nC. Future Trends in Transport Sector\nIn the short term (around 5 years) there are\nmany projects being implemented, which will\nhave a large effect on transport in Jordan. The\nBRT network for Amman and between Zarqa and\nAmman should be operational in 2021, with a\nmodern comfortable bus fleet. The reorganization\nand restructuring of public transport services in\nAmman, Zarqa, Irbid and Madaba, should also\nhave been carried out, with implementation of ITS\ntechnology on all buses. Additionally, walkability\nin Amman is already being improved, with the\nrehabilitation of areas along the BRT lines currently\nunder construction by GAM.\nThese projects and improvements are expected\nto encourage a mode shift in trips from private\nvehicles to public transport as it is made more\nconvenient and comfortable. This is expected to\nlead to a reduction in congestion and a decrease\nin fuel use, with a corresponding drop in emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants. These\nprojects may additionally be copied by other\ngovernorates and within Amman, where there is\npotential for further lines of BRT and improvements\nin walking infrastructure. The data warehouse\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, would be\na source of data and information concerning all\ntransport projects, which could be made available\nto interested organisations.\nThe MoPWH is expected to have completed\nnecessary rehabilitation of the Desert Highway,\nand carried out widening and rehabilitation of\nroads, as identified in the 2011 Highways Master\nPlan. This would lead to improved journey times\nand reduced congestion, which would lead\nto more efficient operations for road freight\ntransport.\nGAM’s TMMP Update Project should have been\ncompleted\nproviding\nimportant\nguidance\nconcerning the priority for projects in the transport\nsector within the city.\nIt is expected to have more electric cars on the\nroads of Amman, purchased by GAM and by the\npublic, as they are shown to be efficient for city-\n\n76\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nuse and as fuel stations and destinations in the\ncity provide more charging stations.\nIn the medium term (around 10 years) larger\ninfrastructure projects committed by the\nGovernment of Jordan should have been\nimplemented. These are expected to include the\npipeline project between Jordan and Iraq and the\nrailway project between Aqaba and Ma’an. These\ntwo projects would remove a large number of\ntruck vehicle kms from the network, since trips\nby oil trucks to Zarqa from Amman and Iraq, and\ntrips by freight lorries between Amman and Aqaba\nare expected to be largely replaced by trips by\npipeline or rail.\nWork on Amman Civil Airport and King Hussein\nInternational Airport, are expected to have been\ncompleted, allowing greater passenger trips and\nboosting tourist numbers and economic growth\nin the country.\nRing roads around Amman, Salt and Irbid should\nhave been completed, improving accessibility for\nareas around these cities and reducing congestion\nin the city centres. Stronger legislation will have\nbeen possible for trucks to keep them out of the\nurban areas of these cities, now suitable alternative\nroutes have been provided, reducing congestion,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants.\nKey projects for the longer term include the\nNational Rail Network, which would connect with\nthe railway from Aqaba at Ma’an. This is expected\nto carry a large proportion of the freight across\nJordan, which would provide savings in terms of\nreducing Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) on the\nroad network, with a reduction in congestion, fuel\nuse, GHG emissions and other pollutants. Metro\nfor Amman could also have been implemented.\nAdditionally, it is expected to have projects for\nGAM, as prioritized through the TMMP Update\nproject. Potentially these could include a tram for\nDowntown Amman, and light rail from Amman\nto Queen Alia International Airport.\n3.2.3 Baseline scenario for the industrial\nprocess sector\nIndustry is a significant contributor to Jordan’s\nGDP, directly contributing about 24% to the\nnational Gross Domestic Product (GDP), during\n2017.\nIndustry in Jordan is divided into two main types;\nmanufacturing sector, including the production\nof cement, lime, fertilizers and chemicals, and the\nmining and quarrying sector, including quarrying\nof limestone.\nJordan’s industrial sector is increasingly affected by\nregional circumstances; exports to Iraq and Syria\ndecreased because of the increasing difficulties of\ntransportation and trade across the north-eastern\nand northern borders and the land routes to the\nMediterranean. Moreover, the industrial sector is\nfacing new challenges due to COVID-19 pandemic\nin 2020, i.e. Cement production has decreased due\nto Lockdown, and particularly periods of curfew\nthat have slowed down operations significantly.\nThe government has focused on developing\nthe industrial sector, through attracting foreign\ninvestment, privatization of public establishments\nand providing customs and tax exemptions\nfor investment projects within the different\nsectors, particularly the mining sector. However,\nGovernment policies should take into account the\nafore-mentioned industry circumstances.\nThere are laws and regulations that encourage\nand protect the capital investment such as Jordan\nInvestment Law No. 30 of 2014. However, current\nJordanian laws and regulations do not directly\ncontrol CO2 and other GHG emissions from\nindustrial processes. For example, the Jordanian\nlegally binding standards (JS 1189/2006)\nconcerning the quantity and quality of emissions\nfrom stationary sources such as the industrial\nprocesses has no specific threshold value for CO2\nand GHG emissions.\nThe following are the governmental policies,\nstrategies and plans relevant to the industrial\nsector:\n\n77\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe Ministry of Industry Trade and Supply\ndeveloped an industrial policy (2017 – 2021)\nto enhance the competitiveness of the\nindustrial sector, increase its contribution to\neconomic development, enable it to increase\nits exports to traditional and new markets,\nand increase the investment through an\neffective partnership with the private sector,\n\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021)\nincludes the establishment of a fund to\nsupport and finance industrial development\nin order to finance projects resulting from the\nindustrial policy, reduce the operational costs\non the industrial sector through motivating\nthe use of alternative energy sources,\nproviding technical and financial support\nto industrial companies, and developing\ninfrastructure and regulatory procedures for\nthe transport sector in all modes serving the\nindustrial activities,\n\nThe National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020)\nsingled out a major thrust for the state of\nproduction which includes a number of\nnational priorities and projects related to the\nindustry and commerce sectors and small\nand medium enterprises. These priorities and\nprojects aim to increase productivity, increase\ngrowth in Jordan’s economy and generate\ndecent job opportunities for Jordanians,\n\nBylaw No. 13/2020 includes a set of standards\nand criteria that must be achieved for the\nindustrial sector, including supporting the\ndevelopment of this sector, increasing its\ncompetitiveness in foreign markets and\nproviding job opportunities for Jordanians.\nListed below are the main plans/activities of\nthe government to improve the industrial\nperformance of Jordan:\n\nEnhance the competitiveness of the industrial\nsector and increase its export potential to\ntraditional and new markets,\n\nImproving the quality of local products and\nadapting them to international specifications.\n\nProviding job opportunities for all Jordanians,\nincluding female workers and people with\ndisabilities,\n\nIncrease confidence in the industrial sector\nand support the development of this sector\nto effectively contribute to economic\ndevelopment of the country,\n\nAllow the lease of treasury lands in the\ngovernorates for the purpose of establishing\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by the\ngovernorates citizens, according to specific\ncontrols and standards,\n\nReduce the operational costs of the\nindustrial sector through motivating the\nuse of alternative energy sources, providing\ntechnical and financial support to industrial\ncompanies, and developing infrastructure\nand regulatory procedures for the transport\nsector for all modes serving industrial\nactivities,\n\nImprove the investment environment, in\norder to attract foreign investments to all\nthe governorates,\n\nImprove the required infrastructure of\nservices needed for industrial activities,\n\nReduce the gap between the output of\neducation and vocational training and the\nneeds of the labor market and provide the\nnecessary support, in order to build the\ncapacities of workers in the industrial sector,\n\nEnhance the communication between\ntechnical research and development entities\nand industries in order to improve knowledge\nconcerning\nuse\nof\nnew\ntechniques/\ntechnologies,\n\nEnhance the adoption of Best Available\nTechnology (BAT) and Best Environmental\nPractices (BEP) in the industrial processes,\n\nImprove regulations and policies in order to\nencourage industrial investment,\n\nEnhance cooperation between the private\nand public sectors,\n\n78\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nEstablish a national strategy to improve the\nexport of local products to the international\nmarket,\n\nImprove the financial support mechanism\nto incentivise industrial investments,\n\nProvide technical support to the industries\nin order to comply with technical and\nenvironmental standards and enhance\ntheir participation in setting standards and\ndecision-making.\n3.2.4 Baseline scenario for the waste sector\nJordan is shifting towards more sustainable\nsolid waste management systems and trying to\nintroduce more innovative options to tackle the\nchallenge of solid waste management, especially\nwith the high pressure exerted on its system with\nthe flux of refugees as a result of the Syrian crisis\nin recent years. Efforts made by the Ministry of\nEnvironment resulted in the adoption of The Solid\nWaste Framework Law, which aims at producing\ngood governance in the waste sector. The Ministry\nof Local Administration also adopted the National\nStrategy in 2015, which diagnoses most of the\nproblems the waste management system suffers\nfrom. Some of the problems and weaknesses\nidentified by the strategy are: low operational\nefficiency of municipalities and Joint Services\nCouncils, lack of information, low sanitation level\nat landfills (except Ghabawi), low level of recycling,\nfew projects for waste to energy and composting\nactivities.\nThe new solid waste management framework\nlaw which came into force in September 2020\nwill organise the solid waste sector in Jordan for\nthe coming years and will provide the basis for\nbetter solid waste management.\nThe per capita solid waste generation rate is\ncurrently around 1kg/capita/day for urban areas\nin Jordan and is expected to continue increasing\nin the coming years with urbanization, reduction\nof family size and with increase in income. Waste\nin rural areas will mostly continue to increase but\nat a higher rate than in urban areas.\nFunds from international agencies contributed\nto upgrading the solid waste infrastructure. The\nupgrade in solid waste infrastructure such as\nintroduction of more solid waste transfer stations\nwill improve the system capacity and will also\nimprove the financial situation of municipalities\nespecially medium and large ones.\nAlso,\nsome\ndonors\nhave\nstarted\nwaste\nmanagement programs such as waste sorting\nfacilities and composting at some landfills and\nwithin refugees camps. The unstable recyclables\nmarket still hinders the sustainability of the waste\nreduction and recycling programs as they still do\nnot meet their monetary- economic feasibility.\nComposting will continue to be unfeasible unless\nit is adopted as governmental policy for waste\nreduction.\nPrivate Public Partnership (PPP) in solid waste\nactivities in Jordan is still weak and needs to be\nimproved even though there are some good\nexamples in Aqaba, Zarqa, and Petra. Awareness\nof public and vocational training of solid waste\nworkers still needs to be improved more with\nfocus on introducing key performance indicators\nfor waste collection systems and workers at\nmunicipality level. Improvements expected in\nsolid waste management will not be sustainable\nunless an information management system is\nadopted at all levels.\nThe economic success along with good\ngovernance in solid waste management are the\nmost important. It is also important to achieve\ndecoupling between GDP and waste generation\nwhich is not an easy task. Success in decoupling\nis ensured by effective awareness raising, waste\nreduction programs, waste recycling and reuse\nand application of resource efficiency and cleaner\nproduction principles in industry.\nClimate change is expected to impact both waste\ngeneration rate and waste decomposition rate.\nReduced cloud cover, as one of the climate change\nfeatures, adversely impacts the life of exposed\nmaterial resulting in more waste generation.\nIn general, the rate of population growth in Jordan\nhas been declining since the 1950’s except during\n\n79\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nexceptional circumstances, such as the Gulf War,\nwhere population increased by 10.3% and 6.72% in\n1990 and 1991 respectively. The strategy suggests\nthat the decrease in population growth rate will\ncontinue and may reach around 1.26 % in 2040.\nIn reality, the growth rate will not continue to\ndecrease, but would reach a fixed value of around\n2.1% as the growth rate of population is greatly\naffected by religious belief, social circumstances\nand economic situation. As such, the solid waste\nquantities generated will continue to increase, but\nwith a lower rate if only dependent on population\nincrease, and disregarding other factors. This is in\nline with the assumption of the national strategy\nthat assumes a 2.04% increase rate for urban areas\nand 1.02 % increase rate for rural areas. According\nto the strategy, by 2039 solid waste from urban\nareas will reach 1.64 and from rural areas 1.112\nkg/capita/day.\nHowever, in reality the waste generated per\ncapita is not expected to continue increasing\nand it should reach some stagnant point (noting\nthat Jordan is an upper middle income country\naccording to World Bank classification and is not\nexpected to become a high income country in\nthe foreseeable future).\nWaste composition is an important aspect for\nsuccessful environmental policies and good\nwaste management programs. Many solid waste\ncomposition studies have been performed\nin Jordan at different levels, most of them to\nanalyse waste received at landfills and others\nbased on samples at initial disposal points. It can\nbe concluded from all the studies that organic\nwaste seems to be the main component of the\nmunicipal solid waste, in addition to packaging\nwaste, which seems to be significant mostly in\nurban areas. Waste composition is not fixed and\ncould be changed based on different limiting\nfactors such as socioeconomic conditions,\nurbanization, etc. As Jordan accepts waves of\nrefugees from nearby countries, these incoming\npeople may have different social behaviors that\naffect waste composition at country level, but no\nspecific studies have been conducted to study\nthis impact. Also, unforeseen events affect waste\ncomposition, such as the current COVID 19 crisis\nwhich immediately resulted in an increase in\nplastic waste in the form of gloves and masks.\nBut this crisis may result in permanent changes in\nwaste composition such as increasing packaging\nwaste as a result of a change in social behavior,\nas people start ordering more online products.\nIn conclusion, waste quantities will continue to\nincrease with time in Jordan in the short and\nmedium term. To reach decoupling between\nwaste generation and economic growth, robust\npolicies need to be applied. Waste composition\nwill continue to change as the urbanization rate\nincreases, family size decreases, GDP increases and\nbased on other related factors.\n3.2.5 Baseline scenario for the AFOLU sector\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nis unique among all sectors, since its mitigation\npotential is based on both an enhancement of\nremovals of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as\nreduction of emissions through management\nof land and livestock. The AFOLU sector is\nresponsible for around a quarter of the annual\nGHG emissions resulting mainly from deforestation\nand agricultural emissions from livestock, soil\nand nutrient management. Opportunities for\nmitigation include both the supply-side and\ndemand side options as well as forests which are\nconsidered important carbon pools.\nPolicies governing practices in agriculture and\nin forest conservation and management need\nto account for both mitigation and adaptation.\nAnthropogenic\nland-use\nactivities\n(e.g.,\nmanagement of croplands, forests, grasslands,\nwetlands), and changes in land use/cover (e.g.,\nconversion of forest lands and grasslands to\ncropland and pasture, afforestation) cause\nchanges superimposed on natural carbon fluxes.\nLand is the critical resource for the AFOLU sector.\nIt provides food and fodder and it provides\nlivelihoods for people. Human economies and\nquality of life are directly dependent on the\nservices and the resources provided by land.\n\n80\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nIn Jordan, the natural ecosystems support human\nactivities in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,\ntourism, traditional and pharmaceutical health\nproducts, and traditional medicine, among others.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, less than\n5% of the country’s total area is arable land and\n90% is grazing land with 100-200 mm annual\nrainfall. Natural and human-made forests cover\naround 1% of the country’s area. The contribution\nof agriculture to the GDP in relative terms declined\nsharply from 40% in the 1950s to 4% in 2016.\nIrrespective of how humble the contribution of\nagriculture is to GDP and economic performance,\nfarming remains important. The importance of\nthe agricultural sector stems from the fact that\nit is not only a major source of food, particularly\ndairy products, fruits and vegetables, but it is also\na source of livelihood for 25% of the total poor\npopulation (livestock keepers, smallholder farm\nhouseholds, and landless former agriculturalists)\nliving in rural areas.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)\nstatistics 11% of the total country area is used\nas agriculture land and less than 1 % is forests\n(MoA, Annual Report, 2018). The country has three\ndistinguished bioclimatic zones namely:\n\nThe Jordan Valley, which forms a narrow strip\nthat is situated below the mean sea level with\nwarm winters and hot summers and where\nirrigation is practiced,\n\nThe western highlands, where annual\nprecipitation is in the range of 300 to 600\nmm,\n\nThe “Badia”, which includes the arid and semiarid areas in the eastern parts of the country,\nwhere the annual rainfall is below 200 mm.\nBadia is an Arabic word describing the open\nrangeland inhibited by Bedouins (nomads).\nAvailable governmental plans, programs, policies,\nand strategies announced and published by the\nMinistry of Agriculture, the Directorate of Forests,\nand other relevant institutions were reviewed.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture has just recently\npublished the 2020-2025 National Agricultural\nDevelopment Strategy focusing on the digitization\nand restructuring of the sector and boosting its\nproductivity.\nThe strategy identified a total of 174 interventions\nand projects that will be financed through a host\nof channels, including the Treasury; from the\nAgricultural Credit Corporation and from foreign\naid and grants.\nThe strategy has the following ambitious\nobjectives:\n\nIncreasing the agricultural GDP as a share\nof total GDP from 2.6 billion JD now to 3.66\nbillion JD by 2025 and boosting the addedvalue of agriculture to 2.48 billion JD from\n1.6 billion JD,\n\nIncreasing the forest area by 10% by 2025,\n\nExpanding pasture areas,\n\nCreating 65,000 jobs in the five-year period\nand replacing 21,000 foreign workers with\nJordanians,\n\nIncrease the number of farmers using digital\ngovernment-run agricultural services by 30\nper cent,\n\nReducing export costs to facilitate a 15 per\ncent increase in agricultural exports,\n\nIncrease the productivity of food and\nagricultural manufacturers by 18 per cent\nby 2025,\n\nThe utilization of modern technology to\nenhance production and productivity,\nfocusing on strategic crops,\nThe policy will address, as well, a number of\nchallenges facing the agricultural sector, among\nwhich:\n\nThe lack of comprehensive agricultural\ndatabases and poor utilization of modern\ntechnologies in agriculture that limited the\nagricultural producer’s access to retailers and\nconsumers,\n\n81\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nMarketing of products with the closure\nof neighboring markets due to regional\nconditions and the need to facilitate export\nof agricultural products through the Queen\nAlia International Airport (QAIA), \n\nLack of refrigerator trucks to transport fruit\nand vegetables ready for exporting,\n\nCompensating farmers for the damage to\ncrops because of frost,\n\nThe high cost of electricity for the agricultural\nsector,\n\nThe need to better manage the issue of nonJordanian workers in the sector, \n\nThe need to support livestock breeders with\nfeed, medicine and vaccines,\n\nIncrease in fodder prices due to delay and\ndecrease of rainfall.\nConsistent with these plans, the following is\nprojected as the baseline for AFOLU:\n\nField crops production: Increase productivity\nper unit area, promote water harvesting\ntechniques to expand planting areas, and\nmaintain productivity under predicted\ndecrease in rainfall,\n\nAnimal production: Promote high productive\nanimal species, under increase in prices of\nfodder, and other production inputs\n\nFodder\nproduction:\nReclamation\nof\nrangelands and control of overgrazing of\nrangelands, introduce species with high\nproductivity under drought conditions\nand promote wastewater reuse in fodder\nproduction,\n\nForestry conservation: Maintain forests which\nare threatened by predicted drought cycles,\nurban and rural expansion, expected fire\noccurrences, and illegal deforestation.\n3.3 Updates on the FBUR Mitigation Measures\nfor Different Sectors\nAccording to Annex III of Decision 2/CP.17 related to\nthe guidelines for the preparation of national BURs,\nnon-annex I parties should provide information,\nin a tabular format, on actions to mitigate climate\nchange, by addressing anthropogenic emissions\nby sources and removals by sinks of all GHGs not\ncontrolled by the Montreal Protocol.\nIn the preparation of this chapter of Jordan’s SBUR,\nall mitigation projects included in the FBUR have\nbeen reviewed and assessed to identify those\noptions considered to be still valid and applicable.\nThe cost-benefit analysis and the CO2 emissions\nreduction have been updated for each valid\nmitigation project. Net present value was used\nin the financial calculations, by converting all\npresent and future revenues and costs over the\nlifetime of the project to a base of today’s cost.\nThe same approach was followed in calculating\nCO2 emissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nproposed projects. A discount rate of 8% was used\nin all calculations of cost and emissions reduction.\nThe discounted unit cost of reduced emissions\nwhich is the quotient of the discounted cost to\nthe discounted emissions reduction was also\ncalculated.\nThe updated mitigation measures include GHG\nmitigation projects in the following areas:\n\nPrimary energy,\n\nRenewable energy,\n\nEnergy efficiency,\n\nIndustrial processes,\n\nWaste,\n\nAgriculture and forestry.\nThe results of the mitigation measures update is\npresented in the following sub-sections.\n3.3.1 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor primary energy\nThe GHG mitigation measures in the primary\nenergy demand and supply that were considered\nin the FBUR have been reviewed and assessed.\nAll information is presented in a tabular format\nin Appendix A, Table A.1. Table 3.4 is a summary\nof the FBUR mitigation projects and their current\nstatus.\n\n82\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.4: Status of the primary energy mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution Network\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nDemand Side Management\nCanceled from NEPCO’s implementation plan\nsince the different components of the project\nwill be implemented by JREEEF/MEMR through\nits Action Plan.\nAdding a 100 MW Combined Cycle in Samra\nPower Plant\nImplemented. It was modified to 70 MW instead\nof 100 MW and completely implemented by the\nyear 2018. According to the modification, the\ntotal estimated GHG emission reduction is 2066\nthousand tonnes CO2eq (kt CO2eq) during 25\nyears from 2018- 2043. The estimated emission\nreduction unit cost is - 33.77 JD/tonne of CO2eq.\nThus, the following two primary energy projects\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. The two mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution (T&D) Network, This project seeks\nto reduce the transmission and distribution\nlosses to 9% in 2027 compared to 13.3% in\n2020. The project will be executed gradually\nover a period of 6 years starting in 2022.\nThe main components of the project will\nbe optimizing the utilization of distributed\ngeneration, improving the system power\nfactor, upgrading or replacing existing\nconductors and insulators with lowerresistance equipment. The cost is estimated\nto be 48 Million USD. This project can lead to a\nsignificant reduction in fuel consumption and\nas a result a discounted emission reduction\nof 1,956 thousand tonnes of CO2 through the\n25 years, lifetime of the project (2022-2047),\n\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa, and Aqaba, According to the energy\nstrategy 2020-2030, Jordan will enhance\nthe usage of natural gas in all sectors such\nas Industrial, Residential, Commercial and\nTransportation. This includes the use of natural\ngas instead of liquefied petroleum gas for\ncooking, diesel in central heating and water\nheating and gasoline for cars. In 2020, 86%\nof the electricity generation of the Kingdom\nis generated from imported natural gas. To\ndeliver natural gas to smaller customers it will\nbe necessary to construct new low-pressure\ngas distribution networks to connect\ncustomers to the new infrastructure.\n The project will be executed gradually over\n10 years, starting in 2025 and with a capital\ncost of 110 million USD.\n Natural gas combustion emits 1.3 times less\nCO2 than that of oil, which indicates that\nusing natural gas in demand side sector as an\nalternative for diesel, fuel oil, LPG and gasoline,\nwill mitigate a significant quantity of CO2\nemissions. Using the natural gas distribution\nnetworks in the main cities of Amman, Zarqa,\nand Aqaba will mitigate about 2,708 thousand\ntonnes of CO2eq discounted emissions in the\n25 years of the project lifetime (2025-2050).\n The costs and CO2 emissions reduction for the\ntwo valid projects have been analyzed. Table\n3.5 shows a summary of the results.\n\n83\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.5: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne CO2eq) for the\nprimary energy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emission reductions\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission\nand Distribution Network\n1,956\n- 108.52\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\n2,708\n-13.78\n3.3.2 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor renewable energy (RE)\nRenewable energy (RE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed. All information is presented\nin a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.2. Table\n3.6 is a summary of their current status.\nTable 3.6: Status of RE mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\nSolar Water Heaters 2-30,000 Houses\nImplemented in four stages by JREEEF/MEMR during\nthe period 2017-2020.\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. Postponed to\nstart in the year 2022 instead of 2020.\n120 MW PV – Wheeling and Net Metering\nImplemented by MEMR during the period 2017-2020.\nThus, the following three renewable energy\nprojects are still valid and moved from FBUR to\nbe updated and considered in this SBUR. The three\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nConcentrating solar power (CSP) systems\nwork by concentrating the sun’s rays using\nmirrors to create heat, then the created heat\nis transferred to a heat transfer fluid. Electricity\nis then generated in a steam cycle, using the\nheat transfer fluid to create steam and generate\nelectricity as in conventional thermal power\nplants.\nConcentrated solar plants today typically include\nlow-cost thermal storage systems to decouple\ngeneration from the sun. Most commonly, a twotank molten salt storage system is used. CSP\nsystems are classified into line concentrating\nand focal concentrating systems referring to\nthe arrangements of concentrating mirrors.\nThe most widely deployed linear concentrating\nsystems are parabolic trough collectors while\nsolar towers are the most widely deployed focal\n\n84\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nconcentrating systems. It is expected that the\nconcentrated technology will play a major role\nin producing electricity with an increasing use\nof thermal storage to utilize excess heat during\nnight time to ensure the continuity of power\nproduction.\nThe capital cost of CSP represented by the\nunit cost of kW is decreasing with time. The\nreported global weighted- average cost of\nCSP commissioned in 2019 was USD 5,774/\nkW which is 36% lower than in 2010. Also,\nthe capacity factor increased to reach 45% in\n2019 with storage capacities from 4 to 8 hours.\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) costs that\ninclude insurance, and receivers and mirrors\nreplacements are substantial compared to solar\nPV and onshore wind energy but these costs\nare also declining with time. The typical costs\nof O&M of plants in operation today are in the\nrange of USD 0.02/kWh to USD 0.04/kWh (REVE\nmagazine, 2020).\nThe proposed capacity of this project will be\n100 MW and its capital cost, O&M costs, and\ncapacity factor are assumed to be the same as\nthose reported in 2019. The estimated annual\nelectricity production is around 394,200,000\nkWh and the capital cost is around 410 million\nJD. The estimated total discounted emission\nreduction is 1929.37 thousand tonnes CO2eq\nduring the 25 years of the project lifetime (20232047).\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nThis project is expected to be constructed in\n2028. In 2028, it is expected that the capital cost\nof CSP technology will decline by time and will\nreach 4,000 USD/kW while capacity factor will\nincrease to reach 70%. O&M cost is assumed\nto decrease to 0.01 USD/kW. The proposed\ncapacity of this project will be 300 MW with\nan estimated annual electricity production of\naround 1,708,200,000 kWh and a capital cost\nof around million JD 840. The estimated total\ndiscounted emission reduction is 9,003.71\nthousand tonnes CO2eq during the 25 years of\nthe project lifetime (2028-2052).\nSolar Water Heaters 3 – 30,000 houses\nThis mitigation project is similar to the previous\nsolar water heaters (SWH) projects which were\nproposed earlier in TNC and FBUR and were\nsuccessfully implemented by JREEEF/MEMR\nthroughout 2017-2020. This proposed project\nis planned to be implemented over three years\n2022- 2025 with a lifetime of 25 years 2022-2046.\nSWH saves electric energy used to heat water\nfor domestic use. It is assumed that SWH will\nreplace electric heaters and every house requires\na solar water heater of 4.6 m2 and every m2 can\nproduce around 740 kWh/yr. This proposed\nproject includes the installation of 30,000 solar\nwater heaters; the cost of each is 500 JD. The\ninstalled capacity of this project will be 54 MW\nwith an estimated annual electricity reduction of\naround 102 GWh. The estimated total discounted\nemission reduction is 457.53 thousand tonnes\nCO2eq during the 25 years of the project lifetime\n(2022-2046).\nThe cost and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nthree valid renewable energy projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.7.\nTable 3.7: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for renewable\nenergy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions reduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n1,929.37\n118.68\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n9,003.71\n- 7.18\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\n457.51\n-189.95\n\n85\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.3 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor energy efficiency (EE)\nEnergy Efficiency (EE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed. All information is presented\nin a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.3. Table\n3.8 is a summary of their current status.\nTable 3.8: Status of the energy efficiency (EE) mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nReplacing high thermal mass with low\nthermal mass (LTM) in ceramic factories\nNot valid. This project was originally proposed to be\nimplemented in 5 Ceramic companies, however, the\nmain Ceramic company in Zarqa and most of other\nceramic industries closed due to high competition of\nimported Ceramic especially from Egypt.\nReturning un-returned condensate to the\nfeed water tanks in food industry\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nInsulating the un-insulated pipes, fittings\nand tanks in food industries\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.

The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nStreet lighting: replacing 125 W Mercury\nlamps with 70 W high pressure Sodium\nlamps\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nsuch as GAM during the period 2017-2020.\nUsing regenerative burners instead of\nconventional burners in Steel Reheating\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nUsing variable speed drives in the paper\nfactories pumps\nNot valid. This project was originally proposed to be\nimplemented in paper factories that produce paper\npulp, however, most of these factories are currently\nclosed and ready paper pulp is imported for further\nprocessing.\nLED lighting in public buildings\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nduring the period 2017-2020.\nImproving energy efficiency in small and\nmedium size hotels\nUnder implementation by JREEEF/MEMR as planned,\nduring the period 2017-2020, 16 small and medium\nhotels participated in this program\nLED lighting in households\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nduring the period 2017-2020.\nThus, the following four energy efficiency projects\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. The four mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed\nwater tanks in food industry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, condensate resulting from the\n\n86\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\ncondensation of steam is drained without the\nutilization of its heat. Therefore, returning this\ncondensate to the boiler feed water tank will\nsave energy represented by the saved heavy\nfuel oil to operate the boiler in addition to\nsaving in the cost of water treatment and\nwater itself. It is assumed that 10 food factories\nwill implement this energy efficiency measure\nwith a discounted emission reduction of\n7,433.38 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fitting and tanks\nin food industries.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, the steam and condensate\npipes and valves, and feed water tank are\nuninsulated. Insulating them will save energy\nin the form of saved fuel used to power the\nsteam boiler. It is assumed that 10 food\nfactories will implement this energy efficiency\nmeasure with a discounted emission reduction\nof 8,243.32 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 new houses.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented in\nthree years starting from 2022 with a lifetime\nof 30 years. It is assumed that 80% of new\nresidential houses are not insulated, so out\nof 3,500 checked houses it is assumed that\nthe insulation of walls and roofs will have\nbeen implemented for 2,800 houses. It is also\nassumed that the saving from this measure is\nabout 50% of the annual heating and cooling\nbills in these houses. It is estimated that this\nenergy efficiency measure will result in a\ndiscounted emission reduction of 69,792.85\ntonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the project\n(2022-2051).\n\nUsing Regenerative Burners Instead of\nConventional Burners in Steel Reheating\nIndustry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 20 years. In steel\nfactories, the reheating furnace uses heavy\nfuel oil to reheat the steel billets, usually to\nform the steel into construction steel rods.\nHigh speed pressure jet burners are used\nfor this purpose. Using regenerative burners\ninstead of these conventional burners will\nresult in energy saving of around 10%. It is\nestimated that implementing this energy\nefficiency measure in 5 steel factories will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n72,093.67 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2041).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed EE projects have been analyzed. A\nsummary of the results is shown in Table 3.9.\nTable 3.9: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nenergy efficiency mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions\nreduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water\ntanks in food industries\n7.43\n-108.04\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fittings, and tanks in\nfood industries\n8.24\n-215.16\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3500 new houses\n69.79\n-183.64\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional\nburners in steel reheating industries\n72.09\n-110.03\n\n87\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.4 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures for IPPU sector\nGHG mitigation options in the IPPU sector that were considered in the FBUR report have been reviewed\nand assessed. Relevant information is presented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.4. Table 3.10\nis a summary of their status.\nTable 3.10: Status of the IPPU mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the\nraw materials needed to produce clinker\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\ncement\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nof Pozzolana\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nUse of biomass (MSW or/and Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the nitric acid plant\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for IPPU\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. These mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute\nthe raw materials needed to produce clinker\nat the selected cement plant\nCertain steel slag and fly ash materials (decarbonated kiln feedstock) could be added to the\nraw material feed to reduce the amount of raw\nmaterial needed to produce a given amount of\nclinker. Jordan has more than 5 steel melting and\ngalvanizing factories, therefore there is an available\nstock of steel slag and fly ash to be used in the\ncement industry.\nIn this mitigation project, it is suggested to produce\na new type of cement CEM V (Composite Cement)\nat one of the cement industries; mainly the one that\nhas a neighboring steel manufacturing company\nand can try the production of this type of cement\nwith minor additional costs in comparison to\nother existing companies. The percentages of\nblast-furnace slag and natural Pozzolana range\nbetween 31-49% each, to produce CEM V/B. A\n40% substitution of steel slag/fly ash and a 10%\nproduction of new CEM V/B will be assumed at\nthis company.\nThe price of steel slag and/or fly ash is estimated\nto be 42.3 JD/tonne. The cost of energy and raw\nmaterials reach 61% of total cost and based on\nthe assumption of a production cost of 89.7 JD/\ntonne of cement. This option will reduce the cost\nby 54.7 JD/tonne of cement. No annual increase\nin the production costs will be assumed for the\nproject lifetime. Investment cost to grind the steel\nslag will be estimated as 2,442,928 JD (based on\nthe maximum produced tonnes of CEM II in 2046)\nbased on the estimated cost of 1.37 USD/tonne\ncement.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 250,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022 - 2046)\n\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in\n\nCEM II\nBlended cement is a mixture of clinker and additives\ncontaining less than 95% clinker. Blended cement\ntypes are distinct products with different uses\nthat have different additives and different shares\nof clinker. More than 90% of cement produced at\nthe local cement companies is CEM II (Portland–\nPozzolana Cement) with a percentage of Pozzolana\n\n88\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nranges between 21-32%. Therefore; there is an area\nto increase the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\nby improving the reactivity of the produced clinker\nand the raw mix to produce CEM II/B-P to achieve\nthe required strength of 42.5N that cause the use\nof Pozzolana of less than 32% (the 3% is substituted\nby gypsum). A reasonable 2% more substitution\ncould be assumed on average and so a reduction\nof CO2 emissions by 2% could be assumed as well.\nSince all local cement companies produce CEM\nII, there is no need for investment to procure the\nequipment needed to receive, store, grind and\nmeter.\nPozzolana to the cement product. The operational\ncost includes the price of extraction of Pozzolana,\npaid to MEMR (previously payment was to the\nNatural Resources Authority) and transportation.\nHowever, this option will reduce the cost of raw\nmaterials (mainly limestone) and energy needed to\nproduce the saved clinker that will be substituted\nby Pozzolana.\nThe price of Pozzolana is estimated to be 36.6 JD/\ntonne. As mentioned above, this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement to save both\nenergy and raw materials and no extra investment\ncost is needed.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, it is\nexpected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is assumed\nto be 25 years.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 367,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022-2046)\n\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with\n45% of Pozzolana\nIt is estimated that 10% of currently produced CEM\nII/B-P will be changed to CEM IV, strength 22.5X in\nwhich the Pozzolana substitution will reach 45% (at\nleast 13% more (starting from approximately 32%).\nCO2 reduction will be calculated by multiplying the\nannual CO2 emissions by the reduced percentage of\n13%, this percentage will also be multiplied by the\npercentage of the products that will be converted\nfrom CEM II/B-P to CEM IV which is assumed to be\n10% of CEM II/B-P. Therefore; annual CO2 emissions\nfrom producing CEM II/B-P will be multiplied by\n1.3% to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction as\na result of implementing this option.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, marketing\nthe new product, and setting the legally binding\nregulations and enforcement measures to control\nits use, it is expected to start the implementation of\nthis project in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\nto be 25 years. The price of Pozzolana is estimated\nto be 36.6 JD/tonne and also this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement by savings in\nboth energy and raw materials, and with no extra\ninvestment. It is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 238,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nUse of biomass (MSW and/or Sewage Sludge)\nas alternative fuels\nA potential reduction of CO2 emissions in the\ncement industry could be achieved by switching\nfrom traditional fossil fuel to a biomass fuel.\nSince most local cement factories are licensed\nto burn coal, petcoke, oil shale and alternative\nfuels such as waste tires and used oil, to replace\nthe expensive heavy fuel oil, they are equipped\nwith multi-purpose burners which reduce the\ninvestment costs for using biomass as alternative\nfuels. However, the required capital cost depends\non the needed storage, segregation, handling,\ngrinding and metering as well as environmental\npollution control measures. A value of 27.5 JOD/\ntonne of alternative fuel is used to estimate the\ninvestment cost based on the maximum estimated\ntonnes needed in 2046. So, the investment cost for\nthis option is estimated at 129,942,957 JD.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, studies\nof the maximum percentage of MSW and dried\nsewage sludge to be used, availability of stocks\nin the market, testing the emissions, conduct EIA\nstudy and getting the environmental clearance;\nit is expected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\n\n89\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nto be 25 years. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 814,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the Nitric Acid plant\nThis project involves the installation of a new N2O\nabatement technology that is not commonly used\nin nitric acid plants. The abatement technology is\na pelleted catalyst that will be installed inside the\nammonia burner just underneath the precious\nmetal gauzes. This technology is capable of\nreducing approximately 75% to 80% of the N2O\nformed at the precious metal gauzes inside\nthe ammonia burner to atmospheric N2 and O2\n(through communication with KEMAPCO).\nThe selected N2O abatement technology depends\non replacing some of the Al2O3 balls that support\nthe platinum-rhodium catalyst by a base metal\nsecondary catalyst, which is capable of reducing\nN2O by at least 75%.\nThis project will only be implemented for the sake\nof GHG emissions reduction; there are no other\ndirect benefits. Therefore, its implementation is\nstrongly dependent on the provision of economic\nincentives. The project is assumed to start in 2022\nand its lifetime is estimated to be the same as the\nlifetime of the KEMAPCO plant, which is estimated\nto be 25 years (till the year 2046). It is estimated\nthat implementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n1,659,000 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2046).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed IPPU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.11.\nTable 3.11: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nIPPU mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost\n(JD/tonne of\nCO2eq)\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw\nmaterials needed to produce clinker\n250\n-22.9\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II cement\n367\n-32.1\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nPozzolana\n238\n-32.0\nUse of biomass (MSW and/ or Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\n814\n-69.3\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia burner\nof the nitric acid plant\n1,659\n0.37\n3.3.5 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor AFOLU sector\nThe main mitigation options within AFOLU mainly\ninvolve one or more of three strategies:\n\nReduction/prevention of emissions to the\natmosphere by conserving existing carbon\npools in soils or vegetation that would\notherwise be lost, or by reducing emissions\nof CH4 and N2O,\n\nSequestration—enhancing the uptake of\ncarbon in terrestrial reservoirs, and thereby\nremoving CO2 from the atmosphere,\n\n90\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nReducing CO2 emissions by introducing\nchanges within demand-side options (e.g., by\nlifestyle changes, reducing losses and waste\nof food, changes in human diet, changes in\nwood consumption).\nGHG mitigation options in the AFOLU sector that\nwere considered in the FBUR report have been\nreviewed and updated. Relevant information is\npresented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table\nA.5. Table 3.12 is a summary of their status.\nTable 3.12: Status of the AFOLU mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in urban areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in northern area\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 1- Restoration of rangeland areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 2- New protected rangeland area as\nnatural reserve\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nPromoting for climate-smart agricultural practices in\nthe Jordan Valley\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for\nAFOLU are still valid. The projects will be modified\nand updated to be considered in this SBUR. These\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n\nIntroduce new trees plantation in Urban Areas\nLosses in urban trees are a continuous concern\neither due to snow storms, or from burning, and\ncutting due to land use change. No official numbers\nhave been published, but it was assumed that an\naverage loss of around 2,500 trees within Greater\nAmman Municipality area will be compensated\nfor, mostly by planting pine and coniferous trees.\nA medium growth coniferous tree, planted in an\nurban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years,\nsequesters 0.060-tonnes CO2 per planted tree. It\nis estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 1,502 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of\nthe project (2022 – 2042).\n\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in\nNorthern\nArea\nLosses in forest trees are a continuous concern,\neither due to snow storms, burning or illegal cutting.\nNo official numbers have been published regarding\nthe loss, but it was assumed that an average loss\nof around 30,000 trees within the Northern Area\nwill be compensated for, mostly by planting pine\nand coniferous trees. A medium growth coniferous\ntree, planted in an urban setting and allowed to\ngrow for 10 years, sequesters 0.060-tonne CO2 per\nplanted tree. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 11,923 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2042).\n\nRangeland restoration and increase in forage\nproduction Projects\nThe projects suggest that the Ministry of Agriculture\nestablish a public corporation responsible for\nforage production and sales to livestock owners.\nThe corporation will be responsible for buying the\nplants and for hiring labor for cultivation.\nTwo areas for production will be considered:\n Rangelands Project 1: Restoration of\nRangeland Areas and Rangelands\n\n50,000 dunums in the Badia (Al Jafr and\nAl Husseinieh) sub-districts within the\nMa’an Governorate. It is assumed that the\nproductivity of these area will be 50 kg/\ndunum of dry matter (in areas with 100200 mm rainfall). Suggested plant types are\nperennial fodder shrubs. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n888,140 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2036).\n\n91\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nProject 2: New Protected Rangeland Area\n as Natural Reserve combined\n100,000 dunums in the wide desert valleys of\nsouth Badia. The average annual dry matter\nproduction is 4 kg/dunum in normal years\nand with good restoration practices, the\nproductivity can be increased to 15 kg/dunum.\nThe project will harness direct benefits for\nprotection of floral biodiversity through\ncontrolling the grazing of the indigenous\nAtriplex halimus shrubs. Much of this area is\ncovered with chert and an underlying thin\nlayer of fine textured soil. Artemisia herba-\nalba, Retama raetam, Achillea fragrantissima,\nAtriplex halimus and Poa bulbosa are common\nin the wadi beds. Despite its deterioration this\nregion is known to be the main grazing land\nin Jordan.\nIt is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 1,776,280 tonnes CO2\nover the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2036).\nThe projects will achieve reductions through CO2\nemissions offset from natural soil carbon release\ncaused by rangeland deterioration. The project will\nharness direct benefit for soil resources through\nrain harvest techniques as well as soil erosion\ncontrol techniques (erosion is caused by flow from\nflash floods). It is assumed to have an average of 35\naverage sized shrub/dunum and the sequestration\nrate is 5.57 tonnes SOC/ha/year and a lifetime of\n15 years will be assumed for calculation purposes.\n\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices\nin the Jordan Valley\nClimate smart agriculture is not a new agricultural\nsystem, nor is it a set of practices. It is a new approach,\na way to guide the needed changes of agricultural\nsystems, given the necessity to jointly address food\nsecurity and climate change. It contributes to the\nachievement of sustainable development goals\nand integrates the three dimensions of sustainable\ndevelopment (economic, social and environmental)\nby jointly addressing food security and climate\nchallenges. It is composed of three main pillars:\nSustainably increasing agricultural productivity\nand incomes; adapting and building resilience\nto climate change; reducing and/or removing\ngreenhouse gases emissions, where possible.\nSustainable crop production, controlled grazing\nand maintained forest systems can sequester\nsubstantial and variable amounts of carbon from\nthe atmosphere and store it in soils and vegetation.\nCarbon sequestration will not only stabilize climate\nbut will also increase the overall resilience of the\nagro-ecosystems. Widespread adoption of climate-\nsmart practices has the potential to make major\ncontributions to the achievement of national food\nsecurity and development goals. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will result in\na discounted emission reduction of 13,057 tonnes\nCO2 over the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2026).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nproposed AFOLU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed.

These mitigation projects\nare briefly described below.\n\nBiogas collection and utilization from AlDhulil domestic solid waste landfill. A\nconsiderable amount of biogas could only\nbe generated from Al-Dulail landfill while\nAl-Karak, Al-Salt and Madaba domestic solid\nwaste landfill sites were considered not valid\ndue to low production of gas in those sites.\n\nThe proposed project aims at collecting the\ngenerated biogas, treating it for impurities,\ngenerating electricity using biogas generator\nand connecting the generated electricity to\nthe national electricity grid. The suggested\nproject will contribute to reducing the\namount of fuel used for electricity generation.\nThe starting year for implementing this\nproject is 2022 and construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year,\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nproject will be in 2023. The lifetime of the\nproject is 25 years ( 2022 – 2047).\n\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge\ngenerated from the domestic wastewater\ntreatment plants. The project was considered\nto be valid for Wadi Arab, Baqa’a, and\nMadaba domestic wastewater treatment\nplants and thus emission reductions were\nrecalculated while it was considered invalid\nfor Ramtha and Salt due to decreased inflow\nof wastewater to these treatment plants.\n\nThe proposed projects aim at generating\nbiogas from the sludge and connecting\nthe generated electricity to the national\nelectricity\ngrid.\nThese\nprojects\nwill\ncontribute to reducing the amount of fuel\nused for electricity generation, taking into\nconsideration that a considerable amount\nof sludge produced from the wastewater\ntreatment plants without any utilization.\nIn the three projects of Wadi Arab, Baqa’a,\nand Madaba the construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nprojects will be the next year. The starting\nyear for implementing the proposed projects\nin Madaba and Wadi Al Arab is 2021 for a\nlifetime of 25 years (2021 to 2046) while the\nproject in Baqa’a will be implemented in 2025\nfor a lifetime of 25 years (2025 to 2049).\nThe following assumptions were used during the\nupdate of waste projects:\n\nTotal amount of organic material generated\nis assumed to increase annually by 2.2%,\n\nDensity of methane is 0.717 kg/m3,\n\nThe captured methane from all landfills\nis calculated according to the PRIF study\n(Environment and use of methane from\nmunicipal waste in Amman, 1993), where\nthe average value is used,\n\nElectricity grid emission factor is considered\nto be 0.4585 kgCO2/KWh,\n\nThe calculation of generated electricity in MW\nis based on 8,000 working hours per year,\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nsludge produced at wastewater treatment\nplants is assumed to be sold at a fixed price of\n0.094 JD/kWh (each kW produced is assumed\nto replace 1kw sold from the electricity grid),\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nbiogas produced from landfills is assumed\nto be sold at a fixed price of 0.06 JD/kWh,\n\nThe cost of a 1 MW biogas electricity\ngeneration landfill system (generator, wells,\npiping, etc.) is 1.5 million JD, according to\nthe International Renewable Energy Agency\n(IRENA),\n\nThe cost of 1 MW biogas electricity generation\nfrom biogas system (digester, WWTP\ngenerator, piping, etc.) is 4 million JD (Jordan\nbiogas project),\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of\nmaintenance, operation, overheads and\nsupervision costs (3% of capital cost) in\nwastewater\ntreatment\nplant\nsystems,\n\n94\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of maintenance,\noperation, overheads, and supervision costs\nin biogas projects in landfills (5% of capital\ninvestment, according to IRENA).\nAll mitigation options under the waste sector were\nconsidered as energy measures because the biogas\nwill be used for electric power generation. The cost\nand the CO2 emission reductions are analyzed for\nthe 5 proposed projects. A summary of the results\nis shown in the following table 3.15.\nTable 3.15: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nwaste mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost (JD/\ntonne of CO2eq)\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil\ndomestic solid waste landfill\n1,003.66\n- 0.50\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Wadi Arab domestic wastewater treatment\nplant\n280.30\n- 4.00\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Baqa’a tertiary domestic wastewater\ntreatment plant\n188.03\n4.48\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated\nfrom Maddaba domestic wastewater treatment\nplant\n188.23\n4.54\n3.3.7 Main results of updating the FBUR mitigation measures\n3.3.7.1 GHG emissions reduction of the updated measures\nTwenty three GHG mitigation projects out of the 39 projects that were proposed previously in the FBUR\nare still valid. The yearly GHG emission reductions were recalculated for each mitigation measure over\nits lifetime. Table 3.16, shows the total GHG emission reductions of the 23 measures for selected years.\nTable 3.16: GHG total emissions reductions (Gg of CO2eq) from the updated measures for selected years\nYear\nTotal GHG Emissions Reductions of the 23 updated measures\n(Gg of CO2eq)\n2025\n1,511.45\n2030\n2,487.75\n2035\n2,591.57\n2040\n2,400.42\n2045\n3,228.82\n2050\n1,220.47\n\n95\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.7.2 GHG abatement cost analysis for the\nupdated projects\nGHG abatement cost was recalculated for the 23\nprojects in addition to the yearly and reduced\nemission reductions. These projects belong to\nseveral sectors and subsectors including primary\nenergy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste,\nand agriculture.\nIt is concluded from the abatement cost analysis\nfor the updated FBUR valid projects that the most\nfeasible options are the energy mitigation projects.\nThe findings indicated that in particular the energy\nefficiency should receive the most attention. Table\n3.17 shows the abatement marginal cost for all\nmitigation measures ranked from the highest\nto the lowest and figure 3.1 shows the updated\nmitigation projects grouped by sector.\nFigure 3.1 Abatement marginal cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for all updated mitigation measures grouped by sector\n Legend: AGRI- AFOLU projects, waste- waste projects, IPPU- Industrial Processes projects, RE- Renewable Energy Projects,\nEE- Energy Efficiency Projects and PE-Primary Energy Projects)\n\n96\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.17: All updated mitigation projects ranked from the highest GHG reduction cost (JD/tonne CO2eq) to\nthe lowest cost\nProject Name\nEmissions\nReduction Unit\nCost (JD/tonne\nof CO2eq)\n1\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 1)\n118.68\n2\nForestry- Introduction of new plantations in Urban Areas\n40.00\n3\nRangeland 1- Restoration of Rangeland Areas\n18.00\n4\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Northern Area\n14.50\n5\nRangeland 2- New Protected Rangeland Area as Natural Reserve\n10.00\n6\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Madaba\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.54\n7\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Baqa’a tertiary\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.48\n8\nCatalytic Reduction of N2O inside the Ammonia Burner of the Nitric Acid\nPlant\n0.37\n9\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil domestic solid waste\nlandfill\n-0.50\n10\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Wadi Arab\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n-4.00\n11\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 2)\n-7.18\n12\nNatural gas distribution network in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\n-13.78\n13\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw materials needed to\nproduce clinker\n-22.90\n14\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45% of Pozzolana\n-32.00\n15\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\n-32.10\n16\nUse of biomass (domestic solid waste or/and sewage sludge) as\nalternative fuels in cement plants\n-69.30\n17\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water tanks in food\nindustry\n-108.04\n18\nLoss reduction in transmission and distribution\n-108.52\n19\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional burners in steel\nindustry\n-110.03\n20\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 houses\n-183.64\n21\nSolar water heaters 3- 30,000 houses\n-189.95\n22\nInsulating pipes, fittings and tanks in food industries\n-215.16\n23\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices in the Jordan valley\n-1333.00\n\n97\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nReferences\n\nAshley Murray and Lynn Price, 2008.

Some of these elements are implemented at\nthe international level and others at the national\nlevel.\nAt the international level, the MRV framework for\ndeveloping countries includes:\n\nGuidance on reporting through National\nCommunications (NCs) and Biennial Update\nReports (BURs),\n\nGuidance on setting up domestic MRV\nframeworks,\n\nA process for consideration of information\nsubmitted by developing countries in their\nBURs through an International Consultant\nand Analysis (ICA),\n\nInternational guidance on MRV for those\ndeveloping\ncountries\nthat\nvoluntarily\nimplement reforestation and avoided\ndeforestation activities and wish to take the\nopportunity of a results-based payment.\nAt the national level, Parties to the UNFCCC\nare expected to implement these international\nguidance and to prepare and report information\nevery two years through their NCs and BURs.\nThe list of information elements to be reported\nincludes annual GHG emissions inventories,\nmitigation actions and their estimated effects, as\nwell as technical and financial support needed and\nreceived. Jordan was among the first developing\ncountries to submit its first NC under the UNFCCC\nin 1997.\nMRV is central to effectively implement the NDCs,\nwhich describes countries mitigation goals and\npolicies submitted under the Paris Agreement.\nMeasurement is needed to identify emissions\ntrends, determine where to focus Green House\nGas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts, track\nmitigation-related support, assess whether\nmitigation actions planned under the NDCs\nare effective, evaluate the impact of support\nreceived, and monitor progress achieved in\nreducing emissions. Reporting and verification\nare important for ensuring transparency, good\ngovernance, accountability, and credibility of\nresults, and for building confidence that resources\nare being utilized effectively.\nAt COP 13, through the Bali Action Plan, Parties\nagreed on the principle of applying MRV for\ndeveloping country Parties, which laid the\nfoundation for the subsequent elaboration of\nthe existing comprehensive MRV framework for\ndeveloping country Parties. MRV occurs at the\ninternational level, but can also be voluntary at\nthe national level.\n4.2 Jordan’s multi-tiered MRV system\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its Market Readiness Proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\n(PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined a plan for\nimplementing the market readiness components\nthat will be necessary to support the development\nof appropriate market based instruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n\nA national MRV system and registry for\nclimate\nmitigation\nmeasures,\n\nDesigning a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n\nExploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\n\n101\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith developing a multi-tiered integrated MRV\nsystem. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE); adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors and will serve in tracking progress\ntowards Nationally Determined Contribution\n(NDC) commitments.\nThe main functions of the system are shown in\nthe figure below (adopted from PMR initiative\nbrochure, 2018), and they are described briefly\nin the subsequent sections.\nFigure 4.1: The main functions of the MRV system (adopted from PMR initiative Brochure, 2018).\nData Extracting, Transforming & Loading:\nthe system acts as database for GHG emissions\nat project, ministry, sectoral and national levels,\nwith main functions of; metadata1 viewing and\nediting, reference2 data monitoring, emissions\ndata monitoring and uploading data in a standard\nformat or automatically importing data.\nData Processing: the system provides a database\nof validated emissions and reduction, with main\nfunctions of pre-determined calculations of data\ncompared to previous years and calculation of\nGHGs and emission reduction based on proxy\ndata3 and modelled scenarios.\n2.

Also,\nnon-Annex I parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity-building and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility,\nParties included in Annex II to the Convention\nand other developed country Parties, the Green\nClimate Fund and multilateral institutions for\nactivities relating to climate change, including for\nthe preparation of the current biennial update\nreport.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nAccordingly, this chapter aims at providing a\nbrief description of the constraints and gaps\nidentified in previous national climate change\ncommunications and the First Biennial Update\nReport (FBUR). It will also identify newly arising\nconstraints and gaps, and needed actions and\nresources required to overcome them.\n5.2 Institutional Constraints and Gaps and\nPolicy Mainstreaming\n5.2.1 Current institutional arrangements\nClimate change (CC) Directorate, Environment Law\nNo. 6/2017 and CC bylaw No.79/2019.\nThe Directorate of Climate Change was established\nat the MoEnv in 2014 to act as the institutional hub\nfor coordinating and developing all climate change\nactivities in Jordan in relation to the UNFCCC and\nthe global climate change governance system and\ninitiatives.\nJordan has issued in May 2017 a new Environmental\nProtection Law (No.6/2017) that mandates the\nMoEnv to “coordinate national efforts to project\nClimate Change impacts, identify the sectors\naffected, and limit and mitigate greenhouse gas\nemissions by means such as funding, technology\ntransfer and reallocation of available funding and\nits distribution to Climate Change activities”.\nAnother significant milestone, is the issuance of\nthe Climate Change Bylaw No. 79 in 2019 which\nwas adopted pursuant to article no. 30(a) of the\nEnvironmental Protection Law No. 6/2017. The\nBylaw came as a response to the need to define\na framework that establishes a clear institutional\nsetting to address climate change challenges\nand ensure full engagement of all partners and\nstakeholders including both the technical experts\nand the decision makers.\nUnder the provisions of this bylaw, a National\nClimate Change Committee (NCCC) has been\nformed. This Committee is chaired by the Minister\nof Environment and consists of the secretary\ngenerals and high level members from the related\ninstitutions.\nThe bylaw identified the responsibility of the\nMoEnv as UNFCCC focal point to:\na. Seek approval from the NCCC on proposed\npolicies and strategies to adapt to the\nnegative impacts of climate change, and\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to be\nsubmitted to the Cabinet for adoption and\ninclusion in sectoral policies and strategies,\nb.\nPrepare nationally determined contributions,\nnational communication reports, biennial\nupdate reports, national adaptation plans\nand other climate change relevant documents\nand update them according to international\nconventions and obligations,\nc. Represent the Kingdom in international\nclimate change commissions and conferences,\nd.\nCreate and manage a national inventory\ndatabase to document emissions data,\nmitigation and adaptation measures and\nclimate finance data,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n107\ne. Authorize accredited entities to verify the\nresults of national inventory reports according\nto a criteria that will be set for this purpose,\nf. Provide technical support to scientific research\ncentres through opening up channels of\ncommunication with equivalent international\nclimate research centres,\ng.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders to\ndevelop a national climate finance plan, that\nidentifies projects, programmes and plans of\npriority,\nh.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders with\nregard to climate change market mechanisms.\nIn addition to the NCCC, technical teams are\nnominated according to specific needs; consisting\nof experts and specialists from governmental\norganizations, scientific research institutions, civil\nsociety organizations, and other related entities\nidentified in the bylaw.\nAlso, the bylaw set a group of entities mandated to\nsupport the MoEnv with providing data, available\nat their entities, needed for GHG inventory\nestimation, NDCs and financial support tracking.\nEstablishment of Green Economy Unit\nA Green Economy Unit was established at the\nMoEnv in 2014, with the purpose of coordinating\nthe national efforts regarding developing and\nupdating the green economy national strategies\nand legislation in accordance with the sectoral\nneeds. This unit works hand in hand with the\nClimate Change Directorate (CCD) to support\nenvironmental and climate action in Jordan, while\nalso achieving sustainable economic green growth\nobjectives.\nIn 2017 and with the support of Global Green\nGrowth Institute (GGGI) and UNEP, a National\nGreen Growth strategy, was published, it has\nidentified green growth as a top national priority.\nThen, recently in 2020, the Green Growth National\nAction Plans for (2021-2025) was launched for\nsix main sectors (energy, waste, water, transport,\nagriculture and tourism).\nNDC Partnership\nIn March 2017, Jordan through the MoEnv joined\nthe NDC Partnership as a member country, Jordan\nbecame a part of the global coalition of 130\ncountries and institutions working together to\nmobilize support and achieve ambitious climate\ngoals. As a global coalition emerging from the\nParis Agreement, the NDC Partnership works with\nJordan to shift the NDC’s focus from commitment\nto implementation, supporting fast-tracked,\nenhanced NDC implementation. By facilitating and\ncoordinating the delivery of technical and financial\nsupport and knowledge services, the Partnership\naims to bridge Jordan’s NDC implementation\nneeds with Partnership resources.\nTo accelerate the implementation of its NDC, the\nGovernment of Jordan (GoJ) unveiled its NDC\nAction Plan in April 2019. Jordan’s NDC Action\nPlan is a detailed statement of measures aligned\nwith the mitigation and adaptation objectives\nstated in its NDC. It offers a concrete roadmap\nfor transitioning to a low-emissions and climate\nresilient economy by increasing the share of\nrenewables in the energy mix and scaling up\nenergy efficiency measures; adapting to the\nimpacts of climate change in water, agricultural\nand health sectors; and strengthening the\nresilience of vulnerable groups and ecosystems.\nThe measures listed in the Action Plan are at\ndifferent stages of development and require\ndifferent types of support, including technical\nsupport for feasibility studies, developing\nfinancing strategies, monitoring and evaluation\nservices, and financial support for implementation\nof the investment ready measures.\nMainstreaming climate change at the national\nlevel\nOn the national level many institutions made\nconsiderable progress in including climate\nchange in their entities mandates. Many\nnational institutions established climate change\ndirectorates or units to follow up with Ministry of\nEnvironment, such as the ministries of Agriculture,\nWater and Irrigation, Transport, The National\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n108\nAgriculture Research Centre, and The Royal\nJordanian Geographic Centre.\nAlso, recently the Ministry of Environment\nsigned an agreement with King Abdullah II\nCentre for Excellence to update the Environment\nSustainability Award for industries to enhance their\ncommitments towards environment protection\nincluding the reduction of GHGs.\nThe private sector is engaging as well, with a\nunit for energy and environmental sustainability\nestablished in Jordan Chamber of Industry,\nthrough which they work with the industries\nand the government to encourage low emission\ntechnologies.\nOne of the most recent strategies that was recently\nlaunched, is the National Energy Strategy 2020\n– 2030. This strategy aims to reduce the CO2\nemissions by 10% by 2030. Also the Agriculture\nDevelopment National Strategy 2020-2025\nfocused on adaptation and the impacts of climate\nchange on biodiversity and land degradation.\nAt the city level, Greater Amman Municipality in\ncooperation with Ministry of Environment and\nWorld Bank launched in 2018 “Amman Climate\nPlan - A Vision for 2050 Amman”. This inaugural\nplan sets an interim target of a 40% reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This plan sets\nout a shared vision for collaboration among the\ngovernment, private sector, development partners\nand residents of Amman. This plan is a living,\nevolving document that the city will continue to\nbuild on until reaching a carbon-neutral city in\n2050.\n5.2.2 Identified gaps and constraints and\nrecommendations to address them\nThe CCD at Ministry of Environment, as UNFCCC\nfocal point, plays a pivotal role in climate change\nactivities at the national level. However, the\ndirectorate needs strengthening in term of human\nresources and sustainability. It is recommended\nto increase the number of the staff and enhance\ntheir capacity to be able to carry out their huge\nresponsibilities in the long term.\nAlthough the climate change bylaw was issued\nin 2019, it is not fully functioning yet. Up to date,\nthe number of meetings, between the NCCC and\nthe technical teams is not sufficient and no major\ndecisions have been taken on the ground. Also,\nthere are entities identified in Annex (3) of the\nbylaw who are responsible for providing needed\ndata for the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory\nestimation, however, only a slight improvement\nwas detected in providing and facilitating\ncollection of data and still more collaboration is\nneeded.\nThe following are some recommendations to\nenact and activate the bylaw, its committee and\ntechnical groups:\n\nIt is recommended that MoEnv as chair of\nthe NCCC highlights continually the role of\ndifferent ministries and institutions in the\narea of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n\nSeek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to the climate change bylaw, in\nareas relevant to their roles,\n\nIt is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at\nleast 3 years) to be able to strengthen their\nwork and it’s highly recommended to prepare\ntheir successors in advance,\n\nCCDs at different ministries and institutions\nare important vehicles to mainstream climate\nchange into the strategies and policies of\ntheir respective institutions. As such, it is\nrecommend that the MoEnv coordinates\ncontinuously with these departments and\nsupports them in identifying their capacity\nbuilding needs.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n109\n5.3 Technical and Capacity Building Needs\n5.3.1 Identified gaps and capacity building needs\nthrough the Technical Analysis- ICA process\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the\nUNFCCC was prepared and submitted in late 2017.\nAfter its submission, a Team of Technical Experts\n(TTE) were formed by the UNFCCC secretariat to\nperform review. These experts were trained to\nconduct reviews as part of the ICA according to\nDecision 2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s first BUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify capacity-building needs\nof developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NCs:\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series;\nb.\nDevelop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources;\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis;\nd.\nDevelop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and Emission\nFactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis;\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct\nongoing surveys to provide accurate data\nand to integrate climate change questions\nin existing energy surveys that mainly focus\non energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng.\nEnhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh.\nEnhance technical capacity to report\non mitigation actions that are already\nimplemented or ongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress\nand the underlying steps envisaged for the\nplanned mitigation actions and when they\nwill be implemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\n5.3.2 Reported capacity-building needs in Jordan’s\nFBUR\nThe following capacity-building needs were\nreported in the FBUR (most of them are still valid)\ncovering the following areas:\nGHG inventory preparation, including:\n\nThere is a need to build capacity in the use\nof the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Software.\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 did not provide emission estimates for\nindirect GHGs such as CO, NOx, NMVOC, and\nother gases not controlled by the Montreal\nProtocol, such as SOx because the 2006 IPCC\nSoftware does not support the estimation of\nthose gases,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n110\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 have been estimated using the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines, which have structural and\nmethodological differences with the Revised\n1996 IPCC Guidelines used in estimating GHG\nemissions inventories for earlier NCs, which\nmade it difficult to provide a consistent time\nseries,\n\nIn preparing all GHG inventories so far, default\nemission factors were used since there are\nno available studies to develop national\nemission factors. The use of national emission\nfactors is highly vital, particularly for key\ncategories within the inventory.\n GHG mitigation measures, including:\n\nStakeholders had limited expertise and\nknowledge\ncapacity\nfor\nconducting\nmitigation analysis for the transportation,\nIPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors,\n\nThe complex nature of mitigation actions\nand initiatives that are being developed\nand implemented within the UNFCCC had\nbeen a challenge. The various potentials and\nfeatures of Clean Development Mechanism\n(CDM), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs), Low Emission Development\n(LED), Intended Nationally Determined\nContributions (INDCs), and other mitigation\ntools make it difficult for a holistic planning\nperspective in climate change mitigation,\n\nData quality, completeness, and accuracy\nare of a primary concern when it comes to\nestablishing the baseline and mitigation\nanalysis. Data are not up to date, nor are\nthey readily available in one place.\n5.3.3 Capacity building needs and\nrecommendations to fulfill commitments under\nthe Paris Agreement (PA)\nThe Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency\nFramework (ETF) places new and more strict\nrequirements on developing countries. To\nimplement these new requirements capacitybuilding support is vital. Article 11 of the PA\nemphasizes the importance of building the\ncapacity of developing country Parties. The\nobjective is to allow them to take effective\nclimate change actions, particularly via the\nimplementation of adaptation and mitigation\nactions, so as to facilitate “technology development,\ndissemination and deployment, access to climate\nfinance, relevant aspects of education, training and\npublic awareness and the transparent, timely and\naccurate communication of information”.\nAlso, capacity building is essential to drive climate\ntransparency. The 2015 PA outlines an “Enhanced\nTransparency Framework” including greater\nrequirements for developing countries. Some\ndeveloping countries have struggled to fulfill preParis Agreement transparency requirements and\nwill need capacity-building support to implement\nthe PA’s more stringent requirements (WRI\nWorking paper, 2019).\nThe new requirements for the PA’s enhanced\ntransparency framework have shown that\nthese requirements represent greater efforts\nto communicate on climate change action and\nsupport. Countries agreed on the guidelines\nfor the enhanced transparency framework in\nDecember 2018. However, new efforts to build\ncapacity for the transparency framework need not\n“start from scratch” but should build on and learn\nfrom the history of transparency and capacity\nbuilding under the UNFCCC.\nThe processes under the PA, including the\ntechnical expert review and the facilitative,\nmultilateral consideration of progress under\nArticle 13, the global stock take under Article 14,\nand the mechanism to facilitate implementation\nand promote compliance under Article 15 are\nexcellent capacity-building instruments since\nthey help countries improve their transparencyrelated governance systems and improve data\nand information needs for reporting. Building or\ndeveloping capacity is a process that takes time\nand requires Jordan to “learn by doing”, and by\nleveraging national experiences, lessons learned,\nand emerging tools or approaches developed over\nthe past 20 years.\nCapacity for transparency can be strengthened\nthrough enhanced governance and institutional\nstructures and supported by the right participatory\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n111\napproach. Jordan must organize institutional and\ngovernance structures able to collect, report, and\nuse data for decision-making. Governments’ ability\nto engage effectively with key stakeholders is\ncritical to obtaining data of quality and in turn\nproviding the right signals and guidance to\nconvince stakeholders to support government’s\nefforts.\nLasting systems and knowledge are critical to\nbuilding capacity. More effort is required to\nbuild the critical knowledge within key national\ninstitutions, by looking at the educational\nchannels and exploring further pedagogical\napproaches, including twinning programs, to\nproduce active national and regional peer and\nprofessional communities. National capacitybuilding centres—national universities and\ntraining centres—need to play a central role\nin the building of more durable processes for\ncollecting and managing better data, while\ncreating sustainable skills and jobs.\nJordan has already started the capacity building\nprocess by taking part in the BUR ICA (as\nmentioned\npreviously).\nAs for the implementation of Article 6 (A6) under\nthe PA, Jordan has recently started the work of\npreparing a roadmap to promote and facilitate\nJordan’s engagement in A6. A working committee\nhas been formed, aiming at raising awareness and\nbuilding the capacity of the national stakeholders.\nArticle 6 has three operative paragraphs, two\nof which relate to carbon markets: (1) Article\n6.2 provides an accounting framework for\ninternational cooperation, such as linking the\nemissions-trading schemes of two or more\ncountries. It also allows for the international\ntransfer of carbon credits between countries, (2)\nArticle 6.4 establishes a central UN mechanism to\ntrade credits from emissions reductions generated\nthrough specific projects, (3) Article 6.8 establishes\na work program for non-market approaches, such\nas applying taxes to discourage emissions.\nWhile A6 established these concepts in broad\nstrokes and countries achieved some progress\non defining the rules over the years, their final\nshape remains yet to be agreed.\n5.4 Technology Needs Assessment and\nTechnology\nTransfer\nThe Ministry of Environment, with Global\nEnvironment\nFacility\n(GEF)-UNDP\nsupport,\nhas previously published a Technology Needs\nAssessment (TNA) and technology transfer report\nfor 2004-2005. More recently, the Ministry has\ncompleted a climate change technology needs\nassessment for Jordan for the period 2015-2017,\nwhere three reports have been published by\nthis project. The first report is for the selection\nof priority mitigation and adaptation sectors\nfor TNA activities in Jordan. The second report\npresented a list of the main barriers and an\nenabling framework, while the third report,\nwhich was published in August 2017, offered a\ntechnology action plan for two priority mitigation\nsectors (energy and transport) and two priority\nadaptation sectors (water and agriculture).\nThe following TNA analysis is extracted from the\nthree published reports.\nThe top three mitigation technologies for the\nenergy sector were:\n(1) Solar thermal,\n(2) PV for electrification, and\n(3) PV for water pumping.\nThe three top-ranked priority mitigation\ntechnologies for the transportation sector were:\n(1) Bus Rapid Transit,\n(2) Improving pedestrian infrastructure, and\n(3) Ticketing systems to improve the quality and\nthe attractiveness of public transport services.\nThe final results for the water sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Roof-top rainwater harvesting,\n(2) Augmenting and expansion of Water Users\nAssociation (WUAs), and\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n112\n(3) Desalination and brackish water treatment\nand re-use.\nThe results for the agricultural sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Water saving technologies, such as drip or\nsubsurface irrigation,\n(2) Farm-level water harvesting, and\n(3) Plant varieties resistant to climate change.\nAlso recently, in April 2020, the Green Growth\nAction Plan (GGAP) was published by MoEnv,\nidentifying clearly the relation between the green\ngrowth and the climate change. The GGAP focused\non many interventions related to technology and\nknowledge transfer in the six sectors; the below\nare selected technologies that were identified:\nEnergy\n\nImprove energy demand management\nthrough development of a smart electricity\ngrid,\n\nImplement electric vehicle charging stations\nand services provision in Greater Amman\nMunicipality through a public-private\npartnership,\n\nDevelop and implement a national energy\nstorage action plan and investment pipeline,\n\nIncrease public investment in energy sector\nresearch and development,\n\nImprove the enabling environment and\ncapacity development support for the\ngrowth of the Energy Services Companies\n(ESCOs) market.\nTransport\n\nSupport the deployment of Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS) to allow a modal\nand fair integration of the public and private\ntransport systems in the city of Amman,\n\nEstablish a national centre of excellence and\ncapacity building program for sustainable\ntransport,\n\nDevelop a national electric mobility strategy\nand action plan,\n\nDesign and implement a public transport\nelectric mobility pilot and capacity building\nprogram in Amman.\nWaste\n\nEstablish a national centre for excellence on\nwaste management and circular economy\nto promote innovation, training, R&D,\ninvestment, and policy work,\n\nConduct market assessment and feasibility\nstudy to identify potential projects and\nprograms to divert organic waste from\nmunicipal solid waste streams.\nWater\n\nTechnical Assistance to support water\nefficiency in businesses, industries, and\ncommercial activities (Based on SwitchMed1\nExperience),\n\nExpand the Samra Wastewater Treatment\nPlant (Phase III),\n\nUndertake Desalination of Seawater at the\nGulf of Aqaba through Renewable Energy\nSources.\nAgriculture\n\nMap and optimize research to impact\npathways to improve relevance of innovation\nefforts in the agriculture sector,\n\nDevelop a flexible crop planning and variety\nselection methodology and decisionmaking process based on crop-per-drop\nand economic competitiveness,\n\nDesign and implement program to support\ndemonstration resource efficiency projects\nin the olive cultivation and oil production\nsector,\n\nDevelop and implement pipeline of projects\n(all sizes) and policy recommendations to\nincrease use of aquaponics and hydroponics\nin urban and rural areas,\n\nUpgrade packaging, scaling, storage and\ncooling of fruits and vegetables managed\nby the private sector,\n\nPromote the development of organic\nagriculture through knowledge exchange\nand market development.\n1.

The 14% reduction of GHG emissions\nis divided into two parts. The first part seeks\nto achieve a 1.5% reduction in GHG emissions\nthrough unilateral actions, while the remaining\n12.5% reduction is contingent and conditional\non receiving international financial support. In\nits NDCs, Jordan put the estimate of reducing\nGHG emissions by 14% at USD 5.7 billion. To\nfinance mitigation measures in the energy sector,\nJordan will require USD 5,158 million to meet its\nconditional mitigation targets.\nWhile a significant proportion of this is likely to\ncome from international sources of finance, one\nof the key sectoral actions for the energy sector\nis attracting private sector finance and reducing\nadministrative obstacles in order to enable JREEEF\nto support investments at early stages.\nIn Jordan, the role of the private sector is crucial\nand essential in achieving our NDC, the very\nhigh ratio of (Debt: GDP) makes it difficult for\nthe Government to obtain loans. Therefore, the\ngovernment is considering the role that the\nmobilization of private investment can play a role\nin implementing and achieving our NDC.\nThe key challenges in financing climate change\nprojects are summarized as follows:\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and its\nnegative effects on health, the economy\nand society, it is expected that financial\nsupport from donors will be directed to the\nhealth sector to mitigate the effects of this\npandemic, and this may negatively affect\nthe availability of the required support from\ninternational bodies or public budgets at\nthe national level to implement projects\nto protect the environment in general and\nclimate change projects in particular,\n\nLack of Climate Finance Framework (policy\nor strategy),\n\nBanks in Jordan, in general, are interested in\nproviding finance to RE and EE projects. Banks\nprefer financing RE projects, particularly\nthose which are of a larger size and linked\nto their existing client base. EE and smaller\nsized projects are less preferred,\n\nTo minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n\nThere is a lack of appropriate financial\nproducts,\n\nProject developers lack technical capacity.\nThe work of public financing institutions, such\nas JREEEF and Jordan Environment Fund (JEF),\nalthough small scale, could play a crucial role in\npromoting early stage investments, particularly\nfor public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, and\nfor Projects with co-financing. For JEF to fund\nmitigation activities will require a widening of\nits current role to include a specific focus on\nmitigation activity, and the development of\nproject selection criteria including an assessment\nof projects’ impact on GHG emissions. In addition,\nJEF currently lacks adequate human, technical, and\nfinancial capability to perform its current role, it\nneeds strengthening at various levels to have an\nexpanded role.\nJREEEF now is active and has full and adequate\ninstitutional, technical, and financial capacity to\nmanage the fund, supported by a management\ncommittee, supportive legislation (JREEEF By-\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n114\nLaw), a transparent and effective governance\nstructure, a strategic business plan, and financial\nsupport windows.\nThe majority of financial resources pumped into\nenvironmental sectors in Jordan come from donor\ncountries through bilateral agreements that focus\non fiscal and developmental challenges in the\ncountry. Framework agreements and strategies\nwith major donors like UNDP, United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID),\nUNEP, EU, GIZ, UNIDO, and other agencies have\nbeen developed and they address a variety of\nsustainable development objectives. The donor\ncommunity is supportive of a public registry of\nprojects which would allow transparency and\ncoordination of ongoing activities, as well as the\nassessment of their cost effectiveness. In addition,\nthese donors are particularly supportive of\ndeveloping strong GHG MRV frameworks, believed\nto be key to demonstrating the effectiveness of\nclimate financing (details about the current MRV\ncan be found in section 4). Financial institutions\nand banks are interested in entering this new\nsector. Several green loans and programs are\nbeing established and green suppliers and\nmanufacturers are growing in number. However,\nthe market lacks proactive marketing and public\noutreach.\nPreviously an amount of 112 million JD were\nmade available for RE and EE financing in Jordan;\n76 million JD of the total were made available\nthrough the four commercial banks using the\nCentral Bank of Jordan’s window for RE and EE,\nand 36 million JD was made available through\nthe Agence Français de Development (AFD)\nfacility. This experience was not successful, key\nchallenges in disbursing these funds included\nthe lack of credible market references and short\ncredit history. Another challenge for banks was\nthe lack of sufficient knowledge to verify project\nassumptions, technologies, or risks. They need\naccess to an independent, credible reference\nbody for the accreditation of RE and EE projects.\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps and\nneeds:\n\nExpansion of the framework for the MRV\nsystem for Received Support that addresses\nmost of the above gaps, constraints, and\nneeds by establishing a dedicated entity to\noversee collecting and verifying received\nsupport information related to climate\nchange,\n\nStrengthen the ability to develop bankable\nand evidence-based projects,\n\nIt is recommended to raise the capacities\nof stakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects,\n\nIt is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment,\n\nEnhance the partnership between the public\nand private sector.\n5.6 Financial and Technical Support Provided\nby GEF Related to Climate Change\nGEF supported Jordan financially in executing\nthe following climate change activities during\nthe period 2015-2020:\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s Third National Communication to\nthe UNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv, 20122015,\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report to the\nUNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv, 2015-2017,\n\nMainstreaming Rio Convention into National\nSectoral Polices, 2015-2018,\n\nA systematic approach to Sustainable\nUrbanization and Resource Efficiency (SURE)\nin GAM, 2018-2022,\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s Fourth National Communication\nand Second Biennial Update Report to\nthe UNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv,\n2019-present.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n115\nThe above projects have been implemented with\nUNDP support, and with technical support from\nother United Nations organizations including\nUNEP and UNFCCC. In addition, the UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Program (GSP) have provided\ntechnical support for the preparation of Jordan’s\nNational Communications and the FBUR on climate\nchange through training workshops, provision\nof guidelines and guidance materials, review of\nstudies and reports and provision of online support\nand teleconference calls.\nReferences\n\nAccess to Finance: Survey for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, USAID, 2015.\n\nBuilding Capacity for the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework: What Can We\nLearn from Countries’ Experiences and UNFCCC Processes?

Also,\nnon-Annex I Parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity building, and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nThe data on support received and financial flows\nwas requested through traditional channels by\nsending official letters and formal emails and\nfollow up calls by the Ministry of Environment to all\nrelevant entities (public and private organizations,\nUN agencies, etc.)\nImprovement was witnessed in collecting\nthe needed data due to the increased level of\nengagement of the national entities in the national\nclimate change profile over the last 2 years, and\ndue to the issuance of the Climate Change Bylaw\nin 2019, which helped to institutionalize and\nstrengthen the cooperation between relevant\nentities.\nNevertheless, there is still a need for wellestablished systems for tracking data and a\nwell-defined process for the data flow from these\norganizations into the MRV system. To date some\ndata are still present only at one entity and can’t be\ntracked from other sources (the same difficulties\nas in the First BUR of 2017).\nThe Tables below (6.1-6.7) provide information\non the support received from national, bilateral,\nand multilateral sources for the period 2015-2020\nincluding funding, technology transfer, capacity\nbuilding, and technical assistance. The data also\ndescribe the different types of support: Grant,\nOwn budget, Loans, Technical Assistant, or Private\nInvestment Corporation.\nTypes of support are defined as follows:\nClimate finance: refers to local, national or\ntransnational financing—drawn from public,\nprivate and alternative sources of financing—\nthat seeks to support mitigation and",
