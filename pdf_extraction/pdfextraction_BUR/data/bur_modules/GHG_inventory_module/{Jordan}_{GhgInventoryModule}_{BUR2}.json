NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East, and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\na variety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative areas\nor governorates. The governorates are subdivided\ninto districts and sub-districts, and within each\ngovernorate there are several municipalities.\nIn order to organise the environmental and\nclimate change institutional set up, the Ministry\nof Environment was established in 2003 to\noversee all environmental affairs. Since then,\nJordan has undergone a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. Based on the\nrecommendations of this policy, the Ministry of\nEnvironment revised the Environment Protection\nLaw, no.52 of 2006 to include and strengthen the\narticles of the law related to climate change. The\nnew Environment Protection Law no.6 of year\n2017, includes provisions on climate change goals\nwhich later enabled the Ministry to develop the\nClimate Change Bylaw no.79, 2019 which aims\nmainly to regulate the coordination of national\nefforts among relevant stakeholders to implement\nmitigation and adaptation measures.\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural\nresources, a high population growth rate, the\nongoing regional conflicts, the rising cost of health\ncare and the growing expectations of people, have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable\nsocial and economic development.\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy. The Ministry\nof Energy and Mineral Resources has recently\npublished the National Energy Sector Strategy for\n2020-2030. This ten-year plan which aims at setting\nthe roadmap to increase self-sufficiency through\nutilization of domestic natural and renewable\nresources, as well as expansion of existing energy\ndevelopments, thus reducing reliance on costly\nforeign fuel imports that burden its economy.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy identified\nrenewable energy usage alongside other sources\nas follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share,\nfollowed by household, industrial and other\nservice sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share\nrespectively.\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable water\nresources. While Jordan’s population is expected to\nincrease as a result of natural population growth,\nthe country has also experienced population\ngrowth due to the influx of multiple waves of\nrefugees putting additional strain on Jordan’s\nalready severely limited water resources.\n\n3\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot, and\ndry summers and short, cool winters. The climate\nis influenced by the country’s location between\nthe aridity of the Arabian Desert and the humidity\nof the eastern Mediterranean area. January is\nthe coldest month, with average temperatures\nranging from 5°C to 10°C, while August is the\nhottest month with average temperatures ranging\nfrom 20°C to 35°C. Rainfall varies from season to\nseason and from year to year. However, about\n75% of the country can be described as having a\ndesert climate with less than 200 millimeters of\nrain annually. About 70% of the average rainfall in\nthe country falls between November and March,\nwhile the period from June to August is often\nwithout rain. However during the last ten years,\nJordan has been witnessing variations in seasons\nand average temperatures.\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions: the Highlands and Marginal\nSteppes where most of the rain-fed farming is\npracticed, the eastern desert (the badia) and the\nlowlands (Jordan Valley).\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. The\nvast majority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, Pine and Juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners, and are found mostly in\nthe northern part of Jordan where higher rainfall\nprevails. These include natural forest vegetation\nand tree plantations on farms, in the form of\nwindbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\nTransportation infrastructure in Jordan is\nconsidered to be relatively well developed within\nthe Middle East. The estimated annual growth in\ndemand for transportation and logistics ranges\nfrom 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s transportation\nand logistics sector plays a key role in Jordan’s\neconomy and contributes over 8.2% of GDP.\nLand and air transportation infrastructure is\nwell developed, with plans to improve maritime\nand railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages. Currently,\ntransportation is considered to be very energy\ninefficient, using almost half of the final energy\nconsumption of Jordan.\nJordan experiences a relatively high growth rate\nin private cars of approximately 5% per year which\nexceeds the estimated population growth. Public\ntransport (PT) in general is not well organized and\nlacks the infrastructure and interchanges required\nfor a comfortable journey. There are few mode\nchoices for PT, compared to other countries, and\nthis has led to its low share of trips. The majority of\ntrips in Jordan are made by private car. There has\nbeen some growth in the numbers of hybrid and\nelectric cars. However, in 2018, hybrid and electric\ncars still made up less than a quarter of the private\ncars in Jordan. A low share of trips are also carried\nout using regular taxis. A new innovation is the\nuse of ride-hailing apps. Their effect on mobility\nhas yet to be studied in Jordan.\n\n4\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhas improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of municipal solid waste (MSW) over\ntime. Preliminary official estimates refer to more\nthan 20-35% increase in solid waste generation\nin Jordan following the Syrian crisis, putting a\nsubstantial burden on municipalities as well as\non the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste is collected from 100 municipalities and\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km to\nthe East of Amman over an area of 2,000 Dunums,\nenough to dispose waste until 2035. In 1989, the\nGovernment of Jordan selected Swaqa landfill,\n125 km to the South-East of Amman, as a facility\nto process hazardous waste.\n2. NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for\nthe year 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines\nand the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines. The estimation of the overall national\ninventory was carried out using the 2006 IPCC\nInventory Software for non-Annex I Parties. The\nsectors and subsectors that were considered are\nthe Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use\n(IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU) and Waste.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nin units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by source and removal by sink. Indirect\nGHGs were estimated, whenever the activity data\nwere available, using the EEA Guidelines and\nmethodology.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC SAR were used.\nThe overall GHG Inventory estimates for Jordan in\n2016 were 31,063.32 Gg of CO2-equivalent (CO2eq).\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the energy sector was\nthe major emitter releasing around 76% of total\nnational emissions followed by the waste sector\nwith a contribution of around 12%.\n Energy sector\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016. Fugitive\nemissions (from oil and natural gas) were\nnegligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with a share of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture) accounted each for 10% and 10 % of\nthe total respectively.\n\n5\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n Industrial processes and product use\n(IPPU) sector\nEmissions from the industrial processes sector\nwere 3,177.42 Gg of CO2eq accounting for\n10% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016.\nThe industrial processes sector was a source of\nNMVOCs emissions and accounted for 32.61 Gg in\n2016. In addition to CO2 and NMVOCs, the sector\ngenerated emissions of HFCs with 757.29 Gg of\nCO2eq in 2016.\n Agriculture, forestry and other land use\nchange sector\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016. The emissions were\ncomposed of methane and nitrous oxide and were\ngenerated by various subcategories.\n Waste sector\nGHG emissions from the waste sector reached\n3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for 12% of\nJordan’s total GHG emissions in 2016. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3,559.01 Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions in\n2016, while wastewater handling accounted for\n5% (188.40Gg CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\n GHG Inventory by gas\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nresulted from the energy sector accounting\nfor 95% followed by 9% from the IPPU sector.\nMethane emissions were highest from the\nwaste sector followed by the AFOLU sector with\ncontributions of 70% and 17%, respectively.\nNitrous oxide emissions were highest from the\nAFOLU sector with 57%, followed by the IPPU,\nenergy and waste sectors, with contributions of\n18%, 13% and 12%, respectively. As expected, the\nIPPU sector contributed 100% of HFCs while the\nNMVOCs emissions resulted from the IPPU and\nthe energy sectors.\nWithin the energy sector, the main emissions\nwere in the form of CO2 (97%). Within the IPPU\nsector, the key GHGs were CO2 followed by HFCs\nwith shares of 69% and 24%, respectively. Nitrous\noxide emissions were highest from the AFOLU\nsector, with around 57% mainly from fertilizers\nand manure management. Methane emissions\nwere highest from the waste sector, with 78% and\nproduced from solid waste management.\nGHG emissions (+) and removals (-) in Gg CO2eq by Gas and by Sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\nCH4\nN2O\nHFCs\nSF6\n(Gg)\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nTotal national\nemissions and\nremovals\n24,385.37\n4,675.49\n1,245.14\n757.29\n0.022\nEnergy\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\nNA\nNO\nIPPU\n2,194.88\n0.00\n225.22\n757.29\n0.022\nAFOLU\n-896.76\n614.62\n710.85\nNA, NO\nNO\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\nNA\nNO\n\n6\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n3. GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nUpdate of the FBUR baseline scenario: the\nbaseline scenario was updated for all economic\nsectors of energy, industry, agriculture and forestry\nin addition to the waste sector, based on the\nstrategies, policies and plans prevailing in the\nJordanian context during the time of preparation\nof this SBUR (2020). This requires a projection\nof the current levels to future levels for each\ntype of activity. The newly released strategies,\npolicies, action plans and committed projects\nwere reviewed and summarized. In addition,\nall projects and actions that were part of FBUR\nbaseline scenario were reviewed to update their\nstatus. Based on this review, the most probable\nfuture trends in activities that will impact and\nshape the GHG emissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n Jordan 2025, Vision and National Strategy,\nissued in May 2015.\n The new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n The\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August 2020,\n The new Solid Waste Management Framework\nLaw issued in March 2020 and entered into\nforce in September 2020,\n National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020), issued\nin 2018,\n Jordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in\n2016.\nUpdate of FBUR GHG mitigation measures: All\nmitigation projects were reviewed and assessed\nto identify all those still valid. These projects\nstill considered valid have been updated after\nadjustments were made to their expected\nimplementation timeline. The emission reduction\nand the unit cost of emission reduction for each\nmitigation project have been recalculated taking\ninto consideration several factors, such as the\nimprovement in technologies and changes in\nprices. Net present value was used in the financial\ncalculations, by converting all present and future\nrevenues and costs over the project’s lifetime to\na base of today’s cost. The same approach was\nfollowed in calculating the CO2eq emissions\nreduction over the lifetime of the mitigation\nprojects. A discount cost of 8% was used for both\nthe cost and emission reduction calculations. Also,\nthe discounted unit cost of reduced emission\nreduction was calculated as the quotient of the\ndiscounted cost in JD to the discounted emissions\nin tonnes of CO2.\nThe update of FBUR mitigation projects resulted in\n23 valid GHG mitigation projects identified within\nthe primary energy, renewable energy, energy\nefficiency, industry, domestic solid waste and\nwastewater, and agriculture and forestry sectors\nand subsectors. Emission reduction in addition\nto the abatement cost have been recalculated for\neach proposed mitigation project.\nIt was concluded from the abatement cost analysis\nfor the valid projects from the FBUR that the\nmost feasible options are the energy mitigation\nprojects. The findings indicated that in particular\nthe projects related to energy efficiency should\nreceive the most attention. The table below shows\nthe marginal abatement cost for all mitigation\nmeasures ranked from the highest to the lowest.\n\n7\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNo.\nProject Name\nEmissions Reduction\nUnit Cost (JD/tonne\nof CO2eq)\n1\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 1)\n118.68\n2\nForestry - Introduction of new plantations in Urban Areas\n40.00\n3\nRangeland 1- Restoration of Rangeland Areas\n18.00\n4\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in Northern Area\n14.50\n5\nRangeland 2- New Protected Rangeland Area as Natural Reserve\n10.00\n6\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Madaba\ndomestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.54\n7\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Baqa’a\ntertiary domestic wastewater treatment plant\n4.48\n8\nCatalytic Reduction of N2O inside the Ammonia Burner of the Nitric\nAcid Plant\n0.37\n9\nBiogas collection and utilization from Al-Dhulil domestic solid\nwaste landfill\n-0.50\n10\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge generated from Wadi\nArab domestic wastewater treatment plant\n-4.00\n11\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP 2)\n-7.18\n12\nNatural gas distribution network in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\n-13.78\n13\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw materials\nneeded to produce clinker\n-22.90\n14\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45% of Pozzolana\n-32.00\n15\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\n-32.10\n16\nUse of biomass (domestic solid waste or/and sewage sludge) as\nalternative fuels in cement plants\n-69.30\n17\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water tanks in food\nindustry\n-108.04\n18\nLoss reduction in transmission and distribution\n-108.52\n19\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional burners in the\nsteel industry\n-110.03\n20\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 houses\n-183.64\n21\nSolar water heaters 3 - 30,000 houses\n-189.95\n22\nInsulating pipes, fittings and tanks in food industries\n-215.16\n23\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices in the Jordan valley\n-1333.00\nMarginal abatement cost for all mitigation measures (ranked from the highest to the lowest)\n\n8\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n4. DOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING,\nAND VERIFICATION\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its market readiness proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\nProposal (PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined\na plan for implementing the market readiness\ncomponents that will be necessary to support\nthe development of appropriate market based\ninstruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n A National MRV system and registry for climate\nmitigation measures,\n Designing a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n Exploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith the development of a multi-tiered integrated\nMRV system. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE). Adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors will serve in tracking progress\ntowards NDC commitments.\n5. UPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND\nRELATED NEEDS\nThe following are some recommendations for\nthe successful implementation of the climate\nchange bylaw no 79/2019, through support of\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to this bylaw:\n It is recommended that the MoEnv as chair\nof the NCCC clarify and continually stress the\nrole of different ministries and institutions in\nthe area of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n Seek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe, committee and the technical groups,\nformed according to the climate change bylaw,\nin areas relevant to their roles,\n It is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at least\n3 years) to be able to strengthen their work\nand it’s highly recommended to prepare their\nsuccessors in advance,\n Climate change directorates at different\nministries and institutions are important\nvehicles to mainstream climate change into\nthe strategies and policies of their respective\ninstitutions. As such, it is recommended that\nthe MoEnv coordinates continuously with these\ndepartments and supports them in identifying\ntheir capacity building needs.\nJordan’s FBUR to the UNFCCC was prepared and\nsubmitted in late 2017. After its submission, a\nTeam of Technical Experts (TTE) was tasked with\nits review. These experts were trained to conduct\nreviews as part of the ICA according to Decision\n2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s FBUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify the capacity-building\nneeds of developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NC’s:\n\n9\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series,\nb. Develop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources,\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis,\nd. Develop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and emission\nfactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis,\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct ongoing\nsurveys to provide accurate data and to\nintegrate climate change questions in existing\nenergy surveys that mainly focus on energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng. Enhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh. Enhance technical capacity to report on mitigation\nactions that are already implemented or\nongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress and the\nunderlying steps envisaged for the planned\nmitigation actions and when they will be\nimplemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\nIn terms of financial resources needs; the key\nchallenges in financing climate change projects\nare summarized as follows:\n Due to the Corona pandemic and its negative\neffects on health, the economy and society, it\nis expected that financial support from donors\nwill be directed to the health sector to mitigate\nthe effects of this pandemic, and this may\nnegatively affect the availability of the required\nsupport from international bodies or public\nbudgets at the national level to implement\nprojects to protect the environment in general\nand climate change projects in particular,\n Lack of climate finance framework (policy or\nstrategy),\n Banks in Jordan, in general, are interested\nin providing finance to renewable energy\nand energy efficiency projects. Banks prefer\nfinancing RE projects, particularly those which\nare of a larger size and linked to their existing\nclient base. EE and smaller sized projects are\nless preferred,\n To minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n There is a lack of appropriate financial products,\n Project developers lack technical capacity.\n\n10\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps and\nneeds:\n Expansion of the framework for the MRV system\nfor received support that addresses most of\nthe above gaps, constraints, and needs by\nestablishing a dedicated entity to oversee\ncollecting and verifying received support\ninformation related to climate change,\n Strengthen the ability to develop bankable and\nevidence-based projects,\n It is recommended to raise the capacities of\nstakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects,\n It is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment,\n Enhance the partnership between the public\nand private sector.\n \n\n11\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRoman Theater\n\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1\n1.1\nLocation and Climate\n14\n1.2\nGovernance Structure\n15\n1.3\nThe Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n15\n1.4\nSocial Indicators\n16\n1.5\nEconomic Context\n18\n1.6\nEnergy Profile\n19\n1.7\nWater Resources\n22\n1.8\nAgriculture and Forestry\n25\n1.9\nTransportation\n26\n1.10 Industry\n31\n1.11 Waste Management\n31\nReferences\n33\n\n14\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThis\nchapter\ndescribes\nJordan’s\nnational\ncircumstances that are related directly and\nindirectly to climate change.\nThe following sections will be covered:\n Location and Climate\n Governance Structure\n The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\n Social Indicators\n Economical Context\n Energy Profile\n Water Resources\n Agriculture and Forestry\n Transportation\n Industry\n Waste Management\n1.1 Location and Climate\nJordan is a relatively small country situated at\nthe heart of the Middle East and occupying an\narea of approximately 89,318 square kilometers.\nDespite the relatively small area, Jordan has a\ndiverse terrain and landscape demonstrating\nvariety usually found only in large countries.\nJordan’s climate is characterized by long, hot,\nand dry summers and short, cool winters. The\nclimate is influenced by the country’s location\nbetween the aridity of the Arabian Desert and\nthe humidity of the eastern Mediterranean area.\nJanuary is the coldest month, with average\ntemperatures ranging from 5°C to 10°C, while\nAugust is the hottest month with average\ntemperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C.  Rainfall\nvaries from season to season and from year to\nyear. However, about 75% of the country can be\ndescribed as having a desert climate with less than\n200 millimeters of rain annually. About 70% of\nthe average rainfall in the country falls between\nNovember and March, while June through August\nare often rainless. However during the last ten\nyears, Jordan has been witnessing changes in\nseasons and average temperatures.\nJordan can be divided into three main geographic\nand climatic areas: the Jordan Valley, the Mountain\nHeights Plateau, and the Eastern Desert, or Badia\nregion. The Jordan Valley has the country’s most\ndistinctive natural terrain. The northern segment\nof the Jordan Valley, known in Arabic as the\nGhor, is the most fertile region. Several degrees\nwarmer than the rest of the country, its year-round\nagricultural climate, fertile soils, higher winter\nrainfall, and extensive summer irrigation have\nmade the Ghor the food basket of Jordan. The\nJordan Valley is the location of the Jordan River\nwhich extends from the northern border down\nto the Dead Sea.\nThe Mountain Heights Plateau is the highlands\nof Jordan. It extends through the entire length\nof the western part of the country and separates\nthe Jordan Valley and its margins from the plains\nof the eastern desert. These areas receive Jordan’s\nhighest rainfall, and are the most richly vegetated\nin the country. This region hosts most of Jordan’s\npopulation centres, including the cities of Amman,\nMadaba, Zarqa, Irbid, and Karak.\nThe Eastern Desert or Badia Region comprises\naround 75% of Jordan. This area of desert and\ndesert steppe is part of what is known as the\nNorth Arab Desert. It stretches into Syria, Iraq, and\nSaudi Arabia, with elevations varying between 600\nand 900 meters above sea level. Climate in the\nBadia varies widely between day and night, and\nbetween summer and winter. Daytime summer\ntemperatures can exceed 40°C, while winter\nnights can be very cold, dry, and windy. Rainfall is\nminimal throughout the year, averaging less than\n50 millimeters annually. Although the regions of\nthe Badia (or desert) have common harsh desert\nclimate, similar vegetation, and sparse population\nconcentrations, those regions vary considerably\naccording to their geology.\n\n15\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.2 Governance Structure\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a\nconstitutional monarchy with a representative\ngovernment. Jordan is divided into twelve\nadministrative areas or Governorates (Figure\n1.1). Each Governorate is managed by a Governor\nwho is designated by the Cabinet based on the\nrecommendation of the Minister of Interior.\nFigure 1.1: The twelve governorates of Jordan.\nThe Governorates are subdivided into districts, subdistricts, and chief towns and these are managed by\ncivil servants of the Ministry of Interior, whose task\nis to coordinate and supervise the decentralized\nservices of other ministries under the authority\nof the Governor. Within governorates there are\nseveral municipalities, the Law of 1955 defines the\nMunicipality as being “A financially independent\nnational institution”, having a “legal personality”\nand an administrative autonomy, which is managed\nby the town council that is composed of the Mayor\nand 6 to 11 councilors.\n1.3 The Environmental and Climate Change\nInstitutional Set Up\nThe Ministry of Environment was established\nin 2003 to oversee all environmental affairs.\nSince then the country has witnessed a steady\nexpansion of the legal and institutional framework\nfor environmental protection. The Ministry of\nEnvironment became the focal point for all\ninternational environmental conventions including\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC).\nJordan is undergoing a rapid and effective\nprocess of enhancing its relevant institutional and\npolicy framework for addressing climate change\nchallenges. In August 2014, the Directorate of\nClimate Change was established within the\nMinistry of Environment. The Directorate acts as\nthe institutional hub for coordinating all climate\nchange activities in Jordan in relation to the\nUNFCCC. The National Climate Change Policy\n(2013-2020) was issued by identifying the national\npriorities for adaptation to climate change and\nmitigation of greenhouse emissions. The policy\nprovides guidance to sector strategies from a\n\n16\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTable 1.1: Social indicators\nclimate change perspective, and it provides a\nframework for coordination of climate change\nactivities at the national level.\nBased on the recommendations of this policy, the\nMinistry of Environment revised the Environment\nProtection Law, no.52 of 2006 to add new articles\nrelated to climate change and strengthen the\nexisting articles. The new Environment Protection\nLaw no.6 of year 2017, includes provisions on\nclimate change goals which later enabled the\nministry to develop the climate change bylaw\nno.79, 2019.\nThe climate change bylaw aims to regulate;\n(a) the coordination of national efforts among\nrelevant stakeholders to implement mitigation\nand adaptation measures, (b) the development\nof a legislative framework that maps out plans to\ncombat climate change in the Kingdom and ways\nto implement them, (c) the streaming of climate\nchange into national plans and the implementation\nof the goals and principles of the UNFCCC and the\nParis Agreement. According to the bylaw, a highlevel committee is established under the name\n“National Committee on Climate Change” which\nis chaired by the Minister of Environment and\nconsists of 16 high-level members from relevant\npublic authorities. Its functions and powers are\nidentified within the bylaw including the power\nto form technical teams from governmental and\nnon-governmental agencies represented by\ncivil society institutions, research institutions,\nuniversities and the private sector institutions.\nThe teams are mainly tasked with supporting the\nMoEnv with the NDC, the national adaptation plan\nand any other reports that should be prepared\nwithin Jordan’s international commitments and\nassessing the capacity-building needs of relevant\nentities related to climate change and contributing\nto the implementation of awareness-raising and\ncapacity-building activities.\n1.4 Social Indicators\nThe following table summarizes the main\nsocial indicators in Jordan; including the main\ndemographic data for the Jordanian population,\nrefugees and education and health indicators.\nPopulation (end of year 2019)\n10,554,000\nMale\n5,588,000\nFemale\n4,966,000\nUrban ( 90.3% )\n9,529.200\nRural ( 9.7% )\n1,024,800\nAge less than 14 years\n34.4 %\nAge between (20-45) years\n39 %\nPopulation Growth Rate\nFor years (1952- 1979)\n4.8%\nFor years (1994-2004)\n2.6%\nFor years (2004-2015)\n5.3%\n\n17\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe average household income (DOS, 2017 and 2018)\n11,242 JD\nAverage annual income for female-headed households\n9,534 JD\nAverage annual income for male-headed households\n11,519 JD\nThe gender pay gap\n17%\nThe female participation in the Jordanian labor market (World Bank,\n2020)\n15%\nHouseholds Headed by Female (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (agricultural land)\n44%\nOwn livestock\n30%\nHouseholds Headed by Male (IFAD, 2015)\nOwn farms (Agricultural land)\n68%\nOwn livestock\n36%\nRefugees (registered as refugees) to End of Year 2019\n755,050\nRoughly Annual Cost providing for refugees (JRP, 2018)\n2.9 Billion JD = 8% of GDP\nParticipation from International Community (%) (JRP, 2018)\n5.5%\nSyrian refugees (UNHCR,2019)\n664,226\nIn urban areas\n80%\nIn (Al Za,Atari, Mrajeeb Al-farhood, Cyper City and Al-Azraq ) Camps\n20%\nEducation in Jordan (DOS,2017)\nIlliteracy rate for those above 15 years old (DOS,2017)\n5.1%\nExpenditures on education (% of GDP)\n3.6%\nHealth Indicators\nTotal annual expenditure per capita (WHO,2014)\n798 USD\nExpenditures (% of GDP) (WHO,2014)\n7.5%\nLife expectancy (DOS,2017)\n73.5\nInfant mortality rate per 1000 capita (UN, 2019)\n14\nCrude birth rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n21.5\nCrude death rate per 1000 (UN, 2019)\n3.9\nSource: DOS, 2019 unless otherwise indicated\n\n18\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe national accounts statistics published in 2019\nby the Central Bank of Jordan and the Department\nof Statistics (DOS) showed that there was an\nimprovement in GDP per capita at existing prices\nin 2018 while the GDP growth rate decreased.\nTable 1.3 shows the national statistics and the\npercentage of the main contributing sectors to\nGDP along the last five years (2014-2018).\n1.5 Economic Context\nThe Jordanian economy is one of the smallest\neconomies in the region. A lack of natural resources,\na high population growth rate, the ongoing\nregional conflicts, the rising cost of health care,\nand the growing expectations of people have\nposed challenges to the country’s sustainable social\nand economic development.

The sharp\ndrop in foreign grants from 700 million JD in 2018\ncompared to 1,236.5 million JD in 2014, came as a\nshock, as Jordan depends heavily on foreign grants\nto finance its capital expenditure. The consolidated\nbudget deficit for the central government and\ngovernment owned units reached 694.8 million\nJD in 2017, compared to 825.9 million JD within\nthe same period of 2016.\nOutstanding external public debt (government\nand government guaranteed) decreased by\n2.6% to reach 11,560 million JD at the end of the\nsecond quarter of the year 2018, which represents\na decrease in the percentage to GDP from 41.7% at\nthe end of 2017 to 39.8% by the end of the second\nquarter of 2018. (MOF, 2018).\nIn contrast, net domestic debt balance increased\nby 10.6% reaching 15,005 million JD in the same\nperiod, net domestic debt as percent of GDP was\n51.6 % by the end of the second quarter of 2018\ncompared to 47.7% of GDP at the end of 2017.\nThe increase of net domestic debt was a result of\nincreasing net outstanding budgetary debt by\n1,359 million JD and increasing net outstanding\ndebt of NEPCO and WAJ by 77 million JD.\n\nThe net outstanding public debt increased by 4.4%\nfrom its level at the end of 2017, reaching about\n26,564 million JD, and representing 91.4% of the\nestimated GDP for 2018.\n1.6 Energy Profile\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy, comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP\nand placing a strain on its economy (MEMR, 2019).\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\n\n20\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe Strategy, which assumes 2018 as base year, predicts the changes in contribution of different energy\nsources in electricity generation between 2020 and 2030 as illustrated in the following charts.\nFigure 1.2: The National Energy Strategy (2020-2030) forecast for electricity generation\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the nationally\ndetermined contributions (NDCs) target by 2030.\nThe total renewable capacity by the end of 2018\nwas 1,130 MW and expected to reach 2,400 MW\nby the end of 2020, accounting for 20% of the\ngenerated electricity, compared to 1% in 2014\n(MEMR, 2018).\nIn 2014, a legislative and regulatory framework for\nrenewable energy has been set up by enacting a\nspecial renewable energy law as well as developing\nthe needed bylaws and instructions, which promote\nrenewable energy through financial incentives. As\na result, many renewable energy power purchase\nagreements were signed to supply the grid with\nelectricity generated from solar and wind. Many of\nthese projects became operational in 2015.\nThe largest energy consumer in 2018 was the\ntransport sector with a 49% percent share followed\nby household, industrial and other services sectors\nwith 21.5%, 15.5% and 14% share respectively.\nFigure (1.3) shows the final energy consumption\nin Jordan by sector for the year 2018.\n\n21\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe interruption of the Egyptian gas supply forced\nthe Jordanian government to look for new sources\nof natural gas. The construction of a Liquefied\nNatural Gas (LNG) jetty project at Aqaba port,\nthe connection to the Arab gas pipeline, and the\nleasing of a Floating Storage and Regasification\nUnit (FSRU) were successfully implemented and\nput into commercial operation in September\n2015. In 2018, 88.8% of electricity generated in\nthe Kingdom was based on imported natural\ngas. Eventually, Jordan will develop the ability to\nmeet all its needs for natural gas: for electricity\ngeneration and for industrial use.\nJordan possesses one of the largest oil shale\nreserves in\nthe\nworld with total\ndeposits\nestimated at 70 billion tonnes, containing more\nthan seven billion tonnes of oils. It is planned\nthat by 2020, 470 MW of electric generating\ncapacity will be under operation from the Attarat\nOil shale project signed in 2014 (MEMR, 2018).\nThe Attarat Power Plant is an oil shale-fueled\npower plant under construction in the Attarat\nUm Ghudran area, 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of\nAl Qatranah in Jordan.\nThis project is being developed by the Attarat\nPower Company (APCO) (which is a partnership\nbetween YTL Power International (45%), Guangdong\nYudean Group (45%) and Eesti Energia (%10)),\nto be the first oil shale fired power station and\nopen cast mine to commercially utilize Jordan’s oil\nshale. APCO has entered into a -30 year agreement\nwith NEPCO for the sale of the entire electrical\ncapacity and net electrical output following\nconstruction of the power station. The power\nplant will have 554 MW gross and 477 MW net\ncapacity and it will consist of two circulatingfluidized-bed units. It is expected to meet 10-15%\nof Jordan´s annual power demand. \nAdditionally, Jordan has developed a strategy for\nutilizing nuclear power to supply the country with\n30% of its demand for electricity by 2030, with\nsurplus destined for export. A nuclear power\ncommittee was set up in 2007 and a law was\nenacted to establish the Jordan Atomic Energy\nCommission (JAEC) and the Jordan Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (JNRC). In December\n2016, JAEC in cooperation with a consortium\nheaded by the Korean Atomic Energy Research\nFigure 1.3: Energy consumption per sector, 2018\n\n* Others: Commercial and agricultural sectors along with streetlight. Source: MEMR, 2019\n*\n\n22\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nInstitute inaugurated the 5 MW Jordan Research\nand Training Reactor. The facility is the first nuclear\nreactor in the county. It will provide radioactive\nisotopes for medical applications in Jordan, and\nwill provide training for students at the Jordan\nUniversity of Science and Technology to prepare\na skilled workforce for the country’s planned\ncommercial nuclear power reactors.\nThe country was aiming to have two 1,000 MW\nnuclear power units in operation by 2025, by the\nRosatom Company, but is now considering the use\nof small modular reactors (SMRs) instead which\nseems to be the more appropriate in bridging the\ngap in the Jordanian electricity generation mix.\n1.7 Water Resources\nJordan is ranked as the second poorest country\nin the world in terms of water resources, with\nless than 100 m3/capita/year of renewable\nwater resources (MWI, 2017). While Jordan’s\npopulation is expected to increase as a result of\nnatural population growth, the country has also\nexperienced population growth due to the influx\nof multiple waves of refugees putting additional\nstrain on Jordan’s already severely limited water\nresources.\nWater use in Jordan is distributed among three\ndifferent sectors: agriculture, municipal supplies,\nand industry. In 2017, the agriculture sector was\nthe largest user of the country’s water resources,\naccounting for 52% of the total water supply, while\n45% was used for Municipal supplies, and 3% for\nindustrial uses, as indicated by Figure 1.4.\nAccording to 2017 figures, about 46% of the\nagricultural demand is met by groundwater\nresources and the rest is met by surface and\ntreated water, as shown in Table 1.4 (MWI, 2017).\nThe majority of irrigated land in Jordan is located\nFigure 1.4: Water use by sector, 2017\n\n23\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nin the highlands and desert areas (about 52,700\nhectares), and in the Jordan Valley (about 31,600\nhectares).\nAbout 72% of the water supply for domestic uses\nis met by groundwater sources. The potable water\ninfrastructure in Jordan is not very efficient. The\nwater loss was estimated as 48% in 2017 compared\nto 43% in 2010, divided into more than 50% as\nadministrative loss and less than 50% as physical\nloss from the networks. (MWI, 2017)\nAbout 85% of the industrial demand is met by\ngroundwater resources. It is worth noting that\nindustrial water demand is projected to increase,\ndue to anticipated expansion in industrial\nenterprises as a result of Jordan’s inclusion in the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), the free trade\nagreements signed between Jordan and the\nUnited States, and the establishment of free zones\nin different regions of Jordan. These agreements\nmake Jordan a desirable destination for regional\ninvestors and manufacturers.\nWater Source\nSector\nTotal\n (MCM)\nPercentage\nof the total\nDomestic\nIndustrial\nAgriculture\nGroundwater\n338.4\n27.2\n253.2\n618.8\n59 %\nSurface water\n131.3\n2.4\n154.4\n288.1\n27 %\nTreated Wastewater\n0\n2.5\n144.2\n146.7\n14 %\nTotal\n469.7\n32.1\n551.8\n1,053.6\n100 %\nPercentage of the total\n45%\n3%\n52%\n100%\nSource: MWI, 2017\nTable 1.4: Water sources for different sectors\nGroundwater contributes about 59% to the total\nwater supply. Of the twelve major groundwater\nbasins, ten are over-extracted. Increasing overall\nwater extraction to meet national needs carries a\nhigh cost. Jordan is now accessing nonrenewable\nwater resources from fossilized deep-water\naquifers. Underground water from the nonrenewable Disi aquifer (about 100 MCM) is being\nused to meet Jordan’s water supply for domestic\nuse, while treated wastewater (147 MCM) is being\nused mostly to meet the country’s agricultural\nneeds (MWI, 2017). Surface water supplies account\nfor 27% of Jordan’s total water supply estimated\nas 288.1 MCM in 2017.\nJordan’s population was 10.3 million in 2018\nand it is expected to reach 19 million by 2050\nunder business-as-usual scenario (DOS, 2018). The\nproportion of water used for domestic purposes\nmay increase by 50-60% in the same time period.\nBy 2025, water demand will exceed available water\nresources by more than 26%, but this deficit is\nprojected to decline to 6% when the Red SeaDead Sea project is put into operation (MWI, 2016).\nWater shortage in Jordan is a chronic problem and\nwill continue to be so for years to come. If current\ndomestic, agricultural, and industrial water-use\npractices are not improved, the water supply in\nJordan will deplete in quantity and quality over\ntime. Overdraft of groundwater and surface water\nis creating a tremendous stress on the water\nsupply in Jordan. The reduced flow of surface\nwater to the Dead Sea is also a source of concern.\nDespite Jordan’s severe water scarcity, more\nthan 94% of Jordanians have access to safe\ndrinking water and 65% have access to improved\nsanitation. These are some of the highest rates\nin the Middle East and North Africa region.\nHowever, water supply is intermittent, and the\nrooftop tanks have become an integral part of\nthe supply water storage system. Around 50% of\nJordanians are supplied by water once a week\n(24 hours) while the rest are supplied by a higher\nrate (more than 24 hours per week) (MWI, 2017).\nSince the Disi-Amman Conveyor Project became\n\n24\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\noperational in the summer of 2013, the continuity\nof water supply to Amman has improved. However,\npopulation centres in the northern governorates\nhave not benefitted fully because of increased\ndemand driven by the concentration of Syrian\nrefugees in the north. Aqaba has continuous\nwater supply from the Disi Aquifer. It is planned\nto bridge the remaining gap between demand and\nsupply through increased use of non-conventional\nwater including reclaimed water and desalinated\nseawater to be provided by the Red Sea-Dead\nSea project in the near future. The National Water\nStrategy emphasizes desalination as well as treated\nwastewater reuse to meet shortfalls in freshwater\navailability (MWI, 2017).\nThe Jordan National Water Strategy 2016-2025 has\nidentified treated wastewater, when mixed with\nsurface water, as a source of irrigation water. In\n2017, the amount of treated wastewater exceeded\n163 MCM. There are 33 public working wastewater\ntreatment plants in Jordan, most of which use\nactivated sludge. They are either operated by the\nWater Authority of Jordan (WAJ) or managed by\nthe Project Management Unit (PMU) at the Ministry\nof Water and Irrigation (MWI) through contracts\nwith the private sector. The Samra Wastewater\nTreatment Plant (WWTP) receives more than 70%\nof the country’s total generated wastewater.\nAccording to MWI figures, the ratio of industrial\nto total water use in 2017 was very small (5.2%).\nIndustrial wastewater discharged to wadis and\nother surface water bodies was first regulated by\nMartial Law issued in 1981, to force all industries\nto treat their wastewater before discharge to\nreceiving water bodies. A number of industrial\nentities divert their wastewater to the public sewer\nsystem according to WAJ regulation No. 18/1998.\n\n25\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n1.8 Agriculture and Forestry\nJordanian agriculture is established along three\nmajor climatic regions with various landscape\nclassification (Figure 1.5) among which: the\nhighlands and marginal steppes where most of\nthe rain-fed farming is practiced, the Badia (deserts\nand rangeland; mostly livestock systems and\nsome cultivation in watersheds and from deep\nbore irrigation), and the lowlands (Jordan Valley)\nthat thinly stretches from the North West to the\nSouth West.\nFigure 1.5: Preliminary Landscape classification (Created by Natalia BOULAD, 2019)\n\n26\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe importance of the agricultural sector stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source of\nfood, in particular fruits and vegetables, but it is\nalso a source of hard currency from exports. In\naddition, the agro-industrial sector is characterized\nby a large number of small enterprises. The vast\nmajority of irrigated agricultural production\ntargets fruit trees and vegetables. More than 90%\nof irrigated areas in Jordan are dedicated to the\ncultivation of fruit trees and vegetables.\nTable 1.5: Indicators of agricultural sector\nSocio-economic Indicators for Agriculture in Jordan\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n20%\nThe contribution of Agriculture to GDP in 2018 (Central Bank of Jordan, 2018)\n6.1%\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n57 Million JD\nThe value of contribution to GDP in 1974 (Central Bank of Jordan Periodic\nReports, 2018)\n1,687.9 Million\nJD\n% of active employees\n1.7%\nNon-Jordanian workers holding work permits in Agriculture in 2017 (DOS,2017)\n81,691\nNumber of Males\n79,685\nNumber of Females\n2006\nAgricultural product exports are a significant\ncontributor to Jordan’s overall export profile;\nstrong productivity and competitiveness of the\nsector are clearly shown despite its relatively\nsmall contribution of 6.1% to the country’s GDP.\nThe Jordanian agriculture exports represented\napproximately 18% of Jordan’s exports (or US$ 6.2\nbillion) in 2016. Exporting agricultural produce has\nbeen affected by the conflict in Syria, causing a\nsevere decline of around 25% as well as disrupting\noverland exports to other markets (Oxford Business\nGroup, 2015).\nAgriculture is mostly influenced by water\navailability and the ability to use advanced\npractices, technologies, and interventions to adapt\nto the impacts of climate change. Over the past two\ndecades, Jordan has witnessed a drastic drop in\nrainfall and prolonged drought periods. According\nto Jordan’s Third National Communication (TNC)\nreport outcomes, it is projected to witness a\ndecrease in precipitation by 15-60% and a rise\nof 1-4°C in temperatures. These climatic changes\nwill have serious negative consequences on\nnatural ecosystems, river basins, watersheds, and\nbiodiversity.\nThe forest vegetation in Jordan can be divided into\nnatural forests that are composed of evergreen\nshrubs, pine and juniper forests as well as broadleaf\nforests. Private forests are registered in the name\nof their private owners and are found mostly\nin the northern part of Jordan where higher\nrainfall is prevailing. They include natural forest\nvegetation and tree plantations on farms, in the\nform of windbreaks and shelter-belts. Private forests\naccount for less than 4 % of the total declared\nforestland.\n1.9 Transportation\nTransportation is a key sector for Jordan, providing\na necessary service to promote economic growth.\nCurrently it is considered to be very energy\ninefficient (ACT Alliance repot, 2018), using\nalmost half of the final energy consumption of\nJordan (MEMR Brochure, 2019). The estimated\nannual growth in demand for transportation and\nlogistics ranges from 5% to 6% until 2030. Jordan’s\n\n27\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\ntransportation and logistics sector plays a key role\nin Jordan’s economy and contributes over 8.2% of\nGDP. (Jordan Investment Commission, 2017). Land,\nmaritime and air transportation infrastructure\nare well developed, and there are plans to\ndevelop railway infrastructure. The Government\nof Jordan has developed a national transport\nstrategy to upgrade the country’s infrastructure\nand enable the Kingdom to capitalize on its\nstrategic geographical advantages.\nToday, there is an extensive 80,000 square kilometers\nroad network which spans across the Kingdom,\nconnecting it with neighboring countries.\nThere is no regular passenger rail in the country.\nThe Hejaz railway which runs the length of the\ncountry from north to south, has not been used for\nmany years and would need extensive renovation,\nto be put back into operation. The service from\nAmman to Syria was halted about 10 years ago,\nand the only passenger railway trips are for ondemand tourist trips travelling from Amman to\nJiza, a short distance to the south of the city.\nThe Kingdom serves as an important regional\ntransport\nhub between\nGulf\nCooperation\nCouncil (GCC) countries and Turkey and Europe,\nand also between Iraq and the Red Sea and\nthe Mediterranean. \nThere are three airports in Jordan: Queen Alia\nInternational Airport (QAIA), the main airport, and\nAmman Civil Airport, both in Amman Governorate\nand King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nThe only scheduled internal flights are passenger\nflights between QAIA and Aqaba.\nThe port city of Aqaba, on the Red Sea, provides\nthe only gateway to shipping for the country and\nis therefore an important centre for freight.\nAdditionally, the transport sector in the inventories\nof 2012 and 2016 was estimated to have\ncontributed to 26% and 28% respectively of the\ngreenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest\nemitter after the energy industries (electricity\ngeneration). The available national inventories,\nshow that the share of emissions for the transport\nsector are rising at an increasing rate, and that\nthe share of emissions within the inventories are\nrising, see table below.\nYear\n2006\n2010\n2012\n2016\nTransport Emissions Gg/CO2\n4,706\n5,297\n7,392\n8,787\n% of National GHG Emissions\n16\n23\n26\n28\nSource: TNC and BURs.\nTable 1.6: Transport GHG emissions from national inventories\nThe majority of trips in Jordan are made by private\ncars as indicated in the modal split in table 1.7. The\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) estimated this to be\n35% of trips for 2010, based on household surveys\nand this was backed up by the household survey\ncarried out in Amman in 2008, which estimated that\n33% of trips were made by private car. It is expected\nthat these percentages will have increased since\nthese surveys were carried out.

(GAM,\n2010)\nThere has been some growth in the numbers of\nhybrid and electric cars. However, their popularity\nis strongly dependent on government policy,\nwhich until now has not been consistent. In 2018,\nhybrid and electric cars still made up less than a\nquarter of the private cars in Jordan, as shown in\nthe table below.\n \nGasoline\nHybrid\nElectric\nTotal\nNo of Vehicles\n892,875\n244,080\n16,017\n1,153,271\n% of Vehicles\n77.4\n21.2\n1.4\n100\nSource: DOS, 2014-2018\nPublic transport (PT) in general is not well organized\nand lacks the infrastructure and interchanges\nrequired for a comfortable journey. There are few\nmode choices for PT, compared to other countries,\nthe available modes being: large bus, minibus and\nshared taxis (running on fixed routes). There is also\na lack of accessibility – with the coverage of PT\nservices in Jordan below the international average.\nIn general PT is considered suitable only for those\nwith no other option and this has led to its low\nshare of trips.\nThere is even lower share of trips carried out\nusing regular taxis, although these are not\ngenerally available outside of main centres. A\nnew innovation is the use of ride-hailing apps and\nseveral companies notably Uber and Careem, have\nbecome very popular after initial licensing issues\nwere resolved.\nAs a consequence of the introduction of ridehailing apps, a law was issued in 2017, which\nprohibits anyone from providing services relating\nto the transportation of passengers without\nTable 1.8: Number of private cars by fuel type in 2018\nA law has been passed that any new gas station,\nmust also provide electric charging points.\nHowever, until now, charging stations have not\nbeen provided in sufficient numbers to encourage\nthe uptake of electric vehicles. Currently there are\nonly around 50 charging stations for the whole\ncountry, and an agreement signed with German\nCompany e-Charge in 2018 to provide 10,000\nElectric vehicles (EV) charging stations has not yet\nbeen implemented. (Electromaps, 2020)\nThe uptake of electric cars has been slow and they\ncurrently make up only 1% of the private cars in\nJordan. As can be seen in the table below most\nof these are in Amman, although the numbers\nincreased sharply in 2019 in Zarqa and Irbid.\nTable 1.9: Electric cars registered in Amman and in Jordan\n\n29\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nbeing registered and licensed with the Land\nTransport Regulatory Commission (LTRC). Within\nthis framework, two regulations were issued in\n2018, which allowed for the complete licensing\nand registration of companies using ride-hailing\napplications: the Regulation concerning the\nTransportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications and the Instructions Regulating\nthe Transportation of Passengers through Smart\nApplications.\nThere are currently about 12,500 vehicles in Jordan\nlicensed for use with ride hailing apps. Their effect\non mobility has not yet been studied in Jordan, so\nit is not clear whether trips are shifting from regular\ntaxi, public transport or private car or whether they\nare enabling “untapped demand”, trips that would\nnot otherwise be made.\nUber and Careem cars have the advantage of not\ntaking up space for parking. In fact difficulty of\nfinding parking is one reason why people may\nchoose to use their services. Additionally, since\nthey do not circulate looking for rides, there are\nexpected to be reductions in congestion, fuel\nconsumption and emissions, compared to regular\ntaxis.\nConcerning freight, the current modes used for\ntransport for imports and exports are by truck,\nplane, ship and pipeline. Truck is the most versatile,\nwith the most clearance points. Air freight is\ntransported through the three airports in Amman\nand Aqaba and shipping freight is transported\nthough Aqaba Port. Pipelines are used for import\nof natural gas through Aqaba.\nThe table 1.10 below shows the amount of\ntransported freight by weight, by mode and year.\nThere are no clear trends in the data.\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n8,840\n7,357\n6,977\n7,250\n8,564\nPlanes\n67\n76\n79\n83\n73\nShip\n21,075\n21,316\n23,361\n22,506\n20,998\nPipeline\n229\n234\n0\n0\n419\nTotal\n30,212\n28,982\n30,417\n29,839\n30,054\nIn the table below the percentage, by weight,\ntransported by each mode are compared. It can\nbe seen that the most important mode for freight\ntransport is ship, although this has been decreasing\nover the last few years. The second most important\nmode is truck, which has shown a corresponding\nincrease over the last few years. The share of freight,\nby weight, transported by plane and by pipeline,\nis minimal.\nTable 1.10: Freight transported by mode (gross weight in 1000 tonnes)\nTable 1.11: Freight transported by mode in %\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\nTrucks\n29\n25\n23\n24\n28\nPlanes\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nShip\n70\n74\n77\n75\n70\nPipeline\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\nTotal\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n\n30\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nGovernance and Structure of the Transportation\nSector\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No.89, 2003. MoT is responsible\nfor developing the transport general policies and\nstrategies and supervising their implementation in\ncoordination and collaboration with the relevant\nentities. It is also responsible for regulating and\nmonitoring both public and freight transport. MoT\ncedes its responsibilities concerning planning and\nimplementation of transport to two organizations\nin different areas of Jordan. These are Greater\nAmman Municipality (GAM) and Aqaba Special\nEconomic Zone Authority (ASEZA).\nMinistry of Transport carries out its responsibilities\nin coordination with the related Government\norganizations described below:\n Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission (CARC)\nwas established in 2007 to replace the Civil\nAviation Authority (CAA) in accordance with\narticle 68 of the civil aviation law number 41\nof 2007. The function of CARC is to regulate\nall affairs pertaining to civil aviation including\nsafety, security, economic and environmental\naspects,\n The Transport Regulatory Commission- In July\n2020 the cabinet agreed to combine three\ntransport organizations into the Transport\nRegulatory\nCommission.\nThese\nformer\norganizations are: Land Transport Regulatory\nCommission (LTRC), the Jordan Maritime\nCommission (JMC) and the Jordan-Hejaz Railway\nCorporation,\n The Land Transport Regulatory Commission was\nestablished in 2010 to take over from the former\nPublic Transport Regulatory Commission (PTRC),\nbut with additional responsibility for freight\ntransport, by road. Its function is to regulate\nand monitor land transport and services, and\nits institutional objectives include: increasing\noperational efficiency of PT services, improving\nmobility of urban and rural populations and the\ndevelopment of environmentally sustainable PT\nservices,\n Jordan Maritime Commission (JMC) was\nestablished by royal decree in 2002 under the\ntitle of Jordan Maritime Authority. The name was\nrevised to JMC in 2014. JMC operates under the\nJordan Maritime Authority Law No. (46) Issued\nin 2006. Its function is to regulate, supervise and\ndevelop the maritime sector,\n The Jordan-Hejaz Railway Corporation was\nestablished in 1952, and it manages and\ninvests in the properties of the railway between\nMa’an and the Syrian border. It was used for\ntransporting freight between Jordan and Syria\nup until services were stopped about 10 years\nago as a result of the conflict in Syria.\nGreater Amman Municipality which has almost\n40% of the population of Jordan is responsible for\nall PT taking place completely inside its borders, an\narea of 800 km2. This responsibility was assumed\nin 2007 based on a law granting the municipality,\nplanning and regulatory authorities over PT. The\nintegrated Transportation and Traffic Management\nDirectorate was established shortly after this, to\nbring together these newly granted roles with\nGAM’s existing traffic engineering functions.\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA)\nwas created in 2001, within the Aqaba Governorate\nas a separate governance entity, covering an area\nof 375 km2 around the port city of Aqaba, including\nJordan’s entire 27 km marine coastline. ASEZA\nhas held responsibility for PT within the Aqaba\nMunicipality and between Amman and Aqaba\nsince 2000. ASEZA is also responsible for the port\nareas, the King Hussein International Airport and\nthe section of the Hejaz Railway between Aqaba\nand Ma’an and the additional link to the phosphate\nmines.\n\n31\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nMinistry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH)\nundertakes the construction and development\nof the network of roads in the country and is\nresponsible for setting plans and preparing the\nstudies and designs necessary for their construction.\nIn addition, they undertake tasks assigned by the\nGovernment of Jordan. A similar role is carried\nout within Greater Amman Municipality by the\nDepartment of Public Works and Housing within\nGAM and in Aqaba by the Department of Public\nWorks within ASEZA.\n1.10 Industry\nJordan is attractive for foreign investments in the\nMiddle East primarily due to its political stability\nand its central location in the region. Industry in\nJordan is principally dominated by manufacturing\nand mining.\nQualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) are business parks\nthat are recognized as free trade zones set up in\ncollaboration with the United States. Jordan is\none of two countries to have this arrangement,\nthe other being Egypt.\nIn Jordan, the Qualified Industrial Zones are:\n Al-Hassan Industrial Estate,\n Al-Hussein Ibn Abdullah II Industrial Estate,\n Jordan Industrial Estate Corporation,\n Jordan Cyber City,\n Al-Tajamouat Industrial Estate,\n Gateway QIZ,\n Aqaba Industrial Estate,\n Ad-Dulayl Industrial Park,\n El-Zai Ready-wear Manufacturing Company.\nThe manufacturing sector includes leather and\nfootwear manufacturing, chemicals, plastics, IT,\nfurniture, food, packaging, and manufacturing\nof engineering technology. The contribution of\nmanufacturing to GDP increased to 1347 million\nJD in the second quarter of 2019 from 1208.80 JD\nMillion in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining industry sector is one of the most\nimportant strategic industries. Mining contributes\nto the employment of local labor and caters to the\nneeds of the market for raw materials, while being\na source of hard currency.\nThe contribution of mining to GDP increased to\n175 million JD in the second quarter of 2019 from\n162.8 million JD in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe mining sector consists of the following subsectors:\n Phosphate and potash,\n Cement and chalk mining,\n Mining and extraction of limestone to produce\ncalcium carbonate,\n Mining and manufacturing kaolin, gypsum, and\nsilica,\n Extracting and crushing stone tablets, slabs,\nmarble, and granite stones and sand.\nPhosphate and potash are the most significant\nnatural resources in Jordan. The sector relies\nprimarily on large investments, driving several\nfirms to invest in such a promising field. The\nmining sector is the third largest industrial sector\nin terms of invested capital and the fourth largest\nsector in terms of exports in 2014. It also ranked\nfirst in terms of foreign investments in Jordan.\nMoreover, products from mining are used as\nraw material inputs for other industries such as\nfertilizers. Positive outlooks loom large as domestic\nvalue-added activities are increasingly combined\nwith investing in other areas, such as shale oil and\nuranium. This requires activating the exploitation\nof untapped raw materials in the Kingdom to\ncreate products that meet the global demand\nfor energy.      \n1.11 Waste Management\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of a high\npopulation growth rate and enforced migration.\nEconomic and cultural development has improved\nthe standard of living and changed consumer\nhabits, resulting in an increase in the volume of\nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) over time. No official\n\n32\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nstatistics have been disclosed regarding the\nincrease in solid waste generation after the influx\nof Syrian refugees. However, preliminary official\nestimates refer to more than 20-35% increase\nin solid waste generation in Jordan following\nthe Syrian crisis, putting a substantial burden\non municipalities as well as on the surrounding\necosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan. Solid\nwaste collected from 100 municipalities is then\ntransported to transfer stations, sanitary landfills\nor open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded landfills\nin the country, most of which are not properly\ndesigned or operated, demonstrated by their lack\nof proper lining, leachate collection system, and\nlandfill gas management system. The only sanitary\nlandfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which receives 50%\nof the waste produced in Amman and Zarqa. AlGhabawi landfill is located 23 km to the East of\nAmman over an area of 2,000 Dunums, enough to\ndispose waste until 2035, using safe refuse/tipping\ntechniques. The Greater Amman Municipality\npurchased 1,000 Dunums from surrounding lands\nto rent out to the private sector to encourage\ninvestment in waste segregation and recycling.\nIn 1989, the Government of Jordan designated\nSwaqa landfill, 125 km to the South-East of\nAmman, as a facility to process hazardous\nwaste. The landfill is overseen and operated\nby the Ministry of Environment. The Ministry of\nEnvironment has also founded a centre in Swaqa\nlandfill to oversee the disposal of electronic waste\nin a safe manner to discourage improper storage\nand illegal re-selling. In general, the sector is in\nneed of studies to investigate the potential of\nwaste recycling.\nIt’s important to note that Bio-waste (organic\nwaste) dominates MSW; approximately 60% are\nfood waste, 14% paper and cardboards, 10%\nplastics. Therefore, MSW contains sufficient\nputrescible material which emit LFG (methane\n& CO2) for many years presenting a long-term\nexplosive and toxic hazard. Additionally, hazardous\nand non-MSW are not segregated and continue\nto reach final disposal sites posing serious health\nrisks for workers.\nIn Jordan, 48% of MSW is landfilled, 45% is\nopenly dumped and only 7% recycled. As a\nmatter of fact, recycling is mostly done by waste\npickers informally with no operational facility in\nplace. Furthermore, it is estimated that in 2034,\nMSW will reach 5.2 million tonnes (EC, 2016).\nConsidering these foreseeable challenges, in 2015\nthe Government of Jordan took a step forward\nwith the Decision No. 11392/02, and approved\nits first National Solid Waste Management\nStrategy 2015-2034 (NSWMS) in line with the\nrevised EU Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/\nEC which focuses on waste prevention and with\nthe EU-Jordan Compact 2016-2020 which sets\nthe sustainable use and management of natural\nresources as one of its priorities. The Strategy’s\nmain objective is to renovate the old, inefficient,\ncostly and environmentally unstable municipal\nsolid waste management system and convert it to\na modern and integrated one using the Three R’s\napproach (Reduce-Reuse-Recycle) within a span\nof 20 years. In particular, it seeks to prohibit the\nunsafe disposal of MSW and omit the disposal\nof industrial, construction, and medical wastes\nfrom facilities. In numeric-terms, 50% of existing\ndumpsites should be closed and 20 new transfer\nstations plus 10 new sanitary landfills should be\nconstructed (NSWMS, 2015).\n\n33\nNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nNo.\nSubject of Target\nProposed Targets for Jordan\nShort-term\nPeriod (20152019)\nMid-term\nPeriod (20202024)\nLong-term\nPeriod (20252034)\n1\nCatering for the emergency needs for\nMSWM due to the refugees’ influx\nDone\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n(if the situation\ncontinues)\n2\nCoverage of MSW street-cleaning and\ncollection services\n100%\n3\nSet-up of separate collection systems for\nrecyclables (at least paper, metal, plastic\nand glass)\n-\n100 % by 2034\n4\nPreparing for re-use and recycling of\nMSW materials (at least paper, metal,\nplastic and glass)\n-\n50% by weight\nby 2034\n5\nCease of operation of uncontrolled or\nunlicensed disposal sites\n50% by 2019\n100% by 2024\n6\nReduction of bio-waste ending-up to\nlandfills\n-\n75% by weight\nby 2034\n(according to\n2024 amounts)\n7\nRecovery of packaging waste (including\nreuse, materials’ recovery and energy\nrecovery)\n-\n25% by weight\nby 2034\n8\nRecycling of packaging waste\n-\n15% by weight\nby 2034\nReferences\n Ben-Sasson, M., Brenner, S., and Paldor, N.

Other gases\nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, such\nas sulphur oxides (SOx), included in the IPCC\nGuidelines may be included at the discretion\nof the Parties.\nThe GHG national inventory chapter addresses\nemissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide\n(N2O), methane (CH4), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons\n(PFCs). Those gases are supported by the\nsoftware and the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines. Nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)\nemissions resulting from the solvents subsector\nwere estimated using European Monitoring and\nEvaluation Programme (EMEP/EEA) air pollutant\nemission inventory guidebook 2019.\n2.2 Institutional Arrangements\nThe Ministry of Environment is the focal point for\nissues relevant to the UNFCCC and is responsible\nfor ensuring that Jordan’s commitments are met.\nPreparation of Jordan’s Second Biennial Update\nReport (SBUR) was coordinated by the Ministry of\nEnvironment in partnership with UNDP.\nAn agreement with the Royal Scientific Society\n(a national non-governmental, not-for-profit\nscientific organization) was realized to achieve\nthe work. The GHG inventory development was\naccomplished with the participation of a pool of\nnational experts representing different national\nentities, as demonstrated by the organizational\nchart in Figure 2.1.\n\n39\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.1: GHG inventory organizational chart\n\n40\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.3 Methodology and Inventory Estimation\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated for the\nyears 2016 according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines and\nthe 2019 Refinement1 to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\nThe estimation of the overall national inventory\nwas carried out using the IPCC Inventory Software\nfor Parties not included in Annex I of the UNFCCC\n(ver. 2.691, released on 23 January 2020).\nThe sectors and subsectors that were considered\nare the following:\n1.\tEnergy:\n Stationary Combustion,\n Mobile Combustion,\n Fugitive Emissions.\n2.\tIndustrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU):\n Mineral Industry Emissions,\n Chemical Industry Emissions,\n Metal Industry Emissions,\n Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent\nUse,\n Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for Ozone\nDepleting Substances and Other Product\nManufacture and Use.\n3.\tAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU):\n Cropland and Forest Land,\n Emissions from Livestock and Manure\nManagement,\n N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2\nEmissions from Lime and Urea Application.\n4.\tWaste Generation, Composition, and\nManagement Data:\n Solid Waste Disposal,\n Biological Treatment of Solid Waste,\n Incineration and Open Burning of Waste,\n Wastewater Treatment and Discharge.\nIn May 2019 at IPCC 49th Session, the 2019\nRefinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories was adopted\nby the IPCC in Kyoto, Japan (Decision IPCC-XLIX-9).\nThe IPCC authors have examined a wide range\nof inventory methodologies and updated them,\nwhere scientific advances and new knowledge\nmade this necessary, following the IPCC decision.\nThe 2019 Refinement does not revise the 2006\nGuidelines, but updates, supplements and/or\nelaborates the 2006 Guidelines where gaps or\nout of date science have been identified. It will\nnot replace the 2006 Guidelines, and should be\nused in conjunction with the 2006 Guidelines.\nThe structure of 2019 Refinement is the same\nstructure as that of the 2006 Guidelines to make\nit easier for inventory compilers to use the 2019\nRefinement with the 2006 Guidelines. It includes\nan Overview Chapter and five volumes (General\nGuidance and Reporting (GGR), Energy, IPPU,\nAgriculture, AFOLU and Waste). The changes are\nindicated in each volume as Annex “Mapping\ntable” listing the types of refinements that have\nbeen done on the volume.\nIn brief, the main changes that were introduced\nto the different volumes are as follows:\n In Volume 1, adding a new guidance to all\nchapters,\n In Volume 2, introducing methodological issues\nin the stationary combustion and in the fugitive\nemissions chapters; adding new section for fuel\ntransformation and updating emission factors.\nAdditionally, updating the worksheet of the oil\nand natural gas systems,\n In volume 3, including updates for the emission\nfactors, and adding a new section for hydrogen\nproduction,\n In Volume 4, developing new guidance,\nupdating carbon stock change factors and\ndeveloping a new tier 2 method that requires\nless activity data than the current default\nmethod.\n1. All updates, supplements and/or elaborates on the 2006\nGuidelines were identified and adopted in this chapter.\n\n41\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n Finally, in volume 5, updating the default data,\nupdating the wastewater treatment chapter\nto reflect additional types of treatment and\ndisposal systems.\nThe guidance on appropriate estimation methods\nwithin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines that includes\ncross-sectoral good practice guidance for\ninventory preparation were consulted. It includes\nmethods for collection of activity data, key\ncategory analysis, quality assurance and control,\nand inventory planning and documentation.\nInventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nand in units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by sources and removals by sinks. Most\nsectors and subsectors used Tier 1.\nIndirect GHGs were estimated, whenever the\nactivity data were available, using the EMEP\nGuidelines and methodology.\nFor reporting purposes, the notation keys NO\n(not occurring) or NE (not estimated) and NA\n(not applicable) were used as necessary in the\ninventory reporting tables.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC Second Assessment Report\n(SAR) temporal horizon 100 years were used. The\nfollowing sections report Jordan’s GHG inventories\nby sector and on a gas by gas basis.\n2.4 GHG Inventories by Sector\nAccording to the overall GHG Inventory estimates,\nJordan contributed 31,063.32 Gg of CO2eq in 2016.\nA breakdown of Jordan’s total emissions of GHGs\nby sector indicated that the Energy Sector is the\nmajor emitter accounting for around 76% of\ntotal national emissions followed by the Waste\nSector with a contribution of around 12%. GHG\nemissions by sector in 2016 are shown in Table\n2.1 and Figure 2.2.\nTable 2.1: GHG aggregate emissions in Gg CO2eq by sector, 2016\nCategories\nEmissions\nGg CO2 eq\nPercentage of the\noverall\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n31,063.32\n100%\nEnergy\n23,649.47\n76.13%\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use\n3,177.42\n10.23%\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n428.71\n1.38%\nWaste\n3,807.73\n12.26%\n\n42\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.2: GHG aggregate emissions (%) by sector, 2016\nIn the sections below, a detailed description is\ngiven for the emissions resulting from the sectors\nin year 2016.\n2.4.1 Energy sector\nJordan currently imports around 93% of its total\nenergy comprising almost 8% of Jordan’s GDP and\nplacing a strain on its economy (MEMR, 2019). The\nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources has\nrecently published the National Energy Sector\nStrategy for 2020-2030. This is a ten-year plan\nwhich aims at setting the roadmap to increase selfsufficiency through utilization of domestic natural\nand renewable resources, as well as expansion\nof existing energy developments thus reducing\nreliance on costly foreign fuel imports that burden\nits economy.\nThe main objectives for the energy sector as per\nthe strategy:\n Diversification of energy sources by increasing\nthe contribution of local energy sources to the\ntotal energy mix,\n Increasing energy efficiency in all sectors,\n Reducing energy costs for the national economy,\n Developing the energy sector system in Jordan\nto make it a regional centre for the exchange of\nenergy in all its forms.\nMoreover, the new National Strategy (2020-2030)\nidentified renewable energy usage alongside other\nsources as follows:\n Renewable energy to contribute 31% of\nelectricity generation by the year 2030,\n Increasing energy efficiency in the water sector\nby 15% by 2025,\n Improving efficient energy consumption in all\nsectors by 9%.\nThe forecast growth in renewable energy usage\nwill enable the country to enhance energy security,\nto improve access to affordable energy, to create\njobs, and to meet a significant part of the NDCs\ntarget by 2030. The total renewable capacity by\nthe end of 2018 was 1,130 MW and was expected\nto reach 2,400 MW by the end of 2020, accounting\nfor 20% of the generated electricity, compared\nto 1% in 2014 (MEMR, 2018). The largest energy\nconsumer in 2018 was the transport sector with a\n49% share followed by household, industrial and\nother services sectors with 21.5%, 15.5% and 14%\nshare respectively.\n\n43\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nEnergy-related activities have a dominant share\nof GHG emissions in Jordan. Emissions from this\nsector are classified into two main categories:\n Emissions from fuel combustion,\n Non-combustion (fugitive) emissions.\nGHGs Emissions in 2016\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n23,649.47 Gg of CO2eq in 2016, resulting primarily\nfrom fuel combustion activities, as shown in Table\n2.2. Fugitive emissions (from oil and natural gas)\nwere negligible, accounting for less than 2%.\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with shares of 37%\nand 38% respectively. Emissions resulting from\n“Manufacturing Industries and Construction”\nand “Other sectors” (Residential, Commercial,\nand Agriculture) accounted for 10% and 10%\nrespectively of the total, as indicated in Figure 2.3.\nTable 2.2: Energy sector aggregated emissions, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\nCH4\nN2O\nAggregated\nemissions in\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nGg\nGg of CO2 eq\nENERGY SECTOR\n23,054.59\n439.38\n155.49\n23,649.47\nFuel Combustion Activities\n23,032.67\n60.10\n155.39\n23,248.15\nEnergy Industries\n8,956.12\n4.35\n9.12\n8,969.59\nManufacturing Industries and Construction\n2,432.06\n1.41\n7.01\n2,440.47\nTransport\n8,609.48\n43.73\n133.50\n8,786.71\nOther Sectors (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture)\n2,354.95\n8.88\n4.40\n2,368.23\nNon-Specified\n680.06\n1.73\n1.36\n683.15\nFugitive emissions (Oil and Natural Gas)\n21.92\n379.29\n0.10\n401.31\nFigure 2.3: Shares of emission (%) per subsector within the energy sector, 2016\n\n44\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nInternational Bunkers, 2016\nAs per Decision 17/CP, to the extent possible, and\nif data are available, non-Annex I Parties should\nreport emissions from international aviation and\ninternational water-borne navigation separately\nin their inventories. Emission estimates from these\nsources should not be included in the national\ntotals and should be reported only as information\nitems.

The southern and eastern parts of the\ncountry are arid with hot dry summers and cold\ndry winters. Temperature increases towards the\nsouth, with exceptions in some southern highlands.\nPrecipitation is extremely variable and is confined\nlargely to the winter and early spring seasons. It\nranges from over 500mm in the highlands to less\nthan 50mm in the east. The long-term average\nannual precipitation is 8,317 million cubic meters,\nof which, about 92.5% is lost to evaporation. The\nEastern Desert (also known as the Badia) that\nlies east of the mountainous region and covers\nabout 80% of the land area of Jordan has a low\nprecipitation (the Updated Rangeland Strategy\nfor Jordan, 2014).\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture 2018\nstatistical report, cultivated land accounts for (2.32.8 million dunums). On average, irrigated areas\ncomprise around 1 million dunums (60% of the\ncultivated areas), whereas on average rainfed areas\nmake up around 1.5 million dunums (40% of the\ncultivated areas).\nThe contribution of agriculture to the GDP, in\nrelative terms, declined sharply from 40% in\nthe 1950s to 4.8% in 2018. Irrespective of how\nhumble the contribution of agriculture is to GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of the agricultural\nsector stems from the fact that it is not only a major\nsource of food, particularly dairy products, fruits\nand vegetables, but it is also a source of livelihood\nfor around 25-30% of the total poor population\n(livestock keepers, smallholder farm households,\nand landless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas (World Bank- Technical Note, 2018).\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nThe GHG emissions of AFOLU activities accounted\nfor around 1.38% (428.71 Gg of CO2eq) of Jordan’s\ntotal GHG emissions in 2016, acting as a net\nemission source. The emissions were composed\nof methane and nitrous oxide and were generated\nby various subcategories. AFOLU emissions and\nremovals are shown in Table 2.6 and Figure 2.5.\n\n47\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.6: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2016\nCategories\nNet CO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nNet\n(Gg CO2 eq)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nAgriculture, Forestry, and\nOther Land Use\n-896.76\n614.6\n710.9\n428.71\nLivestock\nNA\n610\n20.44\n630.45\nLand\n-922.54\nNA\nNA\n-922.54\nAggregate sources and nonCO2 emissions sources on land\n25.78\n4.611\n690.4\n720.80\nFigure 2.5: Emissions of the AFOLU sector (Gg CO2eq), 2016\n2.4.4 Waste sector\nJordan has experienced a large increase in\npopulation over the past decade as a result of\na high population growth rate and enforced\nmigration. Economic and cultural development\nhave improved the standard of living and changed\nconsumer habits, resulting in an increase in the\nvolume of MSW over time. No official statistics\nhave been disclosed regarding the increase in\nsolid waste generation after the influx of Syrian\nrefugees. However, preliminary official estimates\nrefer to more than a 20-35% increase in solid waste\ngeneration in Jordan following the Syrian crisis,\nputting a substantial burden on municipalities as\nwell as on the surrounding ecosystems.\nMSW management, is one of the most important\nservices provided by municipalities in Jordan.\nSolid waste collected from 100 municipalities\nis then transported to transfer stations, sanitary\nlandfills or open dumpsites. There are 18 recorded\nlandfills in the country, most of which are not\nproperly designed or operated, demonstrated\nby their lack of proper lining, leachate collection\nsystem, and landfill gas management system. The\nonly sanitary landfill is Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nreceives 50% of the waste produced in Amman\nand Zarqa. Al-Ghabawi landfill is located 23 km\nto the east of Amman, and covers an area of over\n2,000 Dunums, enough to dispose waste until 2035,\nusing safe refuse/tipping techniques. Additionally,\nGg CO2eq\n\n48\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nthe Greater Amman Municipality purchased 1,000\ndunums from surrounding lands to rent out to the\nprivate sector to encourage investment in waste\nsegregation and recycling.\nGHG Emissions in 2016\nIn 2016, GHG emissions from the waste sector\nreached 3,807.73 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for\n12% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions. Most of\nthe emissions were generated by domestic solid\nwaste disposal, which accounted for around 93%\n(3559.01 Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions,\nwhile wastewater handling accounted for 5%\n(188.40Gg of CO2eq) of total waste emissions.\nTable 2.7 and Figure 2.6 show 2016 emissions\nbreakdown by the waste sector.\nTable 2.7: Emissions of the waste sector, 2016\nCategories\nCO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\nN2O\nTotal CO2eq\n(Gg)\n(Gg CO2 eq)\nWaste\n32.66\n3,621.50\n153.58\n3807.73\nSolid Waste Disposal\nNA\n3,559.01\nNA\n3,559.01\nIncineration and Open Burning of Waste\n32.66\n23.11\n4.56\n60.32\nWastewater Treatment and Discharge\nNA\n39.38\n149.02\n188.40\nFigure 2.6: Emissions (%) by the waste sector, 2016\n\n49\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n2.5 GHG Inventory by Gas\n2.5.1 GHG Emissions in 2016\nThe share of carbon dioxide was the largest with a contribution of 24,385.37 Gg, accounting for 79%\nof all GHGs emissions, followed by CH4 with a contribution of 4,675.49 Gg of CO2eq at only 15%, as\nindicated in Figure 2.7.\nFigure 2.7: National emissions (%) by gas, 2016\nIn 2016, the majority of carbon dioxide emissions\nwere produced by the energy sector accounting for\n95%, followed by 9% from the IPPU sector. Methane\nemissions were highest from the waste sector\nfollowed by the AFOLU sector with contributions of\n70% and 17%, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions\nwere highest from the AFOLU sector with 57%,\nfollowed by the IPPU, Energy and waste sectors, with\ncontributions of 18%, 13% and 12%, respectively.\nAs expected, the IPPU sector contributed 100% of\nHFCs while the NMVOCs emissions resulted from\nthe IPPU and the energy sectors.\nWithin the energy sector, the main emissions were\nin the form of CO2 (97%). Within the IPPU sector,\nthe key GHGs were CO2 followed by HFCs with\nshares of 69% and 24%, respectively. Nitrous oxide\nemissions were highest from the AFOLU sector, with\naround 57% mainly from fertilizers and manure\nmanagement.

This approach\nprovides estimates of CO2 to compare with\nestimates derived using a Sectoral Approach. The\nReference Approach provides an upper bound\nto the Sectoral Approach ‘1A Fuel Combustion’,\nbecause some of the carbon in the fuel is not\ncombusted but is released as fugitive emissions\n(as leakage or evaporation in the production\nand/or transformation stage). Calculating CO2\nemissions with the two approaches can lead to\ndifferent results for some countries.\nThe Reference Approach was used to calculate\nenergy sector emissions in 2016 and the results\nwere compared to those of the Sectoral Approach.\nThe gap between the two approaches should\nbe relatively small (5% or less). For Jordan, the\ncalculated differences were acceptable; less than\n5%, as indicated in Table 2.11.\nTable 2.11: Reference approach vs sectoral approach for the year 2016\nYear\nReference Approach\nSectoral\nDifference\nCO2 Emissions (Gg)\n%\n2016\n24,017.75\n23,043.18\n4.23\nGHG emissions were also estimated using the\nReference Approach for the time series (2013-2016)\n(Table 2.12 and Figure 2.9).\nThe outcomes indicated a steady increase in\nthe energy consumption for 2013-2016, and\nan unexpected decrease in 2015 emissions was\nnoticed which was due to a change in the energy\nmix of electricity generation in the form of using\nnatural gas a less carbon intense fuel than Diesel.\nTable 2.12: Energy consumption and emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\nYear\nEnergy Consumption (TJ)\nCO2 (Gg)\n2013\n317,581.57\n22,772.64\n2014\n327,784.75\n24,136.90\n2015\n345,185.21\n23,936.91\n2016\n379,660.75\n24,017.75\n\n55\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nFigure 2.9: Variations in emissions for the time series (2013-2016)\n2.8 Time Series and Comparison between\nCurrent and Previous Inventories\nThe time series is a central component of the\ngreenhouse gas inventory because it provides\ninformation on historical emissions trends and\ntracks the effects of strategies to reduce emissions\nat the national level. As is the case with estimates for\nindividual years, emission trends should be neither\nover nor underestimated as far as can be judged.\nAll emissions estimates in a time series should be\nestimated consistently, which means that as far\nas possible, the time series should be calculated\nusing the same method and data sources in all\nyears. Using different methods and data in a time\nseries could introduce bias because the estimated\nemission trend will reflect not only real changes\nin emissions or removals but also the pattern of\nmethodological refinements. Chapter five, volume\none of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was consulted\nin terms of good practices ensuring time series\nconsistency.\nRecalculations were carried out for the years\n2010 and 2012. Also, techniques for combining\nor “splicing” different methods or data sets to\ncompensate for incomplete or missing data were\nused for estimating years the 2000 and 2006.\nFigure 2.10 and Table 2.13 provides an overview\nof time series estimation:\n As expected, an increase in GHG emissions\nwas noticed between the different years due\nto population growth and increased economic\nactivities,\n The category 1.B - Fugitive emissions from fuels\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 were recalculated\nusing the correct emissions factor for onshore\n- developing country and this resulted in new\nfigures (from 1.02 and 1.26 Gg CO2eq to 235.98\nGg CO2eq and 336.75 Gg CO2eq respectively),\n Also, the 2.D - Non-Energy Products from Fuels\nand Solvent Use category was recalculated\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 due to an error in\nemission factor unit conversion. Results were\nmodified from 208.80 Gg CO2eq and 226.88 Gg\nCO2eq to 2.85 Gg CO2eq and 3.09 Gg CO2eq,\n All sectors for 1994 will be calculated as part of\nthe third BUR.

Non-Annex I Parties are\nencouraged (Decision 17/CP.8), to the extent\npossible, to undertake any key category analysis\nto assist in developing inventories that better\nreflect their national circumstances. The analysis\nwas carried out based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines\nand Software. Jordan used “level” key category\nanalysis where the contribution of each source or\nsink category to the total national inventory level\nwas calculated. The key categories according to the\nguidelines are those that, when summed together\nin descending order of magnitude, add up to 95%\nof the sum of all level assessment.\nIn categories that are identified as key, parties\nshould try to use a recommended method, in\naccordance with the corresponding decision tree\nin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It is recommended\nthat Jordan searches for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to the\nextent possible and based on software readiness\nand national circumstances, Tier 2 methods in the\ncategories identified as key.\nAs shown in Table 2.14 for the year 2016, the key\ncategory analysis resulted in thirteen subcategories;\nthe top four accounting for around 64.9% of all\nemissions, were:\n Fuel Combustion Activities subcategories:\nEnergy Industries (Gaseous Fuels), Road\nTransportation, Energy Industries (Liquid Fuels),\nand other sectors (commercial/institutional and\nresidential-Liquid Fuels),\n The solid waste management subcategory.\n\n58\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nTable 2.14: Key category analysis (level assessment), 2016\nA\nB\nC\nD\nF\nG\nIPCC\nCategory\ncode\nIPCC Category\nGHG\n2016\nEmissions\nCO2eq (Gg)\n2016\nEmissions\nLevel from\nthe Given\nCategory\nCumulative Total\n% of Column F\n1.A.3.b\nRoad Transportation\nCO2\n8566.56\n0.26\n26.4%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nGaseous Fuels\nCO2\n6495.61\n0.20\n46.3%\n4.A\nSolid Waste Disposal\nCH4\n3559.01\n0.11\n57.3%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nLiquid Fuels\nCO2\n2460.51\n0.08\n64.9%\n1.A.4\nOther Sectors - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2365.46\n0.07\n72.1%\n2.A.1\nCement production\nCO2\n1751.43\n0.05\n77.5%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n1669.84\n0.05\n82.7%\n3.B.1.a\nForest land Remaining\nForest land\nCO2\n-922.77\n0.03\n85.5%\n2.F.1\nRefrigeration and Air\nConditioning\nHFCs,\nPFCs\n762.23\n0.02\n87.9%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Solid\nFuels\nCO2\n737.23\n0.02\n90.1%\n1.A.5\nNon-Specified - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n680.06\n0.02\n92.2%\n3.A.1\nEnteric Fermentation\nCH4\n574.08\n0.02\n94.0%\n3.C.4\nDirect N2O Emissions\nfrom managed soils\nN2O\n510.55\n0.02\n95.6%\n2.10 Uncertainty Analysis\nThe uncertainty analysis is one of the main activities\nof the inventory process. Uncertainty information\nis intended to help prioritize efforts to improve the\naccuracy of inventories and guide decisions on the\nmethodological choice.\nThe analysis was carried out based on IPCC 2006\nGuidelines and Software. “Approach 1: Propagation\nof Error” was used. Approach 1 is based upon error\npropagation and is used to estimate uncertainty in\nindividual categories in the inventory as a whole,\nand in trends between 2016 and the base year\n2010. The uncertainty analysis was based on\nTier 1 approach and covers all source-categories\nand all direct greenhouse gases. The uncertainty\nestimation for the activity data and emission factors\nwas based on typical values of the IPCC.\nThe results indicate that net emissions in 2016\nwere 26,794.86 Gg of CO2eq with an uncertainty\nof ±5%, which corresponds to a 95% probability\n\n59\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nrange of 27,598.71 to 25,991.01 Gg of CO2eq. Based\nupon the total base year of 2010 and year 2016\ninventories, the average trend is a 34% increase\nin emissions from 2010 to 2016. The uncertainty\nin the trend is ±4% (percentage points), which\ncorresponds to a 95% probability range for the\ntrend with respect to base year emissions.\n2.11 GHG Inventory Quality Control/Quality\nAssurance and Review\nJordan acknowledges the need for having a manual\nfor national QC/QA procedures for GHG inventory\nestimation. This has been listed in Jordan’s future\nimprovement plans (section 2.12). Also, during the\npreparation of the GHG Inventories, the inventory\nteam and the BUR project management team\ncarried out the following tasks:\n Overall assessment technical reviews, and\naccuracy checks performed by the compilers\nto ensure consistency, accuracy, completeness\nand avoid double counting,\n Checking the accuracy of data input from the\noriginal references and confirm that correct\nreferences were used as well as ensuring that\nno transcription errors exist,\n Checking that parameter and emission units\nare correctly recorded and that appropriate\nconversion factors are used and checking as\nwell for consistency if more than one expert\nused same conversions and factor among\nvarious subsectors,\n Checking that the movement of inventory data\namong processing steps is correct,\n Checking that there is detailed internal\ndocumentation to support the estimates and\nenable full reconstruction of the estimate,\n Checking that inventory data are archived and\nstored to facilitate detailed review,\nIn terms of quality assurance the national GHG\ninventory chapter was subjected to an international\nreview which was coordinated by the UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Program (GSP) and was conducted\nfrom 7 to 13 October 2020 by Dr. Carlos López,\nconsultant in national GHG emissions inventories.\nThe review examined mainly the adherence of the\ninventory chapter to the requirements indicated in\nthe UNFCCC Decision 17/CP.8 Annex, the UNFCCC\nDecision 2/CP.17 Annex III, and to the advice of\nthe IPCC Guidelines and Guidance. The outcomes\nof the review resulted in several direct actions\nto improve the chapter and an inventory future\nimprovement plan (IIP); described in details in the\nfollowing section.\n2.12 Future Improvement Plan\nSeveral actions were identified by the GSP\nreviewer. The improvements are listed below\nand are rated according to urgency as; immediate,\nshort term and long term actions:\n\tThe activity data used in the estimate, especially\nin the subcategories identified as key or\nsignificant , should be improved as much as\npossible, in order to use tier 2. Also, actions to\nimprove data, methods, EF and other estimation\nparameters (OEP) should be prioritized in\nkey categories to use tier 2 (especially in the\nsubcategory 2F1a, 4A Solid Waste Disposal,\n3A1c Sheep and 3B Land). (short term and\nlong term),\n\tThe documentation boxes and worksheet\nremarks included within the software should\nbe added. (short term),\n\tThe completeness of the inventory should be\nimproved by: (short term to long term),\n- Improving the estimation and reporting of\nprecursor gas emissions in future inventory\nsubmissions (activity data and EF are mostly\navailable),\n- Incorporating among the precursor gases,\nthe estimation of NH3 emissions. This would\nmake it possible to calculate in category 5A\nthe indirect N2O Emissions derived from the\natmospheric deposition of Nitrogen from non\nagriculture sources,\n- The precursor gas emissions of these\nsubcategories from the second order\nsubcategories 1.A.3.a.i - International aviation\n\n60\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nand 1.A.3.d.i - International water-borne\nnavigation (international bunkers) should\nbe estimated and should be reported; using\nthe notation key NE (not-estimated) in the\nreporting tables, as necessary,\n The key analysis -trend assessment should be\nused after improving issues related to the time\nseries of the inventory. Also, qualitative criteria\nshould be applied to the categories located\nat the threshold of 95-97% of cumulative\nemissions. (short term),\n Prepare a QA/QC and verification plan and\nmanual for the coming inventory (short term).\nReferences\n\t2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and its 2019 Refinement.\n\tAmman Chamber of Industry Website, http://www.aci.org.jo, accessed December, 2019.\n\tArab Fertilizers and Chemical Industries (Kemapco).\n\tAmman Chamber of Industry Website, http://www.aci.org.jo, accessed December 2016.\n\tAmount and Characterization of Dairy Cattle Manure and Poultry Litter in Jordan, AECOM, August\n2014.\n\tCentral Bank of Jordan – Statistical Database, http://statisticaldb.cbj.gov.jo/index, accessed December\n2019.\n\tCustoms Department, letter No. 18/14/131 dated 8/1/2020\n\tDepartment of Statistics website: www.web.dos.gov.jo accessed May 2020\n\tDepartment of statistics, Jordan’s country analysis; environmental indicators, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2010,\n2012, and 2016.\n\tEnergy and Minerals Regulatory Commission (EMRC).\n\tEEA, 2019.

Name and description of the mitigation\naction, including information on the nature\nof the action, coverage (i.e. sectors and gases),\nquantitative goals and progress indicators;\nb.\nInformation on methodologies and\nassumptions;\nc. Objectives of the action and steps taken or\nenvisaged to achieve that action;\nd.\nInformation\non\nthe\nprogress\nof\nimplementation of the mitigation actions\nand the underlying steps taken or envisaged,\nand the results achieved, such as estimated\noutcomes (metrics depending on type of\naction) and estimated emission reductions,\nto the extent possible;\ne. Information on international market\nmechanisms.\n\tParties should provide information on the\ndescription\nof\ndomestic\nmeasurement,\nreporting and verification arrangements.\n(Detailed in chapter4 of this report).\nBased on the above requirements, this chapter has\nbeen prepared to update the baseline scenario\nand the FBUR mitigation measures as briefly\ndescribed in the following paragraphs.\n\tUpdate of the baseline scenario: A baseline\nscenario reflects a future in which there are\nno policies or programs designed to encourage\nor require actions that reduce GHG emissions\nor enhance carbon sinks.\n The FBUR baseline scenario was updated\nfor all economic sectors of energy, industry,\nagriculture and forestry in addition to the\nwaste sector, based on the strategies, policies\nand plans prevailing in the Jordanian context\nduring the time of preparation of this SBUR\n(2020). This requires a projection of the current\nlevels to future levels of each type of activity.\nThe newly released strategies, policies, action\nplans and committed projects were reviewed\nand summarized. In addition, all projects and\nactions that were part of FBUR baseline scenario\nwere reviewed to update their status. Based on\nthis review, the most probable future trends in\nactivities that will impact and shape the GHG\nemissions are highlighted.\nStrategies, policies and action plans that were\nreviewed to prepare the updated baseline scenario\ninclude:\n-\nThe new Energy National Strategy for 20202030, issued in April 2020,\n-\nThe\n2020-2025\nNational\nAgricultural\nDevelopment Strategy, issued in August\n2020,\n-\nThe\nnew\nsolid\nwaste\nmanagement\nframework law issued in March 2020 and\nentered in force in September 2020,\n-\nNational Renaissance Plan (2019-2020),\nissued in 2018,\n-\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021),\nissued in 2017,\n- The Industrial Policy (2017-2021), issued in 2016,\n Update of FBUR mitigation measures: All\nFBUR mitigation projects were reviewed and\nassessed to identify all those still valid. The\nvalid projects were updated, after adjustments\nwere made in their expected implementation\ntimeline. The emission reduction and the unit\ncost of emission reduction for each mitigation\nproject have been recalculated taking into\nconsideration several factors such as the\n\n65\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nimprovement in technologies and changes\nin prices. Net present value was used in the\nfinancial calculations, by converting all present\nand future revenues and costs over the project’s\nlifetime to a base of today’s cost. The same\napproach was followed in calculating the CO2eq\nemissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nmitigation projects. A discount rate of 8% was\nused for both the cost and emission reduction\ncalculations. Also, the discounted unit cost of\nreduced emission reduction was calculated as\nthe quotient of the discounted cost in JD to\nthe discounted emission in tonnes CO2. The\nupdated FBUR mitigation projects include\n23 GHG mitigation measures in the sectors\nand subsectors of primary energy, renewable\nenergy, energy efficiency, industries, domestic\nsolid waste and wastewater, and agriculture\nand forestry.\n3.2 Baseline Scenario for the Different Sectors\n3.2.1 Baseline scenario for the energy sector\nA. The Current Status of the Infrastructure\nEnergy Projects Listed in the FBUR\nA.1 The delayed energy infrastructure projects\nExpansion of Jordan Oil Refinery Project\nA decision was made to implement an expansion\nto Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC),\nin order to improve the specifications of the\npetroleum products and to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products. Having\nan environmental management system is a\nrequirement from the IFC to grant the JPRC\nloan for expansion. Early 2020, the Refinery\nCompany published a call for services, specifically\nto undertake the planning of an environmental\nmanagement system, that includes environmental\nimpact assessment, environmental audit, health\nand safety and risk assessment. Due to COVID-19,\nthe implementation of this assessment was\ndelayed and accordingly the expansion has been\ndelayed. The expected date of completion for the\nproject is now 2025, instead of 2022.\nConstruction of the Iraqi Crude Oil Pipeline\nDue to the political situation in the region a delay\noccurred in the construction of the Iraqi crude oil\npipeline, which was supposed to transport Iraqi\ncrude oil across Jordanian territory to the export\nterminal in Aqaba with a capacity of 1 million\nbarrels/day, in addition to a branch to supply\nJordan Oil Refinery with 150 thousand barrels/\nday. The date of completion for the construction\nand operation of the pipeline is expected to be\n2027 instead of 2022.\nOil shale surface retorting projects\nAll the companies working in surface retorting\nof oil shale are still unable to fulfill the agreed\nobligations in their production schedules, due to\nchanges in economic feasibility. All the oil shale\ncompanies have been asked to postpone their\nproject development period some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed.\nNuclear Power Plant of 1,000 MW\nIn February 2019, the Ministerial Council took a\ndecision to cancel the construction of the nuclear\npower plant with a proposed capacity of 1,000\nMW, which was planned to be operational and\ncontributing to the electricity system in 2023.\nThis is due to the over committed electricity\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW. The council\ndecided to consider the introduction of smaller\nreactors instead.\nThe third round of the renewable energy projects\nThe decision was taken in the Ministry of Energy\nand Mineral Resources to delay the third round of\nthe renewable energy projects which consists of\nfour 50 MW solar and two 50 MW wind projects\ndue to the decrease in the growth rate of electricity\ndemand, which was 0-1.5% during the period\n2017-2019, and due to the over-committed\ngeneration capacity in terms of MW.\n\n66\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nA.2 The completed infrastructure projects\nMany infrastructure projects, policies, laws and\nbylaws have witnessed successful implementation\nas follows.\nCrude oil and oil products storage\nAll of the strategic projects to increase the storage\ncapacities of crude oil and oil products were\ncompleted on EPC basis and put in operation as\nplanned at the end of 2017, these projects are\nlisted below:\n-\nConstruction of 100 thousand tonnes\nstorage capacity for crude oil in Aqaba,\n-\nConstruction of strategic storage capacities\nfor light oil products with a capacity of\n250-300 thousand tonnes, and 8 thousand\ntonnes for LPG in Almadonah area, in central\nJordan,\n-\nEstablishment of the Oil Logistics Company\nin 2017 to secure the strategic storage\ncapacity of oil and oil products needed for\nthe country.\nElectricity generation and transmission projects\n\nThe new Zarqa Power Plant Project was\ncompleted, with a capacity of 485 MW, at\nthe site of the previous Hussein Power Plant.\nThe plant owned by ACWA Power Company,\noperates mainly on natural gas as primary\nfuel and diesel as secondary fuel. The project\nwas successfully completed and put into\noperation in the year 2019.\n\nThe first electric power plant using coke and\ncoal was completed in Al Karak governorate\nof Jordan, with a generation capacity of 30\nMW. The plant is equipped with the latest\nequipment and technologies in addition\nto the adherence to the internationally\nrecognized environmental standards. The\nplant was put into operation in 2018.\n\nIn mid-2019, the Green Corridor Project\nwas completed and put into operation. The\nproject’s aim is to transmit between 800-1,000\nMW of electricity from renewable energy\nsources, from the south to the load centres\nin other regions in Jordan. This project will\naccommodate electrical power generated\nfrom new renewable energy sources.\nNatural gas projects\nThe construction of the natural gas pipeline in\nthe north of Jordan, designed to import natural\ngas from Nobel Energy Company was completed\nin 2020. The pipeline was constructed according\nto the agreement signed between the National\nPower Company (NEPCO) and Nobel Energy in\n2018.\nRenewable energy projects\nA remarkable achievement in the completion\nof renewable energy projects for electricity\ngeneration has been achieved. All the renewable\nenergy projects listed and considered in the\nbaseline scenario in the FBUR and planned to be\nexecuted by the end of 2019, were completed in\ndue time, as planned.\nBy the end of 2019, 850 MW of solar and 375 MW\nof wind projects were connected to the grid,\nincluding 150 MW net metering projects and\n130 MW wheeling projects.

The Energy Baseline Scenario in the SBUR for\nthe Period 2016-2066\nIn order to build the energy demand and supply\nbaseline scenario in the SBUR, several matters\nand issues which will affect and drive the energy\nscenario will be considered. The most important\nof these are as follows.\nB.1 The over commitment of electricity generation\ncapacity in the country\nThe generation capacity of thermal power plants as\nof the end of September 2019 reached (4,257 MW)\nand while the generation capacity of renewable\nenergy projects (solar and wind) reached (1,130\nMW). Comparatively the maximum peak load for\nthe first half of 2019 was around 3,000 MW.\nThis volume of available generating capacity is\nlarge compared to the maximum peak load and\neven, considering the capacity of conventional\ngeneration stations only, exceeds it by 30%.\n This is in contrast to the internationally recognized\npractices in this industry, which has limits of 10%\n-15%, especially in electrical systems that are\nconnected to electric networks similar to the\nJordanian network. This causes significant costs for\nthe electrical system, since there is a commitment\nto pay for the cost of capacity for the power stations,\n\n69\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\neven if their operation is suspended, according to\nthe Energy Purchase Agreement, which is based on\nthe principle of take or pay. Continuous operation\nof the power stations is not needed as a result of\nthe decline in growth rates in electricity demand\ndue to many reasons, among these:\n\nA high growth rate for the peak load of 6.2%\nannually was adopted in the electrical system\nexpansion planning. However, the actual\ngrowth rate during the three years of (20172019) ranged between (0% - 2%). This was\na result of consumers’ tendency to increase\nthe use of energy-saving technologies, and\nto expand dependence on self-generation\nthrough small and large renewable energy\nprojects, and\n\nEconomic growth decline as a result of\npolitical conditions in the region.\nB.2 The new National Energy Strategy for the\nperiod 2020-2030\nThe Ministry of Energy issued a new energy\nstrategy for the period 2020-2030 and it was\napproved by the Ministerial Council in March 2020\ntogether with a framework implementation plan.\nThe new energy strategy re- estimated the annual\ngrowth rate of the primary energy demand for\nthe period 2020-2030 to be 0.9%, and the annual\ngrowth rate of the electricity demand for the same\nperiod to be 1.1% compared to 2.4% and 4.1% for\nprimary energy demand and electricity demand\nrespectively considered in the previous energy\nstrategy (2015-2025). Table (3.3) illustrate the\ncomparison of the electricity demand in GWh\nbetween the two strategies.\nTable 3.3: Comparison of electricity demand (GWh) within the two energy strategies\nYears\n2020\n2023\n2025\n2030\nEnergy Strategy 2020-2030\n17,672\n17,950\n18,686\n19,701\nEnergy Strategy 2015-2025\n23,150\n26,470\n28,900\n34,990\nThe new strategy aims to achieve energy security\nfor the country and to increase the contribution of\nthe local resources in the energy mix. It also aims\nto decrease the heavy burden of the energy cost\non the national economy and to study the impacts\nof renewable energy projects on the electricity\ngeneration system.\nConsidering the above mentioned issues and facts,\nand according to the previous energy strategy\n2015-2025 and the new energy strategy 2020-2030\nwith their components and the implementation\nplans; the most probable baseline scenario in the\nenergy sector will be based on the adopted goals,\npolicies, and laws, and the planned and committed\nprojects within the energy strategies.\nPolicies, projects and activities considered in the\nbaseline scenario up to 2030 and beyond to 2066\nThe most reliable policies, projects and activities\nconsidered in the baseline scenario up to 2030 and\nbeyond to the year 2066 are summarized in the\nfollowing sections.\nThe Field of Oil and Oil Products\nThe main policy: Securing the needs of the\nKingdom’s crude oil and oil products. Securing the\nKingdom’s oil products needs will be achieved by\nthe following:\n\nJordan Petroleum Refinery will continue to\nproduce 14 thousand tonnes per day (100\nthousand barrels) to meet 60% of the need\nof the domestic market for oil products,\naccording to 2015 statistics. The remainder\nof the needs of the domestic market for oil\nproducts will be imported. This arrangement\nis proposed to last up to 2040.\n\nImplement the expansion of the Jordan\nPetroleum Refinery in order to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products and\nimprove the specifications of petroleum\nproducts. The expansion is planned to be\ncompleted by 2026.\n\n70\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nContinue to meet Jordan’s needs for crude\noil by importing oil from Saudi Arabia by sea,\nthen transporting it in oil tankers to the oil\nrefinery in the centre area of the kingdom.\nThis is planned to continue up to 2027.\n\nConstruction of the Iraqi crude oil pipeline\nto export Iraqi crude oil across Jordanian\nterritory to the export terminal in Aqaba\nwith a capacity of 1 million barrels/day in\naddition to a branch to supply Jordan Oil\nRefinery with 150 thousand barrels/day. The\npipeline is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nThe continuation of the policy of liberalization\nof prices of petroleum products, and pricing\noil products on a monthly basis in accordance\nwith international oil prices. The pricing\npolicy is the most successful mechanism\nand technique to improve the efficiency of\nconsumption.\nThe Field of Natural Gas\nThe main policy: diversifying the natural gas\nresources.\nAfter the completion and construction of LNG\nterminal in Aqaba which went into commercial\noperation in September 2015, Jordan has the\nability to meet all the country’s needs for natural\ngas for electricity generation and for the industrial\nsector.\nCurrently, Jordan imports natural gas by three\nroutes: via the LNG terminal in Aqaba which\nwent into commercial operation in September\n2015, via the Arab Gas Pipeline from Egypt and\nvia pipeline from the Noble Energy Company on\na take or pay basis.\nIn 2019, 86% of the electricity generation of the\nKingdom was based on natural gas imported via\nthe LNG terminal and Egyptian natural gas.\nThe natural gas needed for electricity generation\nduring the period 2016-2022 was estimated to\nbe 350-420 Million Metric Cubic Feet per Day\n(MMcfd). However in the period 2023-2025, the\nquantity will be decreased to 250-350 MMcfd, due\nto the operation of the oil shale power plants.\nThe demand of the industrial sector for natural\ngas is estimated to be 150 MMcfd in the same\nperiod of 2023-2025.\nIn addition, the National Petroleum Company\n(NPC) plans to develop the Risha gas field, in\nJordan, to increase natural gas production\nfrom the site, to 50 MMcfd as a 1st stage. NPC\nhas announced the Risha field as an investment\nopportunity, and is aiming to attract a strategic\npartner for this project.\nIn regard to utilizing waste to generate electricity,\nthe following two projects will be considered:\n- A power plant will be built, which will operate\non direct burning of solid waste, with a\ncapacity of (50 MW) in the Central Area of\nthe Kingdom.\n- A bio–gas power plant will be built, with a\ncapacity of (25 MW), in Ghabawi area, East of\nAmman, , to be operational, in 2022.\nThe Field of Renewable Energy\nThe main policy: utilizing the renewable energy\nresources to generate electricity.\nIn light of the large progress in utilizing the\nrenewable energy resources to generate electricity,\nthe total capacity of the constructed, under\nconstruction and committed projects during the\nperiod 2020-2023 will reach 2400 MW as illustrated\nearlier. Considering the NEPCO situation, the total\nnew capacity of wind and solar energy to be added\nto the system during the period 2024-2030 will be\n600 MW of which 400 MW will be wheeling and\nnet metering systems.\nThe Field of Oil Shale\nThe main policy: utilizing the oil shale resources\nto generate electricity and produce oil.\n\n71\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n Oil shale projects for electricity generation\nDue to the over-committed generating capacity\nin terms of MW, the second direct burning of oil\nshale project for electricity generation will be\nconsidered in the year 2028.\n Oil shale projects for extraction of oil shale\nAll oil shale companies were asked to postpone\nthe development period, and some of the oil shale\ncompanies have closed their businesses. Oil shale\ncompanies that asked for development period\nextension were Jordan Oil Shale Company (JOSCO)\nwhich was intending to produce 20,000 barrels of\noil shale in 2025, Jordan Oil Shale Energy Company\n(JOSE) intending to produce 20,000 barrels/day\nin 2025, Karak International Oil Company (KIO)\nintending to produce 25,000 barrels/day in 2024,\nand Saudi Arabian Corp for Oil Shale (SACOS)\nintending to produce 20,000 barrels/day in 2025.\nThe Field of Nuclear Energy\nConsidering the over committed generating\ncapacity in terms of MW, in the national electric\nsystem, introducing nuclear energy as an\nalternative for electricity generation will be\nconsidered after the year 2030. The Atomic Energy\nCommission is conducting a study to find the best\ntechnology to construct small nuclear reactors in\nseveral locations in Jordan territory, from two to\nsix units with a capacity of 110 MW for each unit.\n3.2.2 Baseline scenario for the transport sector\nA. Sector Policies and Strategies\nA.1 Strategies, policies and plans at the national\nlevel\nTransport in Jordan is the responsibility of the\nMinistry of Transport (MoT) operating under\nTransport Law No. 89, 2003. Jordan’s Long Term\nNational Transport Strategy and Action Plan set\nout the sector policies and strategies. Key policies\ninclude:\n\nImplementing a multi modal approach to\ninclude rail, with good interconnections\nbetween modes, networks and transport\nservices.\n\nProtecting the environment, by increasing\nthe modal share of low-carbon transport\nmodes, and improving energy efficiency by\npromoting innovative technologies.\n\nProviding a greater degree of accessibility,\nparticularly where current provision of public\ntransport services are poor or inadequate.\nBased on these main policies a number of strategies\nwere developed to achieve the goals set out for\nthe sector. These strategies were adapted to form\nfive alternative scenarios. These were prioritized by\nincorporating Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) results\ninto a Multi-Criteria Analysis framework, which\nconsidered impacts of the scenarios over the six\ncriteria: regional, technical, social, policy, economic\nand financial and environmental.\nThe chosen scenario was the scenario termed\nthe “Environmental Option”. This scenario was\nbuilt (within the strategy) selecting measures\naimed at reducing the impacts of the transport\nsector on the environment (i.e. emissions, effects\nof climate change, noise and land use). In the\n‘Environmental’ Scenario public transport was\ngiven a high priority, with strategies aimed\nat shifting modal shares from private to mass\ntransit. These included improvement of networks,\nincluding the implementation of the Hejaz railway\nalong its entire route from Aqaba to the Syrian\nborder and also setting minimum safety and\nquality standards for public transport vehicles.\nConcerning the road sector, the included strategies\nplaced higher importance on maintenance and\nsafety-enhancing measures for the existing\nnetwork, rather than extensive road-building.\nFurther strategies concerned minimum safety\nand emissions standards for freight vehicles.\nNational Climate Change Policy\nOne of the key national policies that tackled the\nTransport sector was the National Climate Change\nPolicy for Jordan 2013-2020. For the transport\nsector, the policy identified the following strategic\nclimate change objectives:\n\n72\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nTo integrate climate change mitigation\nobjectives and the impact of GHG emissions\ninto transport policies, strategies and action\nplans,\n\nTo promote use of energy efficient, low carbon\ntechnologies, and increase understanding of\ntheir mitigation impact,\n\nTo promote low carbon energy efficient\nmodes of transport.\nThe report also recommended measures to\nachieve the afore-mentioned objectives:\n\nDeveloping\nand\nstrengthening\nlocal\ncapacities in assessment of different transport\nmodes and their mitigation effect,\n\nImproving data collection related to activity\ndata, emissions and emissions factors,\n\nDeveloping Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs).\nIntended Nationally Determined Contributions\n(INDCs)\nIn 2016, Jordan submitted its INDCs to the\nUNFCCC  with the objective of reducing its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. This INDCs Action\nPlan was formally approved by Jordan in August\n2019. The INDCs include mitigation projects for\nthe transport sector including: implementing\na railway system, implementing the bus rapid\ntransit (BRT) nationally, provision of electric car\ncharging stations powered by renewable energy\nand ensuring the inclusion of energy efficiency\nconsiderations in purchase of vehicles. The aim of\nthese projects is to increase the total number of\ncommuters using public transport and reduce total\nvehicle kilometers travelled, fuel consumption,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants\n(More details can be found in Appendix B)\nHighway Master Plan\nThe Ministry of Public Works and Housing\n(MoPWH) carried out its Highway Master Plan\nStudy in 2011. This study provided a timephased road sector development plan up\nto 2030, recommending roads and bridges\nin need of recovery maintenance, including\nimplementation of identified safety measures,\nthe major task identified was the rehabilitation\nof the Desert Highway. Several highways were\nalso recommended for road widening to ease\ncongestion. The study suggested that the\nnetwork was sufficient, but recommended the\nimplementation of a ring road for Amman.\nA.2 Strategies, policies and plans at the subnational level (within GAM)\nAs for Amman city, GAM’s planning document is\nthe 2010 Transport Mobility Master Plan (TMMP),\nwhich has been designed to guide development\nof the transport system within GAM up to 2025.\nThe transport policies developed by GAM in the\nTMMP were based on providing a public Transport\n(PT) system which is accessible and affordable to\nall and encouraging a variety of mobility options\nwhile promoting public transport and walking.\nGAM strategies were developed related to public\ntransport, road safety, pedestrian environment,\nparking, freight, intelligent transport systems (ITS),\ndemand management and the road network.\nStrategies were also developed for the Downtown\nof Amman.\nIn the TMMP twelve scenarios were developed.\nThese scenarios were basically based on the level\nof public transport to be provided (regular bus,\nBRT, light rail) combined with a range of demand\nmanagement measures (soft, medium and\nhard). For GAM the preferred scenario included\nsubstantial investment in high quality public\ntransport services, i.e. bus rapid transit (BRT)\nand light rail, but combined with soft demand\nmanagement.\nTransport and mobility projects have also\nbeen developed within Amman in documents\nseeking to encourage the city’s development in a\nsustainable and environmentally friendly manner.\nThese include:\n\n73\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAmman Resilience Strategy\nThis was developed with the guidance of the\nRockefeller Institute’s 100 resilient cities. As well\nas projects for an integrated mobility plan, BRT\nand metro. The report developed the following\nprojects:\n\nDevelop an urban mobility observatory,\nto enable a data-driven decision-making\napproach,\n\nDevelop, review and update Amman’s street\nmanual to provide guidance to city planners\nto design safe, high standard streets that\nprovide universal and inclusive accessibility\nand promote a walkable environment,\n\nCreate a walking map to show routes between\nneighborhoods,\n\nExplore tactical urbanism opportunities\ni.e. creating opportunities for youth to\nparticipate in the redesign of spaces and\ntemporarily reclaim spaces designated to\ncars,\n\nOrganize a design competition for the area\naround Amman’s Hejaz Railway, to increase\naccess to green spaces in the city.\nAmman Climate Plan, a Vision for 2050\nThis vision document, which was developed\nwith the assistance of the World Bank, sets out a\nseries of projects for transport and mobility. These\ninclude expansion of several of GAM’s projects\nincluding more lanes of BRT, purchasing more\nelectric vehicles to replace vehicles owned by\nGAM and taxis and providing buses with improved\nfuel specifications. In addition, they recommend\nenhancing the efficiency of the city bus network,\nto be addressed as part of the Feeder project.\nAdditionally, the plan recommends the following\nprojects, many of which could be achieved in the\nshort term:\n\nImplementation of a public transportation\nawareness plan to change perceptions and\nbehavior,\n\nCoordination of transit-oriented planning\nwith the planning and transportation\ndepartments,\n\nInstallation of electric vehicle charging\nstations around the city,\n\nImplementation of benefits for zero/low\nemission vehicles, including fast lanes,\nparking discounts, and reduced fees,\n\nInstalling bike paths and other bike safety\nmeasures.\nThe vision document also recommends the\nimprovement of walkability through:\n\nInstallation of new sidewalks,\n\nMaintenance and improvement of existing\nsidewalks,\n\nIncreased green space and tree cover,\n\nIntroduction of pedestrian safety measures.\nGreen City Action Plan\nThis project was launched in 2017 between EBRD\nand GAM to promote sector reforms and develop\npriority projects to modernise infrastructure and\nmunicipal services in Amman.\nThe report is still under development, but it will\nrecommend projects based on the strategic\nobjectives of:\n\nIncreasing the modal share of public\ntransportation,\n\nDeveloping a public realm strategy that\nsupports\npedestrian\ntravel,\n\nIncorporating smart systems in transport\nplanning.\nB. Key Committed Projects\nAmman Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Amman\nZarqa BRT: In these projects, which are currently\nunder construction, buses will be operated in their\nown dedicated lanes. The two systems will be\noperated as one integrated system and will form\nan important backbone for transport in the area.\n\n74\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nThe Amman BRT project will be supported by a\nstudy, to be implemented by GAM, concerning\npublic transport in the area of the Amman BRT.\nThe aim of this study is to advise how to rearrange\nand supplement current public transport services\nin order to support and make ‘best use’ of the\nBRT, by providing ‘feeder’ services to provide\naccess from neighborhoods to BRT stations.\nPotential benefits of these combined projects\nare to improve the image of public transport and\nencourage a mode shift from private vehicles to\nBRT and public transport in general. This mode\nshift from private vehicles to public transport, is\nexpected to produce a reduction in congestion,\nfuel use and emissions of greenhouse gases and\nother pollutants.\n The fuel type of the buses to be purchased is\nstill under consideration. The minimum standard,\nwould be diesel Euro V or Euro VI, but electric\nbuses are still under consideration.\nThe reorganization of the current public transport\nsystem for Amman based on the Feeder Study is\nexpected to lead to a greater number of services\nbeing operated by new BRT buses. This would\nlead to a decrease in emissions, however is not\npossible to estimate the emissions savings until\nreorganization of public transport networks has\nbeen agreed.\nProposed Update of TMMP: A comprehensive\nlist of proposed projects is laid out in the TMMP\nto support the strategies identified by GAM for\ntransport in the city. However, it is considered\nthat the next step for GAM should be to carry\nout an update of the TMMP, since the previous\nstudy is now 10 years old and there have been\nconsiderable changes in the city, in particular a\nlarge growth in population. This would enable the\npolicies and strategies to be set out for mobility in\nGAM for the next 15 years, with the aim of guiding\nAmman city into development while considering\nenergy efficiency and sustainability. One of the\nexpected outcomes of the project is a roadmap\nfor future growth in mobility in GAM with clear\npriorities given to proposed projects.\nThe Data Warehouse Project: this project is\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, with the\npurpose of collecting, storing, processing and\ndistribution of data concerning the transport\nsector. This should motivate the use of data by\ndecision makers at all levels. Potential benefits\ninclude the use of trends analysis to make\nestimates for the future and use of previous\nexperience in future planning.\nPublic Transport Restructuring Project for\nGovernorates: Projects are planned to restructure\nthe urban public transport systems of Irbid, Zarqa\nand Madaba with the aim of developing reliable\npublic transport systems and improving the level\nof services for citizens. Potential benefits are to\npromote a mode shift to public transport trips,\nfrom private vehicle trips, with a subsequent\nreduction in congestion, fuel use and emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants.\nIntelligent Transport Systems Project (ITS): The\naim of this project is to develop and operate ITS\nto monitor and control public transport services,\nand to provide an integrated electronic payment\nsystem. This has been implemented in GAM as\na pilot project with the new buses for Amman\nVision introduced in 2019. Potential benefit is\nin adding convenience for passengers, helping\nto promote mode shift from private vehicles to\npublic transport.\nAmman, Salt and Irbid Ring Roads: Salt and\nIrbid ring roads are currently under construction.\nAmman ring road, Phase 1, also known as Amman\nDevelopment Corridor is already completed.\nFeasibility and Environmental Studies, as well as\ndetailed designs have been carried out for the\nremaining sections. Potential benefits of these\nprojects are to relieving traffic congestion in the\ncities, particularly from truck traffic and improve\naccess to areas on the outskirts of the city.\n\n75\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nAirport Projects: Air travel connections to\nJordan are vital to Jordan’s economic growth.\nProjects have been proposed to accommodate\nin future increasing passenger numbers,\nthrough expansion at Amman Civil Airport and\nKing Hussein International Airport in Aqaba.\nImplementation of a further airport has also been\nsuggested. Potential benefits of these projects are\npredominantly economic, but are also important\nfor accessibility.\nProjects concerning freight: In order to\nevaluate the GHG mitigation effect of freight\nprojects, concerning use of different modes\nof transportation, emissions factors from the\ndifferent modes published by Department of the\nEnvironment, Fisheries & Rural Affairs (Defra), UK\nhave been compared. The lowest emissions from\nfreight transport are for cargo ship, followed by\nfreight rail services, and therefore these would\nbe the best options for freight to and within the\ncountry. Transporting freight by air, either within\nthe country or into the country has the largest\nemissions factors, and therefore road freight is\nto be preferred to air freight.\nASEZA Rail Freight Project: Feasibility and\ntechnical studies are being undertaken for the\ndevelopment of a railway connecting a planned\nland port at Ma’an with port facilities around\nAqaba. Potential benefits are to encourage mode\nshift for freight between Aqaba and Ma’an from\nroad to rail, leading to a reduction in congestion,\nand emissions of greenhouse gases and other\npollutants.\nMoT National Railway Project: The aim is to\nestablish a freight railway network. The railway\nbetween Aqaba and Ma’an forms the first part\nof this plan. The remainder of the project is still\nin need of funding. Potential benefits are to\nencourage mode shift for freight around the\ncountry and to/from neighboring countries from\ntrucks to railway with an expected reduction in\ncongestion and emissions from greenhouse gases\nand other pollutants.\nC. Future Trends in Transport Sector\nIn the short term (around 5 years) there are\nmany projects being implemented, which will\nhave a large effect on transport in Jordan. The\nBRT network for Amman and between Zarqa and\nAmman should be operational in 2021, with a\nmodern comfortable bus fleet. The reorganization\nand restructuring of public transport services in\nAmman, Zarqa, Irbid and Madaba, should also\nhave been carried out, with implementation of ITS\ntechnology on all buses. Additionally, walkability\nin Amman is already being improved, with the\nrehabilitation of areas along the BRT lines currently\nunder construction by GAM.\nThese projects and improvements are expected\nto encourage a mode shift in trips from private\nvehicles to public transport as it is made more\nconvenient and comfortable. This is expected to\nlead to a reduction in congestion and a decrease\nin fuel use, with a corresponding drop in emissions\nof greenhouse gases and other pollutants. These\nprojects may additionally be copied by other\ngovernorates and within Amman, where there is\npotential for further lines of BRT and improvements\nin walking infrastructure. The data warehouse\ncurrently being implemented by MoT, would be\na source of data and information concerning all\ntransport projects, which could be made available\nto interested organisations.\nThe MoPWH is expected to have completed\nnecessary rehabilitation of the Desert Highway,\nand carried out widening and rehabilitation of\nroads, as identified in the 2011 Highways Master\nPlan. This would lead to improved journey times\nand reduced congestion, which would lead\nto more efficient operations for road freight\ntransport.\nGAM’s TMMP Update Project should have been\ncompleted\nproviding\nimportant\nguidance\nconcerning the priority for projects in the transport\nsector within the city.\nIt is expected to have more electric cars on the\nroads of Amman, purchased by GAM and by the\npublic, as they are shown to be efficient for city-\n\n76\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nuse and as fuel stations and destinations in the\ncity provide more charging stations.\nIn the medium term (around 10 years) larger\ninfrastructure projects committed by the\nGovernment of Jordan should have been\nimplemented. These are expected to include the\npipeline project between Jordan and Iraq and the\nrailway project between Aqaba and Ma’an. These\ntwo projects would remove a large number of\ntruck vehicle kms from the network, since trips\nby oil trucks to Zarqa from Amman and Iraq, and\ntrips by freight lorries between Amman and Aqaba\nare expected to be largely replaced by trips by\npipeline or rail.\nWork on Amman Civil Airport and King Hussein\nInternational Airport, are expected to have been\ncompleted, allowing greater passenger trips and\nboosting tourist numbers and economic growth\nin the country.\nRing roads around Amman, Salt and Irbid should\nhave been completed, improving accessibility for\nareas around these cities and reducing congestion\nin the city centres. Stronger legislation will have\nbeen possible for trucks to keep them out of the\nurban areas of these cities, now suitable alternative\nroutes have been provided, reducing congestion,\nGHG emissions and emissions of other pollutants.\nKey projects for the longer term include the\nNational Rail Network, which would connect with\nthe railway from Aqaba at Ma’an. This is expected\nto carry a large proportion of the freight across\nJordan, which would provide savings in terms of\nreducing Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) on the\nroad network, with a reduction in congestion, fuel\nuse, GHG emissions and other pollutants. Metro\nfor Amman could also have been implemented.\nAdditionally, it is expected to have projects for\nGAM, as prioritized through the TMMP Update\nproject. Potentially these could include a tram for\nDowntown Amman, and light rail from Amman\nto Queen Alia International Airport.\n3.2.3 Baseline scenario for the industrial\nprocess sector\nIndustry is a significant contributor to Jordan’s\nGDP, directly contributing about 24% to the\nnational Gross Domestic Product (GDP), during\n2017.\nIndustry in Jordan is divided into two main types;\nmanufacturing sector, including the production\nof cement, lime, fertilizers and chemicals, and the\nmining and quarrying sector, including quarrying\nof limestone.\nJordan’s industrial sector is increasingly affected by\nregional circumstances; exports to Iraq and Syria\ndecreased because of the increasing difficulties of\ntransportation and trade across the north-eastern\nand northern borders and the land routes to the\nMediterranean. Moreover, the industrial sector is\nfacing new challenges due to COVID-19 pandemic\nin 2020, i.e. Cement production has decreased due\nto Lockdown, and particularly periods of curfew\nthat have slowed down operations significantly.\nThe government has focused on developing\nthe industrial sector, through attracting foreign\ninvestment, privatization of public establishments\nand providing customs and tax exemptions\nfor investment projects within the different\nsectors, particularly the mining sector. However,\nGovernment policies should take into account the\nafore-mentioned industry circumstances.\nThere are laws and regulations that encourage\nand protect the capital investment such as Jordan\nInvestment Law No. 30 of 2014. However, current\nJordanian laws and regulations do not directly\ncontrol CO2 and other GHG emissions from\nindustrial processes. For example, the Jordanian\nlegally binding standards (JS 1189/2006)\nconcerning the quantity and quality of emissions\nfrom stationary sources such as the industrial\nprocesses has no specific threshold value for CO2\nand GHG emissions.\nThe following are the governmental policies,\nstrategies and plans relevant to the industrial\nsector:\n\n77\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe Ministry of Industry Trade and Supply\ndeveloped an industrial policy (2017 – 2021)\nto enhance the competitiveness of the\nindustrial sector, increase its contribution to\neconomic development, enable it to increase\nits exports to traditional and new markets,\nand increase the investment through an\neffective partnership with the private sector,\n\nJordan Economic Growth Plan (2018-2021)\nincludes the establishment of a fund to\nsupport and finance industrial development\nin order to finance projects resulting from the\nindustrial policy, reduce the operational costs\non the industrial sector through motivating\nthe use of alternative energy sources,\nproviding technical and financial support\nto industrial companies, and developing\ninfrastructure and regulatory procedures for\nthe transport sector in all modes serving the\nindustrial activities,\n\nThe National Renaissance Plan (2019-2020)\nsingled out a major thrust for the state of\nproduction which includes a number of\nnational priorities and projects related to the\nindustry and commerce sectors and small\nand medium enterprises. These priorities and\nprojects aim to increase productivity, increase\ngrowth in Jordan’s economy and generate\ndecent job opportunities for Jordanians,\n\nBylaw No. 13/2020 includes a set of standards\nand criteria that must be achieved for the\nindustrial sector, including supporting the\ndevelopment of this sector, increasing its\ncompetitiveness in foreign markets and\nproviding job opportunities for Jordanians.\nListed below are the main plans/activities of\nthe government to improve the industrial\nperformance of Jordan:\n\nEnhance the competitiveness of the industrial\nsector and increase its export potential to\ntraditional and new markets,\n\nImproving the quality of local products and\nadapting them to international specifications.\n\nProviding job opportunities for all Jordanians,\nincluding female workers and people with\ndisabilities,\n\nIncrease confidence in the industrial sector\nand support the development of this sector\nto effectively contribute to economic\ndevelopment of the country,\n\nAllow the lease of treasury lands in the\ngovernorates for the purpose of establishing\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by the\ngovernorates citizens, according to specific\ncontrols and standards,\n\nReduce the operational costs of the\nindustrial sector through motivating the\nuse of alternative energy sources, providing\ntechnical and financial support to industrial\ncompanies, and developing infrastructure\nand regulatory procedures for the transport\nsector for all modes serving industrial\nactivities,\n\nImprove the investment environment, in\norder to attract foreign investments to all\nthe governorates,\n\nImprove the required infrastructure of\nservices needed for industrial activities,\n\nReduce the gap between the output of\neducation and vocational training and the\nneeds of the labor market and provide the\nnecessary support, in order to build the\ncapacities of workers in the industrial sector,\n\nEnhance the communication between\ntechnical research and development entities\nand industries in order to improve knowledge\nconcerning\nuse\nof\nnew\ntechniques/\ntechnologies,\n\nEnhance the adoption of Best Available\nTechnology (BAT) and Best Environmental\nPractices (BEP) in the industrial processes,\n\nImprove regulations and policies in order to\nencourage industrial investment,\n\nEnhance cooperation between the private\nand public sectors,\n\n78\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nEstablish a national strategy to improve the\nexport of local products to the international\nmarket,\n\nImprove the financial support mechanism\nto incentivise industrial investments,\n\nProvide technical support to the industries\nin order to comply with technical and\nenvironmental standards and enhance\ntheir participation in setting standards and\ndecision-making.\n3.2.4 Baseline scenario for the waste sector\nJordan is shifting towards more sustainable\nsolid waste management systems and trying to\nintroduce more innovative options to tackle the\nchallenge of solid waste management, especially\nwith the high pressure exerted on its system with\nthe flux of refugees as a result of the Syrian crisis\nin recent years. Efforts made by the Ministry of\nEnvironment resulted in the adoption of The Solid\nWaste Framework Law, which aims at producing\ngood governance in the waste sector. The Ministry\nof Local Administration also adopted the National\nStrategy in 2015, which diagnoses most of the\nproblems the waste management system suffers\nfrom. Some of the problems and weaknesses\nidentified by the strategy are: low operational\nefficiency of municipalities and Joint Services\nCouncils, lack of information, low sanitation level\nat landfills (except Ghabawi), low level of recycling,\nfew projects for waste to energy and composting\nactivities.\nThe new solid waste management framework\nlaw which came into force in September 2020\nwill organise the solid waste sector in Jordan for\nthe coming years and will provide the basis for\nbetter solid waste management.\nThe per capita solid waste generation rate is\ncurrently around 1kg/capita/day for urban areas\nin Jordan and is expected to continue increasing\nin the coming years with urbanization, reduction\nof family size and with increase in income. Waste\nin rural areas will mostly continue to increase but\nat a higher rate than in urban areas.\nFunds from international agencies contributed\nto upgrading the solid waste infrastructure. The\nupgrade in solid waste infrastructure such as\nintroduction of more solid waste transfer stations\nwill improve the system capacity and will also\nimprove the financial situation of municipalities\nespecially medium and large ones.\nAlso,\nsome\ndonors\nhave\nstarted\nwaste\nmanagement programs such as waste sorting\nfacilities and composting at some landfills and\nwithin refugees camps. The unstable recyclables\nmarket still hinders the sustainability of the waste\nreduction and recycling programs as they still do\nnot meet their monetary- economic feasibility.\nComposting will continue to be unfeasible unless\nit is adopted as governmental policy for waste\nreduction.\nPrivate Public Partnership (PPP) in solid waste\nactivities in Jordan is still weak and needs to be\nimproved even though there are some good\nexamples in Aqaba, Zarqa, and Petra. Awareness\nof public and vocational training of solid waste\nworkers still needs to be improved more with\nfocus on introducing key performance indicators\nfor waste collection systems and workers at\nmunicipality level. Improvements expected in\nsolid waste management will not be sustainable\nunless an information management system is\nadopted at all levels.\nThe economic success along with good\ngovernance in solid waste management are the\nmost important. It is also important to achieve\ndecoupling between GDP and waste generation\nwhich is not an easy task. Success in decoupling\nis ensured by effective awareness raising, waste\nreduction programs, waste recycling and reuse\nand application of resource efficiency and cleaner\nproduction principles in industry.\nClimate change is expected to impact both waste\ngeneration rate and waste decomposition rate.\nReduced cloud cover, as one of the climate change\nfeatures, adversely impacts the life of exposed\nmaterial resulting in more waste generation.\nIn general, the rate of population growth in Jordan\nhas been declining since the 1950’s except during\n\n79\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nexceptional circumstances, such as the Gulf War,\nwhere population increased by 10.3% and 6.72% in\n1990 and 1991 respectively. The strategy suggests\nthat the decrease in population growth rate will\ncontinue and may reach around 1.26 % in 2040.\nIn reality, the growth rate will not continue to\ndecrease, but would reach a fixed value of around\n2.1% as the growth rate of population is greatly\naffected by religious belief, social circumstances\nand economic situation. As such, the solid waste\nquantities generated will continue to increase, but\nwith a lower rate if only dependent on population\nincrease, and disregarding other factors. This is in\nline with the assumption of the national strategy\nthat assumes a 2.04% increase rate for urban areas\nand 1.02 % increase rate for rural areas. According\nto the strategy, by 2039 solid waste from urban\nareas will reach 1.64 and from rural areas 1.112\nkg/capita/day.\nHowever, in reality the waste generated per\ncapita is not expected to continue increasing\nand it should reach some stagnant point (noting\nthat Jordan is an upper middle income country\naccording to World Bank classification and is not\nexpected to become a high income country in\nthe foreseeable future).\nWaste composition is an important aspect for\nsuccessful environmental policies and good\nwaste management programs. Many solid waste\ncomposition studies have been performed\nin Jordan at different levels, most of them to\nanalyse waste received at landfills and others\nbased on samples at initial disposal points. It can\nbe concluded from all the studies that organic\nwaste seems to be the main component of the\nmunicipal solid waste, in addition to packaging\nwaste, which seems to be significant mostly in\nurban areas. Waste composition is not fixed and\ncould be changed based on different limiting\nfactors such as socioeconomic conditions,\nurbanization, etc. As Jordan accepts waves of\nrefugees from nearby countries, these incoming\npeople may have different social behaviors that\naffect waste composition at country level, but no\nspecific studies have been conducted to study\nthis impact. Also, unforeseen events affect waste\ncomposition, such as the current COVID 19 crisis\nwhich immediately resulted in an increase in\nplastic waste in the form of gloves and masks.\nBut this crisis may result in permanent changes in\nwaste composition such as increasing packaging\nwaste as a result of a change in social behavior,\nas people start ordering more online products.\nIn conclusion, waste quantities will continue to\nincrease with time in Jordan in the short and\nmedium term. To reach decoupling between\nwaste generation and economic growth, robust\npolicies need to be applied. Waste composition\nwill continue to change as the urbanization rate\nincreases, family size decreases, GDP increases and\nbased on other related factors.\n3.2.5 Baseline scenario for the AFOLU sector\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nis unique among all sectors, since its mitigation\npotential is based on both an enhancement of\nremovals of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as\nreduction of emissions through management\nof land and livestock. The AFOLU sector is\nresponsible for around a quarter of the annual\nGHG emissions resulting mainly from deforestation\nand agricultural emissions from livestock, soil\nand nutrient management. Opportunities for\nmitigation include both the supply-side and\ndemand side options as well as forests which are\nconsidered important carbon pools.\nPolicies governing practices in agriculture and\nin forest conservation and management need\nto account for both mitigation and adaptation.\nAnthropogenic\nland-use\nactivities\n(e.g.,\nmanagement of croplands, forests, grasslands,\nwetlands), and changes in land use/cover (e.g.,\nconversion of forest lands and grasslands to\ncropland and pasture, afforestation) cause\nchanges superimposed on natural carbon fluxes.\nLand is the critical resource for the AFOLU sector.\nIt provides food and fodder and it provides\nlivelihoods for people. Human economies and\nquality of life are directly dependent on the\nservices and the resources provided by land.\n\n80\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nIn Jordan, the natural ecosystems support human\nactivities in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,\ntourism, traditional and pharmaceutical health\nproducts, and traditional medicine, among others.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, less than\n5% of the country’s total area is arable land and\n90% is grazing land with 100-200 mm annual\nrainfall. Natural and human-made forests cover\naround 1% of the country’s area. The contribution\nof agriculture to the GDP in relative terms declined\nsharply from 40% in the 1950s to 4% in 2016.\nIrrespective of how humble the contribution of\nagriculture is to GDP and economic performance,\nfarming remains important. The importance of\nthe agricultural sector stems from the fact that\nit is not only a major source of food, particularly\ndairy products, fruits and vegetables, but it is also\na source of livelihood for 25% of the total poor\npopulation (livestock keepers, smallholder farm\nhouseholds, and landless former agriculturalists)\nliving in rural areas.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)\nstatistics 11% of the total country area is used\nas agriculture land and less than 1 % is forests\n(MoA, Annual Report, 2018). The country has three\ndistinguished bioclimatic zones namely:\n\nThe Jordan Valley, which forms a narrow strip\nthat is situated below the mean sea level with\nwarm winters and hot summers and where\nirrigation is practiced,\n\nThe western highlands, where annual\nprecipitation is in the range of 300 to 600\nmm,\n\nThe “Badia”, which includes the arid and semiarid areas in the eastern parts of the country,\nwhere the annual rainfall is below 200 mm.\nBadia is an Arabic word describing the open\nrangeland inhibited by Bedouins (nomads).\nAvailable governmental plans, programs, policies,\nand strategies announced and published by the\nMinistry of Agriculture, the Directorate of Forests,\nand other relevant institutions were reviewed.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture has just recently\npublished the 2020-2025 National Agricultural\nDevelopment Strategy focusing on the digitization\nand restructuring of the sector and boosting its\nproductivity.\nThe strategy identified a total of 174 interventions\nand projects that will be financed through a host\nof channels, including the Treasury; from the\nAgricultural Credit Corporation and from foreign\naid and grants.\nThe strategy has the following ambitious\nobjectives:\n\nIncreasing the agricultural GDP as a share\nof total GDP from 2.6 billion JD now to 3.66\nbillion JD by 2025 and boosting the addedvalue of agriculture to 2.48 billion JD from\n1.6 billion JD,\n\nIncreasing the forest area by 10% by 2025,\n\nExpanding pasture areas,\n\nCreating 65,000 jobs in the five-year period\nand replacing 21,000 foreign workers with\nJordanians,\n\nIncrease the number of farmers using digital\ngovernment-run agricultural services by 30\nper cent,\n\nReducing export costs to facilitate a 15 per\ncent increase in agricultural exports,\n\nIncrease the productivity of food and\nagricultural manufacturers by 18 per cent\nby 2025,\n\nThe utilization of modern technology to\nenhance production and productivity,\nfocusing on strategic crops,\nThe policy will address, as well, a number of\nchallenges facing the agricultural sector, among\nwhich:\n\nThe lack of comprehensive agricultural\ndatabases and poor utilization of modern\ntechnologies in agriculture that limited the\nagricultural producer’s access to retailers and\nconsumers,\n\n81\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nMarketing of products with the closure\nof neighboring markets due to regional\nconditions and the need to facilitate export\nof agricultural products through the Queen\nAlia International Airport (QAIA), \n\nLack of refrigerator trucks to transport fruit\nand vegetables ready for exporting,\n\nCompensating farmers for the damage to\ncrops because of frost,\n\nThe high cost of electricity for the agricultural\nsector,\n\nThe need to better manage the issue of nonJordanian workers in the sector, \n\nThe need to support livestock breeders with\nfeed, medicine and vaccines,\n\nIncrease in fodder prices due to delay and\ndecrease of rainfall.\nConsistent with these plans, the following is\nprojected as the baseline for AFOLU:\n\nField crops production: Increase productivity\nper unit area, promote water harvesting\ntechniques to expand planting areas, and\nmaintain productivity under predicted\ndecrease in rainfall,\n\nAnimal production: Promote high productive\nanimal species, under increase in prices of\nfodder, and other production inputs\n\nFodder\nproduction:\nReclamation\nof\nrangelands and control of overgrazing of\nrangelands, introduce species with high\nproductivity under drought conditions\nand promote wastewater reuse in fodder\nproduction,\n\nForestry conservation: Maintain forests which\nare threatened by predicted drought cycles,\nurban and rural expansion, expected fire\noccurrences, and illegal deforestation.\n3.3 Updates on the FBUR Mitigation Measures\nfor Different Sectors\nAccording to Annex III of Decision 2/CP.17 related to\nthe guidelines for the preparation of national BURs,\nnon-annex I parties should provide information,\nin a tabular format, on actions to mitigate climate\nchange, by addressing anthropogenic emissions\nby sources and removals by sinks of all GHGs not\ncontrolled by the Montreal Protocol.\nIn the preparation of this chapter of Jordan’s SBUR,\nall mitigation projects included in the FBUR have\nbeen reviewed and assessed to identify those\noptions considered to be still valid and applicable.\nThe cost-benefit analysis and the CO2 emissions\nreduction have been updated for each valid\nmitigation project. Net present value was used\nin the financial calculations, by converting all\npresent and future revenues and costs over the\nlifetime of the project to a base of today’s cost.\nThe same approach was followed in calculating\nCO2 emissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nproposed projects. A discount rate of 8% was used\nin all calculations of cost and emissions reduction.\nThe discounted unit cost of reduced emissions\nwhich is the quotient of the discounted cost to\nthe discounted emissions reduction was also\ncalculated.\nThe updated mitigation measures include GHG\nmitigation projects in the following areas:\n\nPrimary energy,\n\nRenewable energy,\n\nEnergy efficiency,\n\nIndustrial processes,\n\nWaste,\n\nAgriculture and forestry.\nThe results of the mitigation measures update is\npresented in the following sub-sections.\n3.3.1 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor primary energy\nThe GHG mitigation measures in the primary\nenergy demand and supply that were considered\nin the FBUR have been reviewed and assessed.\nAll information is presented in a tabular format\nin Appendix A, Table A.1. Table 3.4 is a summary\nof the FBUR mitigation projects and their current\nstatus.\n\n82\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.4: Status of the primary energy mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution Network\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nDemand Side Management\nCanceled from NEPCO’s implementation plan\nsince the different components of the project\nwill be implemented by JREEEF/MEMR through\nits Action Plan.\nAdding a 100 MW Combined Cycle in Samra\nPower Plant\nImplemented. It was modified to 70 MW instead\nof 100 MW and completely implemented by the\nyear 2018. According to the modification, the\ntotal estimated GHG emission reduction is 2066\nthousand tonnes CO2eq (kt CO2eq) during 25\nyears from 2018- 2043. The estimated emission\nreduction unit cost is - 33.77 JD/tonne of CO2eq.\nThus, the following two primary energy projects\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. The two mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution (T&D) Network, This project seeks\nto reduce the transmission and distribution\nlosses to 9% in 2027 compared to 13.3% in\n2020. The project will be executed gradually\nover a period of 6 years starting in 2022.\nThe main components of the project will\nbe optimizing the utilization of distributed\ngeneration, improving the system power\nfactor, upgrading or replacing existing\nconductors and insulators with lowerresistance equipment. The cost is estimated\nto be 48 Million USD. This project can lead to a\nsignificant reduction in fuel consumption and\nas a result a discounted emission reduction\nof 1,956 thousand tonnes of CO2 through the\n25 years, lifetime of the project (2022-2047),\n\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa, and Aqaba, According to the energy\nstrategy 2020-2030, Jordan will enhance\nthe usage of natural gas in all sectors such\nas Industrial, Residential, Commercial and\nTransportation. This includes the use of natural\ngas instead of liquefied petroleum gas for\ncooking, diesel in central heating and water\nheating and gasoline for cars. In 2020, 86%\nof the electricity generation of the Kingdom\nis generated from imported natural gas. To\ndeliver natural gas to smaller customers it will\nbe necessary to construct new low-pressure\ngas distribution networks to connect\ncustomers to the new infrastructure.\n The project will be executed gradually over\n10 years, starting in 2025 and with a capital\ncost of 110 million USD.\n Natural gas combustion emits 1.3 times less\nCO2 than that of oil, which indicates that\nusing natural gas in demand side sector as an\nalternative for diesel, fuel oil, LPG and gasoline,\nwill mitigate a significant quantity of CO2\nemissions. Using the natural gas distribution\nnetworks in the main cities of Amman, Zarqa,\nand Aqaba will mitigate about 2,708 thousand\ntonnes of CO2eq discounted emissions in the\n25 years of the project lifetime (2025-2050).\n The costs and CO2 emissions reduction for the\ntwo valid projects have been analyzed. Table\n3.5 shows a summary of the results.\n\n83\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nTable 3.5: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne CO2eq) for the\nprimary energy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emission reductions\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission\nand Distribution Network\n1,956\n- 108.52\nNatural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba\n2,708\n-13.78\n3.3.2 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor renewable energy (RE)\nRenewable energy (RE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed. All information is presented\nin a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.2. Table\n3.6 is a summary of their current status.\nTable 3.6: Status of RE mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. This project is\npostponed due to over commitment in the electricity\ncapacity in terms of MW in the system and the decline\nin the electricity demand growth rate.\nSolar Water Heaters 2-30,000 Houses\nImplemented in four stages by JREEEF/MEMR during\nthe period 2017-2020.\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. Postponed to\nstart in the year 2022 instead of 2020.\n120 MW PV – Wheeling and Net Metering\nImplemented by MEMR during the period 2017-2020.\nThus, the following three renewable energy\nprojects are still valid and moved from FBUR to\nbe updated and considered in this SBUR. The three\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nConcentrating solar power (CSP) systems\nwork by concentrating the sun’s rays using\nmirrors to create heat, then the created heat\nis transferred to a heat transfer fluid. Electricity\nis then generated in a steam cycle, using the\nheat transfer fluid to create steam and generate\nelectricity as in conventional thermal power\nplants.\nConcentrated solar plants today typically include\nlow-cost thermal storage systems to decouple\ngeneration from the sun. Most commonly, a twotank molten salt storage system is used. CSP\nsystems are classified into line concentrating\nand focal concentrating systems referring to\nthe arrangements of concentrating mirrors.\nThe most widely deployed linear concentrating\nsystems are parabolic trough collectors while\nsolar towers are the most widely deployed focal\n\n84\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nconcentrating systems. It is expected that the\nconcentrated technology will play a major role\nin producing electricity with an increasing use\nof thermal storage to utilize excess heat during\nnight time to ensure the continuity of power\nproduction.\nThe capital cost of CSP represented by the\nunit cost of kW is decreasing with time. The\nreported global weighted- average cost of\nCSP commissioned in 2019 was USD 5,774/\nkW which is 36% lower than in 2010. Also,\nthe capacity factor increased to reach 45% in\n2019 with storage capacities from 4 to 8 hours.\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) costs that\ninclude insurance, and receivers and mirrors\nreplacements are substantial compared to solar\nPV and onshore wind energy but these costs\nare also declining with time. The typical costs\nof O&M of plants in operation today are in the\nrange of USD 0.02/kWh to USD 0.04/kWh (REVE\nmagazine, 2020).\nThe proposed capacity of this project will be\n100 MW and its capital cost, O&M costs, and\ncapacity factor are assumed to be the same as\nthose reported in 2019. The estimated annual\nelectricity production is around 394,200,000\nkWh and the capital cost is around 410 million\nJD. The estimated total discounted emission\nreduction is 1929.37 thousand tonnes CO2eq\nduring the 25 years of the project lifetime (20232047).\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\nThis project is expected to be constructed in\n2028. In 2028, it is expected that the capital cost\nof CSP technology will decline by time and will\nreach 4,000 USD/kW while capacity factor will\nincrease to reach 70%. O&M cost is assumed\nto decrease to 0.01 USD/kW. The proposed\ncapacity of this project will be 300 MW with\nan estimated annual electricity production of\naround 1,708,200,000 kWh and a capital cost\nof around million JD 840. The estimated total\ndiscounted emission reduction is 9,003.71\nthousand tonnes CO2eq during the 25 years of\nthe project lifetime (2028-2052).\nSolar Water Heaters 3 – 30,000 houses\nThis mitigation project is similar to the previous\nsolar water heaters (SWH) projects which were\nproposed earlier in TNC and FBUR and were\nsuccessfully implemented by JREEEF/MEMR\nthroughout 2017-2020. This proposed project\nis planned to be implemented over three years\n2022- 2025 with a lifetime of 25 years 2022-2046.\nSWH saves electric energy used to heat water\nfor domestic use. It is assumed that SWH will\nreplace electric heaters and every house requires\na solar water heater of 4.6 m2 and every m2 can\nproduce around 740 kWh/yr. This proposed\nproject includes the installation of 30,000 solar\nwater heaters; the cost of each is 500 JD. The\ninstalled capacity of this project will be 54 MW\nwith an estimated annual electricity reduction of\naround 102 GWh. The estimated total discounted\nemission reduction is 457.53 thousand tonnes\nCO2eq during the 25 years of the project lifetime\n(2022-2046).\nThe cost and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nthree valid renewable energy projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.7.\nTable 3.7: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for renewable\nenergy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions reduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\n100 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n1,929.37\n118.68\n300 MW Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)\n9,003.71\n- 7.18\nSolar Water Heaters 3-30,000 Houses\n457.51\n-189.95\n\n85\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.3 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor energy efficiency (EE)\nEnergy Efficiency (EE) GHG mitigation measures\nthat were considered in the FBUR have been\nreviewed and assessed. All information is presented\nin a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.3. Table\n3.8 is a summary of their current status.\nTable 3.8: Status of the energy efficiency (EE) mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nReplacing high thermal mass with low\nthermal mass (LTM) in ceramic factories\nNot valid. This project was originally proposed to be\nimplemented in 5 Ceramic companies, however, the\nmain Ceramic company in Zarqa and most of other\nceramic industries closed due to high competition of\nimported Ceramic especially from Egypt.\nReturning un-returned condensate to the\nfeed water tanks in food industry\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.

The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nStreet lighting: replacing 125 W Mercury\nlamps with 70 W high pressure Sodium\nlamps\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nsuch as GAM during the period 2017-2020.\nUsing regenerative burners instead of\nconventional burners in Steel Reheating\nStill valid and considered in this BUR. The project is\nassumed to be implemented in 2022.\nUsing variable speed drives in the paper\nfactories pumps\nNot valid. This project was originally proposed to be\nimplemented in paper factories that produce paper\npulp, however, most of these factories are currently\nclosed and ready paper pulp is imported for further\nprocessing.\nLED lighting in public buildings\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nduring the period 2017-2020.\nImproving energy efficiency in small and\nmedium size hotels\nUnder implementation by JREEEF/MEMR as planned,\nduring the period 2017-2020, 16 small and medium\nhotels participated in this program\nLED lighting in households\nImplemented by MEMR and concerned institutions\nduring the period 2017-2020.\nThus, the following four energy efficiency projects\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. The four mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed\nwater tanks in food industry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, condensate resulting from the\n\n86\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\ncondensation of steam is drained without the\nutilization of its heat. Therefore, returning this\ncondensate to the boiler feed water tank will\nsave energy represented by the saved heavy\nfuel oil to operate the boiler in addition to\nsaving in the cost of water treatment and\nwater itself. It is assumed that 10 food factories\nwill implement this energy efficiency measure\nwith a discounted emission reduction of\n7,433.38 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fitting and tanks\nin food industries.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 25 years. In some\nfood factories, the steam and condensate\npipes and valves, and feed water tank are\nuninsulated. Insulating them will save energy\nin the form of saved fuel used to power the\nsteam boiler. It is assumed that 10 food\nfactories will implement this energy efficiency\nmeasure with a discounted emission reduction\nof 8,243.32 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2046).\n\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3,500 new houses.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented in\nthree years starting from 2022 with a lifetime\nof 30 years. It is assumed that 80% of new\nresidential houses are not insulated, so out\nof 3,500 checked houses it is assumed that\nthe insulation of walls and roofs will have\nbeen implemented for 2,800 houses. It is also\nassumed that the saving from this measure is\nabout 50% of the annual heating and cooling\nbills in these houses. It is estimated that this\nenergy efficiency measure will result in a\ndiscounted emission reduction of 69,792.85\ntonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the project\n(2022-2051).\n\nUsing Regenerative Burners Instead of\nConventional Burners in Steel Reheating\nIndustry.\n\nThis proposed project will be implemented\nin 2022 with a lifetime of 20 years. In steel\nfactories, the reheating furnace uses heavy\nfuel oil to reheat the steel billets, usually to\nform the steel into construction steel rods.\nHigh speed pressure jet burners are used\nfor this purpose. Using regenerative burners\ninstead of these conventional burners will\nresult in energy saving of around 10%. It is\nestimated that implementing this energy\nefficiency measure in 5 steel factories will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n72,093.67 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022-2041).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed EE projects have been analyzed. A\nsummary of the results is shown in Table 3.9.\nTable 3.9: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nenergy efficiency mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal emissions\nreduction\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nReduction unit cost\n(JD/tonne of CO2eq)\nReturning un-returned condensate to the feed water\ntanks in food industries\n7.43\n-108.04\nInsulating un-insulated pipes, fittings, and tanks in\nfood industries\n8.24\n-215.16\nInsulating walls and roofs in 3500 new houses\n69.79\n-183.64\nUsing regenerative burners instead of conventional\nburners in steel reheating industries\n72.09\n-110.03\n\n87\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n3.3.4 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures for IPPU sector\nGHG mitigation options in the IPPU sector that were considered in the FBUR report have been reviewed\nand assessed. Relevant information is presented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table A.4. Table 3.10\nis a summary of their status.\nTable 3.10: Status of the IPPU mitigation projects listed in the FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the\nraw materials needed to produce clinker\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\ncement\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nof Pozzolana\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nUse of biomass (MSW or/and Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the nitric acid plant\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for IPPU\nare still valid and moved from FBUR to be updated\nand considered in this SBUR. These mitigation\nprojects are briefly described below.\n\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute\nthe raw materials needed to produce clinker\nat the selected cement plant\nCertain steel slag and fly ash materials (decarbonated kiln feedstock) could be added to the\nraw material feed to reduce the amount of raw\nmaterial needed to produce a given amount of\nclinker. Jordan has more than 5 steel melting and\ngalvanizing factories, therefore there is an available\nstock of steel slag and fly ash to be used in the\ncement industry.\nIn this mitigation project, it is suggested to produce\na new type of cement CEM V (Composite Cement)\nat one of the cement industries; mainly the one that\nhas a neighboring steel manufacturing company\nand can try the production of this type of cement\nwith minor additional costs in comparison to\nother existing companies. The percentages of\nblast-furnace slag and natural Pozzolana range\nbetween 31-49% each, to produce CEM V/B. A\n40% substitution of steel slag/fly ash and a 10%\nproduction of new CEM V/B will be assumed at\nthis company.\nThe price of steel slag and/or fly ash is estimated\nto be 42.3 JD/tonne. The cost of energy and raw\nmaterials reach 61% of total cost and based on\nthe assumption of a production cost of 89.7 JD/\ntonne of cement. This option will reduce the cost\nby 54.7 JD/tonne of cement. No annual increase\nin the production costs will be assumed for the\nproject lifetime. Investment cost to grind the steel\nslag will be estimated as 2,442,928 JD (based on\nthe maximum produced tonnes of CEM II in 2046)\nbased on the estimated cost of 1.37 USD/tonne\ncement.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 250,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022 - 2046)\n\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in\n\nCEM II\nBlended cement is a mixture of clinker and additives\ncontaining less than 95% clinker. Blended cement\ntypes are distinct products with different uses\nthat have different additives and different shares\nof clinker. More than 90% of cement produced at\nthe local cement companies is CEM II (Portland–\nPozzolana Cement) with a percentage of Pozzolana\n\n88\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nranges between 21-32%. Therefore; there is an area\nto increase the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II\nby improving the reactivity of the produced clinker\nand the raw mix to produce CEM II/B-P to achieve\nthe required strength of 42.5N that cause the use\nof Pozzolana of less than 32% (the 3% is substituted\nby gypsum). A reasonable 2% more substitution\ncould be assumed on average and so a reduction\nof CO2 emissions by 2% could be assumed as well.\nSince all local cement companies produce CEM\nII, there is no need for investment to procure the\nequipment needed to receive, store, grind and\nmeter.\nPozzolana to the cement product. The operational\ncost includes the price of extraction of Pozzolana,\npaid to MEMR (previously payment was to the\nNatural Resources Authority) and transportation.\nHowever, this option will reduce the cost of raw\nmaterials (mainly limestone) and energy needed to\nproduce the saved clinker that will be substituted\nby Pozzolana.\nThe price of Pozzolana is estimated to be 36.6 JD/\ntonne. As mentioned above, this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement to save both\nenergy and raw materials and no extra investment\ncost is needed.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, it is\nexpected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is assumed\nto be 25 years.\nIt is estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 367,000 tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime\nof the project (2022-2046)\n\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with\n45% of Pozzolana\nIt is estimated that 10% of currently produced CEM\nII/B-P will be changed to CEM IV, strength 22.5X in\nwhich the Pozzolana substitution will reach 45% (at\nleast 13% more (starting from approximately 32%).\nCO2 reduction will be calculated by multiplying the\nannual CO2 emissions by the reduced percentage of\n13%, this percentage will also be multiplied by the\npercentage of the products that will be converted\nfrom CEM II/B-P to CEM IV which is assumed to be\n10% of CEM II/B-P. Therefore; annual CO2 emissions\nfrom producing CEM II/B-P will be multiplied by\n1.3% to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction as\na result of implementing this option.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, marketing\nthe new product, and setting the legally binding\nregulations and enforcement measures to control\nits use, it is expected to start the implementation of\nthis project in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\nto be 25 years. The price of Pozzolana is estimated\nto be 36.6 JD/tonne and also this option will reduce\nthe cost by 54.7 JD/tonne cement by savings in\nboth energy and raw materials, and with no extra\ninvestment. It is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 238,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nUse of biomass (MSW and/or Sewage Sludge)\nas alternative fuels\nA potential reduction of CO2 emissions in the\ncement industry could be achieved by switching\nfrom traditional fossil fuel to a biomass fuel.\nSince most local cement factories are licensed\nto burn coal, petcoke, oil shale and alternative\nfuels such as waste tires and used oil, to replace\nthe expensive heavy fuel oil, they are equipped\nwith multi-purpose burners which reduce the\ninvestment costs for using biomass as alternative\nfuels. However, the required capital cost depends\non the needed storage, segregation, handling,\ngrinding and metering as well as environmental\npollution control measures. A value of 27.5 JOD/\ntonne of alternative fuel is used to estimate the\ninvestment cost based on the maximum estimated\ntonnes needed in 2046. So, the investment cost for\nthis option is estimated at 129,942,957 JD.\nTo allow time for the experimental trials, studies\nof the maximum percentage of MSW and dried\nsewage sludge to be used, availability of stocks\nin the market, testing the emissions, conduct EIA\nstudy and getting the environmental clearance;\nit is expected to start the implementation of this\nproject in 2022. The project lifetime is estimated\n\n89\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nto be 25 years. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 814,000 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2046).\n\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia\nburner of the Nitric Acid plant\nThis project involves the installation of a new N2O\nabatement technology that is not commonly used\nin nitric acid plants. The abatement technology is\na pelleted catalyst that will be installed inside the\nammonia burner just underneath the precious\nmetal gauzes. This technology is capable of\nreducing approximately 75% to 80% of the N2O\nformed at the precious metal gauzes inside\nthe ammonia burner to atmospheric N2 and O2\n(through communication with KEMAPCO).\nThe selected N2O abatement technology depends\non replacing some of the Al2O3 balls that support\nthe platinum-rhodium catalyst by a base metal\nsecondary catalyst, which is capable of reducing\nN2O by at least 75%.\nThis project will only be implemented for the sake\nof GHG emissions reduction; there are no other\ndirect benefits. Therefore, its implementation is\nstrongly dependent on the provision of economic\nincentives. The project is assumed to start in 2022\nand its lifetime is estimated to be the same as the\nlifetime of the KEMAPCO plant, which is estimated\nto be 25 years (till the year 2046). It is estimated\nthat implementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n1,659,000 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2046).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed IPPU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed. A summary of the results is shown in\nTable 3.11.\nTable 3.11: Emissions reduction (Gg of CO2eq) and emissions reduction unit cost (JD/tonne of CO2eq) for the\nIPPU mitigation projects\nProject Name\nTotal reduction for\nthe project lifetime\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nMitigation cost\n(JD/tonne of\nCO2eq)\nUse of steel slag and/or fly ash to substitute the raw\nmaterials needed to produce clinker\n250\n-22.9\nIncrease the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM II cement\n367\n-32.1\nProduce new cement product CEM IV with 45%\nPozzolana\n238\n-32.0\nUse of biomass (MSW and/ or Sewage Sludge) as\nalternative fuels\n814\n-69.3\nCatalytic reduction of N2O inside the ammonia burner\nof the nitric acid plant\n1,659\n0.37\n3.3.5 Updates on the FBUR mitigation measures\nfor AFOLU sector\nThe main mitigation options within AFOLU mainly\ninvolve one or more of three strategies:\n\nReduction/prevention of emissions to the\natmosphere by conserving existing carbon\npools in soils or vegetation that would\notherwise be lost, or by reducing emissions\nof CH4 and N2O,\n\nSequestration—enhancing the uptake of\ncarbon in terrestrial reservoirs, and thereby\nremoving CO2 from the atmosphere,\n\n90\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nReducing CO2 emissions by introducing\nchanges within demand-side options (e.g., by\nlifestyle changes, reducing losses and waste\nof food, changes in human diet, changes in\nwood consumption).\nGHG mitigation options in the AFOLU sector that\nwere considered in the FBUR report have been\nreviewed and updated. Relevant information is\npresented in a tabular format in Appendix A, Table\nA.5. Table 3.12 is a summary of their status.\nTable 3.12: Status of the AFOLU mitigation projects listed in FBUR\nProject Name\nStatus\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in urban areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in northern area\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 1- Restoration of rangeland areas\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nRangeland 2- New protected rangeland area as\nnatural reserve\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nPromoting for climate-smart agricultural practices in\nthe Jordan Valley\nStill valid and considered in this BUR.\nThus, all the five FBUR mitigation projects for\nAFOLU are still valid. The projects will be modified\nand updated to be considered in this SBUR. These\nmitigation projects are briefly described below.\n\nIntroduce new trees plantation in Urban Areas\nLosses in urban trees are a continuous concern\neither due to snow storms, or from burning, and\ncutting due to land use change. No official numbers\nhave been published, but it was assumed that an\naverage loss of around 2,500 trees within Greater\nAmman Municipality area will be compensated\nfor, mostly by planting pine and coniferous trees.\nA medium growth coniferous tree, planted in an\nurban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years,\nsequesters 0.060-tonnes CO2 per planted tree. It\nis estimated that implementing this mitigation\nmeasure will result in a discounted emission\nreduction of 1,502 tonnes CO2 over the lifetime of\nthe project (2022 – 2042).\n\nForestry- Introduce new plantations in\nNorthern\nArea\nLosses in forest trees are a continuous concern,\neither due to snow storms, burning or illegal cutting.\nNo official numbers have been published regarding\nthe loss, but it was assumed that an average loss\nof around 30,000 trees within the Northern Area\nwill be compensated for, mostly by planting pine\nand coniferous trees. A medium growth coniferous\ntree, planted in an urban setting and allowed to\ngrow for 10 years, sequesters 0.060-tonne CO2 per\nplanted tree. It is estimated that implementing\nthis mitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 11,923 tonne CO2 over the\nlifetime of the project (2022 – 2042).\n\nRangeland restoration and increase in forage\nproduction Projects\nThe projects suggest that the Ministry of Agriculture\nestablish a public corporation responsible for\nforage production and sales to livestock owners.\nThe corporation will be responsible for buying the\nplants and for hiring labor for cultivation.\nTwo areas for production will be considered:\n Rangelands Project 1: Restoration of\nRangeland Areas and Rangelands\n\n50,000 dunums in the Badia (Al Jafr and\nAl Husseinieh) sub-districts within the\nMa’an Governorate. It is assumed that the\nproductivity of these area will be 50 kg/\ndunum of dry matter (in areas with 100200 mm rainfall). Suggested plant types are\nperennial fodder shrubs. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will\nresult in a discounted emission reduction of\n888,140 tonne CO2 over the lifetime of the\nproject (2022 – 2036).\n\n91\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nProject 2: New Protected Rangeland Area\n as Natural Reserve combined\n100,000 dunums in the wide desert valleys of\nsouth Badia. The average annual dry matter\nproduction is 4 kg/dunum in normal years\nand with good restoration practices, the\nproductivity can be increased to 15 kg/dunum.\nThe project will harness direct benefits for\nprotection of floral biodiversity through\ncontrolling the grazing of the indigenous\nAtriplex halimus shrubs. Much of this area is\ncovered with chert and an underlying thin\nlayer of fine textured soil. Artemisia herba-\nalba, Retama raetam, Achillea fragrantissima,\nAtriplex halimus and Poa bulbosa are common\nin the wadi beds. Despite its deterioration this\nregion is known to be the main grazing land\nin Jordan.\nIt is estimated that implementing this\nmitigation measure will result in a discounted\nemission reduction of 1,776,280 tonnes CO2\nover the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2036).\nThe projects will achieve reductions through CO2\nemissions offset from natural soil carbon release\ncaused by rangeland deterioration. The project will\nharness direct benefit for soil resources through\nrain harvest techniques as well as soil erosion\ncontrol techniques (erosion is caused by flow from\nflash floods). It is assumed to have an average of 35\naverage sized shrub/dunum and the sequestration\nrate is 5.57 tonnes SOC/ha/year and a lifetime of\n15 years will be assumed for calculation purposes.\n\nPromoting climate-smart agricultural practices\nin the Jordan Valley\nClimate smart agriculture is not a new agricultural\nsystem, nor is it a set of practices. It is a new approach,\na way to guide the needed changes of agricultural\nsystems, given the necessity to jointly address food\nsecurity and climate change. It contributes to the\nachievement of sustainable development goals\nand integrates the three dimensions of sustainable\ndevelopment (economic, social and environmental)\nby jointly addressing food security and climate\nchallenges. It is composed of three main pillars:\nSustainably increasing agricultural productivity\nand incomes; adapting and building resilience\nto climate change; reducing and/or removing\ngreenhouse gases emissions, where possible.\nSustainable crop production, controlled grazing\nand maintained forest systems can sequester\nsubstantial and variable amounts of carbon from\nthe atmosphere and store it in soils and vegetation.\nCarbon sequestration will not only stabilize climate\nbut will also increase the overall resilience of the\nagro-ecosystems. Widespread adoption of climate-\nsmart practices has the potential to make major\ncontributions to the achievement of national food\nsecurity and development goals. It is estimated that\nimplementing this mitigation measure will result in\na discounted emission reduction of 13,057 tonnes\nCO2 over the lifetime of the project (2022 – 2026).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for the\nproposed AFOLU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed.

These mitigation projects\nare briefly described below.\n\nBiogas collection and utilization from AlDhulil domestic solid waste landfill. A\nconsiderable amount of biogas could only\nbe generated from Al-Dulail landfill while\nAl-Karak, Al-Salt and Madaba domestic solid\nwaste landfill sites were considered not valid\ndue to low production of gas in those sites.\n\nThe proposed project aims at collecting the\ngenerated biogas, treating it for impurities,\ngenerating electricity using biogas generator\nand connecting the generated electricity to\nthe national electricity grid. The suggested\nproject will contribute to reducing the\namount of fuel used for electricity generation.\nThe starting year for implementing this\nproject is 2022 and construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year,\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nproject will be in 2023. The lifetime of the\nproject is 25 years ( 2022 – 2047).\n\nBiogas generation by utilizing the sludge\ngenerated from the domestic wastewater\ntreatment plants. The project was considered\nto be valid for Wadi Arab, Baqa’a, and\nMadaba domestic wastewater treatment\nplants and thus emission reductions were\nrecalculated while it was considered invalid\nfor Ramtha and Salt due to decreased inflow\nof wastewater to these treatment plants.\n\nThe proposed projects aim at generating\nbiogas from the sludge and connecting\nthe generated electricity to the national\nelectricity\ngrid.\nThese\nprojects\nwill\ncontribute to reducing the amount of fuel\nused for electricity generation, taking into\nconsideration that a considerable amount\nof sludge produced from the wastewater\ntreatment plants without any utilization.\nIn the three projects of Wadi Arab, Baqa’a,\nand Madaba the construction activities,\ncommissioning, and testing will take 1 year\nso the actual operation for the proposed\nprojects will be the next year. The starting\nyear for implementing the proposed projects\nin Madaba and Wadi Al Arab is 2021 for a\nlifetime of 25 years (2021 to 2046) while the\nproject in Baqa’a will be implemented in 2025\nfor a lifetime of 25 years (2025 to 2049).\nThe following assumptions were used during the\nupdate of waste projects:\n\nTotal amount of organic material generated\nis assumed to increase annually by 2.2%,\n\nDensity of methane is 0.717 kg/m3,\n\nThe captured methane from all landfills\nis calculated according to the PRIF study\n(Environment and use of methane from\nmunicipal waste in Amman, 1993), where\nthe average value is used,\n\nElectricity grid emission factor is considered\nto be 0.4585 kgCO2/KWh,\n\nThe calculation of generated electricity in MW\nis based on 8,000 working hours per year,\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nsludge produced at wastewater treatment\nplants is assumed to be sold at a fixed price of\n0.094 JD/kWh (each kW produced is assumed\nto replace 1kw sold from the electricity grid),\n\nThe generated electricity from utilization of\nbiogas produced from landfills is assumed\nto be sold at a fixed price of 0.06 JD/kWh,\n\nThe cost of a 1 MW biogas electricity\ngeneration landfill system (generator, wells,\npiping, etc.) is 1.5 million JD, according to\nthe International Renewable Energy Agency\n(IRENA),\n\nThe cost of 1 MW biogas electricity generation\nfrom biogas system (digester, WWTP\ngenerator, piping, etc.) is 4 million JD (Jordan\nbiogas project),\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of\nmaintenance, operation, overheads and\nsupervision costs (3% of capital cost) in\nwastewater\ntreatment\nplant\nsystems,\n\n94\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe fixed annual cost is the sum of maintenance,\noperation, overheads, and supervision costs\nin biogas projects in landfills (5% of capital\ninvestment, according to IRENA).\nAll mitigation options under the waste sector were\nconsidered as energy measures because the biogas\nwill be used for electric power generation. The cost\nand the CO2 emission reductions are analyzed for\nthe 5 proposed projects.

These projects belong to\nseveral sectors and subsectors including primary\nenergy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste,\nand agriculture.\nIt is concluded from the abatement cost analysis\nfor the updated FBUR valid projects that the most\nfeasible options are the energy mitigation projects.\nThe findings indicated that in particular the energy\nefficiency should receive the most attention.

Some of these elements are implemented at\nthe international level and others at the national\nlevel.\nAt the international level, the MRV framework for\ndeveloping countries includes:\n\nGuidance on reporting through National\nCommunications (NCs) and Biennial Update\nReports (BURs),\n\nGuidance on setting up domestic MRV\nframeworks,\n\nA process for consideration of information\nsubmitted by developing countries in their\nBURs through an International Consultant\nand Analysis (ICA),\n\nInternational guidance on MRV for those\ndeveloping\ncountries\nthat\nvoluntarily\nimplement reforestation and avoided\ndeforestation activities and wish to take the\nopportunity of a results-based payment.\nAt the national level, Parties to the UNFCCC\nare expected to implement these international\nguidance and to prepare and report information\nevery two years through their NCs and BURs.\nThe list of information elements to be reported\nincludes annual GHG emissions inventories,\nmitigation actions and their estimated effects, as\nwell as technical and financial support needed and\nreceived. Jordan was among the first developing\ncountries to submit its first NC under the UNFCCC\nin 1997.\nMRV is central to effectively implement the NDCs,\nwhich describes countries mitigation goals and\npolicies submitted under the Paris Agreement.\nMeasurement is needed to identify emissions\ntrends, determine where to focus Green House\nGas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts, track\nmitigation-related support, assess whether\nmitigation actions planned under the NDCs\nare effective, evaluate the impact of support\nreceived, and monitor progress achieved in\nreducing emissions. Reporting and verification\nare important for ensuring transparency, good\ngovernance, accountability, and credibility of\nresults, and for building confidence that resources\nare being utilized effectively.\nAt COP 13, through the Bali Action Plan, Parties\nagreed on the principle of applying MRV for\ndeveloping country Parties, which laid the\nfoundation for the subsequent elaboration of\nthe existing comprehensive MRV framework for\ndeveloping country Parties. MRV occurs at the\ninternational level, but can also be voluntary at\nthe national level.\n4.2 Jordan’s multi-tiered MRV system\nDuring 2016, Jordan with the support of the World\nBank has submitted its Market Readiness Proposal\n(MRP) to the Partnership for Market Readiness\n(PMR) initiative. Jordan’s MRP outlined a plan for\nimplementing the market readiness components\nthat will be necessary to support the development\nof appropriate market based instruments.\nThe PMR initiative in Jordan is led by the Ministry\nof Environment, in collaboration with an interministerial technical working group. At the\ncurrent phase, the PMR initiative, has identified\nthe energy and water sectors as priority sectors\nfor mitigation actions (with energy efficiency (EE)\nand renewable energy (RE) identified as pilot\ncross-sector interventions). The initiative aimed\nat fulfilling three components:\n\nA national MRV system and registry for\nclimate\nmitigation\nmeasures,\n\nDesigning a platform for private sector\nfinancing in EE and RE,\n\nExploring the potential for market based\ninstruments for climate mitigation measures.\n\n101\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nIn February 2018, the first milestone was achieved\nwith developing a multi-tiered integrated MRV\nsystem. The first version of the system - still in\nthe experimental phase - covers the public sector\nenergy projects (RE and EE); adding GHG data and\nsupport data at sectoral and national level from\ndifferent sectors and will serve in tracking progress\ntowards Nationally Determined Contribution\n(NDC) commitments.\nThe main functions of the system are shown in\nthe figure below (adopted from PMR initiative\nbrochure, 2018), and they are described briefly\nin the subsequent sections.\nFigure 4.1: The main functions of the MRV system (adopted from PMR initiative Brochure, 2018).\nData Extracting, Transforming & Loading:\nthe system acts as database for GHG emissions\nat project, ministry, sectoral and national levels,\nwith main functions of; metadata1 viewing and\nediting, reference2 data monitoring, emissions\ndata monitoring and uploading data in a standard\nformat or automatically importing data.\nData Processing: the system provides a database\nof validated emissions and reduction, with main\nfunctions of pre-determined calculations of data\ncompared to previous years and calculation of\nGHGs and emission reduction based on proxy\ndata3 and modelled scenarios.\n2. Data used to classify or categorize other data\n3. Data that measures the cause and effect relationship between two\n variables indirectly.\nData Review and Verification: the system provides\napproved GHG emissions database:\n\nValidated GHG emissions and emission\nreductions data based on reviews and\nverification (by third party, if applicable),\n\nStatus of emissions and GHG emission\nreductions and browse/change data values.\nData Reporting: the system provides a database\nfor final GHG emissions.\nData are reported and shared in a standard format\navailable in graphics and tables.\n1. A set of data that describes and gives information about other data.\n\n102\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nThe following figures (Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3)\nillustrates the designed MRV system.

Also,\nnon-Annex I parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity-building and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility,\nParties included in Annex II to the Convention\nand other developed country Parties, the Green\nClimate Fund and multilateral institutions for\nactivities relating to climate change, including for\nthe preparation of the current biennial update\nreport.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nAccordingly, this chapter aims at providing a\nbrief description of the constraints and gaps\nidentified in previous national climate change\ncommunications and the First Biennial Update\nReport (FBUR). It will also identify newly arising\nconstraints and gaps, and needed actions and\nresources required to overcome them.\n5.2 Institutional Constraints and Gaps and\nPolicy Mainstreaming\n5.2.1 Current institutional arrangements\nClimate change (CC) Directorate, Environment Law\nNo. 6/2017 and CC bylaw No.79/2019.\nThe Directorate of Climate Change was established\nat the MoEnv in 2014 to act as the institutional hub\nfor coordinating and developing all climate change\nactivities in Jordan in relation to the UNFCCC and\nthe global climate change governance system and\ninitiatives.\nJordan has issued in May 2017 a new Environmental\nProtection Law (No.6/2017) that mandates the\nMoEnv to “coordinate national efforts to project\nClimate Change impacts, identify the sectors\naffected, and limit and mitigate greenhouse gas\nemissions by means such as funding, technology\ntransfer and reallocation of available funding and\nits distribution to Climate Change activities”.\nAnother significant milestone, is the issuance of\nthe Climate Change Bylaw No. 79 in 2019 which\nwas adopted pursuant to article no. 30(a) of the\nEnvironmental Protection Law No. 6/2017. The\nBylaw came as a response to the need to define\na framework that establishes a clear institutional\nsetting to address climate change challenges\nand ensure full engagement of all partners and\nstakeholders including both the technical experts\nand the decision makers.\nUnder the provisions of this bylaw, a National\nClimate Change Committee (NCCC) has been\nformed. This Committee is chaired by the Minister\nof Environment and consists of the secretary\ngenerals and high level members from the related\ninstitutions.\nThe bylaw identified the responsibility of the\nMoEnv as UNFCCC focal point to:\na. Seek approval from the NCCC on proposed\npolicies and strategies to adapt to the\nnegative impacts of climate change, and\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to be\nsubmitted to the Cabinet for adoption and\ninclusion in sectoral policies and strategies,\nb.\nPrepare nationally determined contributions,\nnational communication reports, biennial\nupdate reports, national adaptation plans\nand other climate change relevant documents\nand update them according to international\nconventions and obligations,\nc. Represent the Kingdom in international\nclimate change commissions and conferences,\nd.\nCreate and manage a national inventory\ndatabase to document emissions data,\nmitigation and adaptation measures and\nclimate finance data,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n107\ne. Authorize accredited entities to verify the\nresults of national inventory reports according\nto a criteria that will be set for this purpose,\nf. Provide technical support to scientific research\ncentres through opening up channels of\ncommunication with equivalent international\nclimate research centres,\ng.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders to\ndevelop a national climate finance plan, that\nidentifies projects, programmes and plans of\npriority,\nh.\nCoordinate with national stakeholders with\nregard to climate change market mechanisms.\nIn addition to the NCCC, technical teams are\nnominated according to specific needs; consisting\nof experts and specialists from governmental\norganizations, scientific research institutions, civil\nsociety organizations, and other related entities\nidentified in the bylaw.\nAlso, the bylaw set a group of entities mandated to\nsupport the MoEnv with providing data, available\nat their entities, needed for GHG inventory\nestimation, NDCs and financial support tracking.\nEstablishment of Green Economy Unit\nA Green Economy Unit was established at the\nMoEnv in 2014, with the purpose of coordinating\nthe national efforts regarding developing and\nupdating the green economy national strategies\nand legislation in accordance with the sectoral\nneeds. This unit works hand in hand with the\nClimate Change Directorate (CCD) to support\nenvironmental and climate action in Jordan, while\nalso achieving sustainable economic green growth\nobjectives.\nIn 2017 and with the support of Global Green\nGrowth Institute (GGGI) and UNEP, a National\nGreen Growth strategy, was published, it has\nidentified green growth as a top national priority.\nThen, recently in 2020, the Green Growth National\nAction Plans for (2021-2025) was launched for\nsix main sectors (energy, waste, water, transport,\nagriculture and tourism).\nNDC Partnership\nIn March 2017, Jordan through the MoEnv joined\nthe NDC Partnership as a member country, Jordan\nbecame a part of the global coalition of 130\ncountries and institutions working together to\nmobilize support and achieve ambitious climate\ngoals. As a global coalition emerging from the\nParis Agreement, the NDC Partnership works with\nJordan to shift the NDC’s focus from commitment\nto implementation, supporting fast-tracked,\nenhanced NDC implementation. By facilitating and\ncoordinating the delivery of technical and financial\nsupport and knowledge services, the Partnership\naims to bridge Jordan’s NDC implementation\nneeds with Partnership resources.\nTo accelerate the implementation of its NDC, the\nGovernment of Jordan (GoJ) unveiled its NDC\nAction Plan in April 2019. Jordan’s NDC Action\nPlan is a detailed statement of measures aligned\nwith the mitigation and adaptation objectives\nstated in its NDC. It offers a concrete roadmap\nfor transitioning to a low-emissions and climate\nresilient economy by increasing the share of\nrenewables in the energy mix and scaling up\nenergy efficiency measures; adapting to the\nimpacts of climate change in water, agricultural\nand health sectors; and strengthening the\nresilience of vulnerable groups and ecosystems.\nThe measures listed in the Action Plan are at\ndifferent stages of development and require\ndifferent types of support, including technical\nsupport for feasibility studies, developing\nfinancing strategies, monitoring and evaluation\nservices, and financial support for implementation\nof the investment ready measures.\nMainstreaming climate change at the national\nlevel\nOn the national level many institutions made\nconsiderable progress in including climate\nchange in their entities mandates. Many\nnational institutions established climate change\ndirectorates or units to follow up with Ministry of\nEnvironment, such as the ministries of Agriculture,\nWater and Irrigation, Transport, The National\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n108\nAgriculture Research Centre, and The Royal\nJordanian Geographic Centre.\nAlso, recently the Ministry of Environment\nsigned an agreement with King Abdullah II\nCentre for Excellence to update the Environment\nSustainability Award for industries to enhance their\ncommitments towards environment protection\nincluding the reduction of GHGs.\nThe private sector is engaging as well, with a\nunit for energy and environmental sustainability\nestablished in Jordan Chamber of Industry,\nthrough which they work with the industries\nand the government to encourage low emission\ntechnologies.\nOne of the most recent strategies that was recently\nlaunched, is the National Energy Strategy 2020\n– 2030. This strategy aims to reduce the CO2\nemissions by 10% by 2030. Also the Agriculture\nDevelopment National Strategy 2020-2025\nfocused on adaptation and the impacts of climate\nchange on biodiversity and land degradation.\nAt the city level, Greater Amman Municipality in\ncooperation with Ministry of Environment and\nWorld Bank launched in 2018 “Amman Climate\nPlan - A Vision for 2050 Amman”. This inaugural\nplan sets an interim target of a 40% reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This plan sets\nout a shared vision for collaboration among the\ngovernment, private sector, development partners\nand residents of Amman. This plan is a living,\nevolving document that the city will continue to\nbuild on until reaching a carbon-neutral city in\n2050.\n5.2.2 Identified gaps and constraints and\nrecommendations to address them\nThe CCD at Ministry of Environment, as UNFCCC\nfocal point, plays a pivotal role in climate change\nactivities at the national level. However, the\ndirectorate needs strengthening in term of human\nresources and sustainability. It is recommended\nto increase the number of the staff and enhance\ntheir capacity to be able to carry out their huge\nresponsibilities in the long term.\nAlthough the climate change bylaw was issued\nin 2019, it is not fully functioning yet. Up to date,\nthe number of meetings, between the NCCC and\nthe technical teams is not sufficient and no major\ndecisions have been taken on the ground. Also,\nthere are entities identified in Annex (3) of the\nbylaw who are responsible for providing needed\ndata for the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory\nestimation, however, only a slight improvement\nwas detected in providing and facilitating\ncollection of data and still more collaboration is\nneeded.\nThe following are some recommendations to\nenact and activate the bylaw, its committee and\ntechnical groups:\n\nIt is recommended that MoEnv as chair of\nthe NCCC highlights continually the role of\ndifferent ministries and institutions in the\narea of climate change and the need for\ncooperation to fulfil Jordan’s commitments,\n\nSeek support from international capacity\nbuilding programs to enable and strengthen\nthe committee and technical groups formed\naccording to the climate change bylaw, in\nareas relevant to their roles,\n\nIt is recommended to invest in building the\ncapacities of the focal points acting in the\ntechnical groups and appoint them to their\npositions for a sufficient period of time (at\nleast 3 years) to be able to strengthen their\nwork and it’s highly recommended to prepare\ntheir successors in advance,\n\nCCDs at different ministries and institutions\nare important vehicles to mainstream climate\nchange into the strategies and policies of\ntheir respective institutions. As such, it is\nrecommend that the MoEnv coordinates\ncontinuously with these departments and\nsupports them in identifying their capacity\nbuilding needs.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n109\n5.3 Technical and Capacity Building Needs\n5.3.1 Identified gaps and capacity building needs\nthrough the Technical Analysis- ICA process\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the\nUNFCCC was prepared and submitted in late 2017.\nAfter its submission, a Team of Technical Experts\n(TTE) were formed by the UNFCCC secretariat to\nperform review. These experts were trained to\nconduct reviews as part of the ICA according to\nDecision 2/CP.17, Annex IV.\nFollowing the TTE review and during COP24,\nJordan’s first BUR was subjected to the Facilitative\nSharing of Views (FSV) during the 49th Subsidiary\nBody for Implementation (SBI 49). The FSV\nobjective is to identify capacity-building needs\nof developing countries in order to enhance\ntransparency of mitigation actions. The following\nare the identified capacity-building needs related\nto the facilitation of the preparation of subsequent\nBURs and the NCs:\na. Enhance technical capacity on using surrogate\ndata and other splicing techniques from the\n2006 IPCC Guidelines that can help fill gaps\nof historical data and generate a consistent\ntime series;\nb.\nDevelop technical capacity for data collection\nand estimation of emissions of HFCs on\na gas-by-gas basis, particularly capacitybuilding needs related to collecting data\nfrom equipment, disposal and processing\nraw data from the custom departments and\nother national and/or international sources;\nc. Develop technical capacity to perform\nkey source category analysis, particularly\ncapacity-building needs for executing level\nand trend analysis, and to use the outcomes\nof the key category analysis;\nd.\nDevelop technical capacity to perform\nuncertainty analysis, particularly capacitybuilding needs for the quantification of\nuncertainties of activity data and Emission\nFactors (EFs) and other parameters of each\nsource/sink category, and to use the outcomes\nof uncertainty analysis;\ne. Enhance technical capacity to conduct\nongoing surveys to provide accurate data\nand to integrate climate change questions\nin existing energy surveys that mainly focus\non energy,\nf. Enhance capacity for data collection, project\nlabelling and tracking information for\nreporting the technology support received,\ng.\nEnhance technical capacity for developing\nnational emission factors and using higher tier\nmethods in the categories defined as key and\nparticularly in the AFOLU and waste sectors,\nh.\nEnhance technical capacity to report\non mitigation actions that are already\nimplemented or ongoing across all sectors,\ni. Enhance technical capacity for establishing\na verification and tracking system of GHG\nreductions for various mitigation actions\nacross all sectors,\nj. Enhance capacity in reporting progress\nand the underlying steps envisaged for the\nplanned mitigation actions and when they\nwill be implemented,\nk. Enhance capacity for analysing emission\nreductions during the implementation period\nfor each mitigation action.\n5.3.2 Reported capacity-building needs in Jordan’s\nFBUR\nThe following capacity-building needs were\nreported in the FBUR (most of them are still valid)\ncovering the following areas:\nGHG inventory preparation, including:\n\nThere is a need to build capacity in the use\nof the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Software.\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 did not provide emission estimates for\nindirect GHGs such as CO, NOx, NMVOC, and\nother gases not controlled by the Montreal\nProtocol, such as SOx because the 2006 IPCC\nSoftware does not support the estimation of\nthose gases,\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n110\n\nThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 have been estimated using the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines, which have structural and\nmethodological differences with the Revised\n1996 IPCC Guidelines used in estimating GHG\nemissions inventories for earlier NCs, which\nmade it difficult to provide a consistent time\nseries,\n\nIn preparing all GHG inventories so far, default\nemission factors were used since there are\nno available studies to develop national\nemission factors. The use of national emission\nfactors is highly vital, particularly for key\ncategories within the inventory.\n GHG mitigation measures, including:\n\nStakeholders had limited expertise and\nknowledge\ncapacity\nfor\nconducting\nmitigation analysis for the transportation,\nIPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors,\n\nThe complex nature of mitigation actions\nand initiatives that are being developed\nand implemented within the UNFCCC had\nbeen a challenge. The various potentials and\nfeatures of Clean Development Mechanism\n(CDM), Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\nActions (NAMAs), Low Emission Development\n(LED), Intended Nationally Determined\nContributions (INDCs), and other mitigation\ntools make it difficult for a holistic planning\nperspective in climate change mitigation,\n\nData quality, completeness, and accuracy\nare of a primary concern when it comes to\nestablishing the baseline and mitigation\nanalysis. Data are not up to date, nor are\nthey readily available in one place.\n5.3.3 Capacity building needs and\nrecommendations to fulfill commitments under\nthe Paris Agreement (PA)\nThe Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency\nFramework (ETF) places new and more strict\nrequirements on developing countries. To\nimplement these new requirements capacitybuilding support is vital. Article 11 of the PA\nemphasizes the importance of building the\ncapacity of developing country Parties. The\nobjective is to allow them to take effective\nclimate change actions, particularly via the\nimplementation of adaptation and mitigation\nactions, so as to facilitate “technology development,\ndissemination and deployment, access to climate\nfinance, relevant aspects of education, training and\npublic awareness and the transparent, timely and\naccurate communication of information”.\nAlso, capacity building is essential to drive climate\ntransparency. The 2015 PA outlines an “Enhanced\nTransparency Framework” including greater\nrequirements for developing countries. Some\ndeveloping countries have struggled to fulfill preParis Agreement transparency requirements and\nwill need capacity-building support to implement\nthe PA’s more stringent requirements (WRI\nWorking paper, 2019).\nThe new requirements for the PA’s enhanced\ntransparency framework have shown that\nthese requirements represent greater efforts\nto communicate on climate change action and\nsupport. Countries agreed on the guidelines\nfor the enhanced transparency framework in\nDecember 2018. However, new efforts to build\ncapacity for the transparency framework need not\n“start from scratch” but should build on and learn\nfrom the history of transparency and capacity\nbuilding under the UNFCCC.\nThe processes under the PA, including the\ntechnical expert review and the facilitative,\nmultilateral consideration of progress under\nArticle 13, the global stock take under Article 14,\nand the mechanism to facilitate implementation\nand promote compliance under Article 15 are\nexcellent capacity-building instruments since\nthey help countries improve their transparencyrelated governance systems and improve data\nand information needs for reporting. Building or\ndeveloping capacity is a process that takes time\nand requires Jordan to “learn by doing”, and by\nleveraging national experiences, lessons learned,\nand emerging tools or approaches developed over\nthe past 20 years.\nCapacity for transparency can be strengthened\nthrough enhanced governance and institutional\nstructures and supported by the right participatory\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n111\napproach. Jordan must organize institutional and\ngovernance structures able to collect, report, and\nuse data for decision-making. Governments’ ability\nto engage effectively with key stakeholders is\ncritical to obtaining data of quality and in turn\nproviding the right signals and guidance to\nconvince stakeholders to support government’s\nefforts.\nLasting systems and knowledge are critical to\nbuilding capacity. More effort is required to\nbuild the critical knowledge within key national\ninstitutions, by looking at the educational\nchannels and exploring further pedagogical\napproaches, including twinning programs, to\nproduce active national and regional peer and\nprofessional communities. National capacitybuilding centres—national universities and\ntraining centres—need to play a central role\nin the building of more durable processes for\ncollecting and managing better data, while\ncreating sustainable skills and jobs.\nJordan has already started the capacity building\nprocess by taking part in the BUR ICA (as\nmentioned\npreviously).\nAs for the implementation of Article 6 (A6) under\nthe PA, Jordan has recently started the work of\npreparing a roadmap to promote and facilitate\nJordan’s engagement in A6. A working committee\nhas been formed, aiming at raising awareness and\nbuilding the capacity of the national stakeholders.\nArticle 6 has three operative paragraphs, two\nof which relate to carbon markets: (1) Article\n6.2 provides an accounting framework for\ninternational cooperation, such as linking the\nemissions-trading schemes of two or more\ncountries. It also allows for the international\ntransfer of carbon credits between countries, (2)\nArticle 6.4 establishes a central UN mechanism to\ntrade credits from emissions reductions generated\nthrough specific projects, (3) Article 6.8 establishes\na work program for non-market approaches, such\nas applying taxes to discourage emissions.\nWhile A6 established these concepts in broad\nstrokes and countries achieved some progress\non defining the rules over the years, their final\nshape remains yet to be agreed.\n5.4 Technology Needs Assessment and\nTechnology\nTransfer\nThe Ministry of Environment, with Global\nEnvironment\nFacility\n(GEF)-UNDP\nsupport,\nhas previously published a Technology Needs\nAssessment (TNA) and technology transfer report\nfor 2004-2005. More recently, the Ministry has\ncompleted a climate change technology needs\nassessment for Jordan for the period 2015-2017,\nwhere three reports have been published by\nthis project. The first report is for the selection\nof priority mitigation and adaptation sectors\nfor TNA activities in Jordan. The second report\npresented a list of the main barriers and an\nenabling framework, while the third report,\nwhich was published in August 2017, offered a\ntechnology action plan for two priority mitigation\nsectors (energy and transport) and two priority\nadaptation sectors (water and agriculture).\nThe following TNA analysis is extracted from the\nthree published reports.\nThe top three mitigation technologies for the\nenergy sector were:\n(1) Solar thermal,\n(2) PV for electrification, and\n(3) PV for water pumping.\nThe three top-ranked priority mitigation\ntechnologies for the transportation sector were:\n(1) Bus Rapid Transit,\n(2) Improving pedestrian infrastructure, and\n(3) Ticketing systems to improve the quality and\nthe attractiveness of public transport services.\nThe final results for the water sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Roof-top rainwater harvesting,\n(2) Augmenting and expansion of Water Users\nAssociation (WUAs), and\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n112\n(3) Desalination and brackish water treatment\nand re-use.\nThe results for the agricultural sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Water saving technologies, such as drip or\nsubsurface irrigation,\n(2) Farm-level water harvesting, and\n(3) Plant varieties resistant to climate change.\nAlso recently, in April 2020, the Green Growth\nAction Plan (GGAP) was published by MoEnv,\nidentifying clearly the relation between the green\ngrowth and the climate change. The GGAP focused\non many interventions related to technology and\nknowledge transfer in the six sectors; the below\nare selected technologies that were identified:\nEnergy\n\nImprove energy demand management\nthrough development of a smart electricity\ngrid,\n\nImplement electric vehicle charging stations\nand services provision in Greater Amman\nMunicipality through a public-private\npartnership,\n\nDevelop and implement a national energy\nstorage action plan and investment pipeline,\n\nIncrease public investment in energy sector\nresearch and development,\n\nImprove the enabling environment and\ncapacity development support for the\ngrowth of the Energy Services Companies\n(ESCOs) market.\nTransport\n\nSupport the deployment of Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS) to allow a modal\nand fair integration of the public and private\ntransport systems in the city of Amman,\n\nEstablish a national centre of excellence and\ncapacity building program for sustainable\ntransport,\n\nDevelop a national electric mobility strategy\nand action plan,\n\nDesign and implement a public transport\nelectric mobility pilot and capacity building\nprogram in Amman.\nWaste\n\nEstablish a national centre for excellence on\nwaste management and circular economy\nto promote innovation, training, R&D,\ninvestment, and policy work,\n\nConduct market assessment and feasibility\nstudy to identify potential projects and\nprograms to divert organic waste from\nmunicipal solid waste streams.\nWater\n\nTechnical Assistance to support water\nefficiency in businesses, industries, and\ncommercial activities (Based on SwitchMed1\nExperience),\n\nExpand the Samra Wastewater Treatment\nPlant (Phase III),\n\nUndertake Desalination of Seawater at the\nGulf of Aqaba through Renewable Energy\nSources.\nAgriculture\n\nMap and optimize research to impact\npathways to improve relevance of innovation\nefforts in the agriculture sector,\n\nDevelop a flexible crop planning and variety\nselection methodology and decisionmaking process based on crop-per-drop\nand economic competitiveness,\n\nDesign and implement program to support\ndemonstration resource efficiency projects\nin the olive cultivation and oil production\nsector,\n\nDevelop and implement pipeline of projects\n(all sizes) and policy recommendations to\nincrease use of aquaponics and hydroponics\nin urban and rural areas,\n\nUpgrade packaging, scaling, storage and\ncooling of fruits and vegetables managed\nby the private sector,\n\nPromote the development of organic\nagriculture through knowledge exchange\nand market development.\n1.

The 14% reduction of GHG emissions\nis divided into two parts. The first part seeks\nto achieve a 1.5% reduction in GHG emissions\nthrough unilateral actions, while the remaining\n12.5% reduction is contingent and conditional\non receiving international financial support. In\nits NDCs, Jordan put the estimate of reducing\nGHG emissions by 14% at USD 5.7 billion. To\nfinance mitigation measures in the energy sector,\nJordan will require USD 5,158 million to meet its\nconditional mitigation targets.\nWhile a significant proportion of this is likely to\ncome from international sources of finance, one\nof the key sectoral actions for the energy sector\nis attracting private sector finance and reducing\nadministrative obstacles in order to enable JREEEF\nto support investments at early stages.\nIn Jordan, the role of the private sector is crucial\nand essential in achieving our NDC, the very\nhigh ratio of (Debt: GDP) makes it difficult for\nthe Government to obtain loans. Therefore, the\ngovernment is considering the role that the\nmobilization of private investment can play a role\nin implementing and achieving our NDC.\nThe key challenges in financing climate change\nprojects are summarized as follows:\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and its\nnegative effects on health, the economy\nand society, it is expected that financial\nsupport from donors will be directed to the\nhealth sector to mitigate the effects of this\npandemic, and this may negatively affect\nthe availability of the required support from\ninternational bodies or public budgets at\nthe national level to implement projects\nto protect the environment in general and\nclimate change projects in particular,\n\nLack of Climate Finance Framework (policy\nor strategy),\n\nBanks in Jordan, in general, are interested in\nproviding finance to RE and EE projects. Banks\nprefer financing RE projects, particularly\nthose which are of a larger size and linked\nto their existing client base. EE and smaller\nsized projects are less preferred,\n\nTo minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity,\n\nThere is a lack of appropriate financial\nproducts,\n\nProject developers lack technical capacity.\nThe work of public financing institutions, such\nas JREEEF and Jordan Environment Fund (JEF),\nalthough small scale, could play a crucial role in\npromoting early stage investments, particularly\nfor public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, and\nfor Projects with co-financing. For JEF to fund\nmitigation activities will require a widening of\nits current role to include a specific focus on\nmitigation activity, and the development of\nproject selection criteria including an assessment\nof projects’ impact on GHG emissions. In addition,\nJEF currently lacks adequate human, technical, and\nfinancial capability to perform its current role, it\nneeds strengthening at various levels to have an\nexpanded role.\nJREEEF now is active and has full and adequate\ninstitutional, technical, and financial capacity to\nmanage the fund, supported by a management\ncommittee, supportive legislation (JREEEF By-\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n114\nLaw), a transparent and effective governance\nstructure, a strategic business plan, and financial\nsupport windows.\nThe majority of financial resources pumped into\nenvironmental sectors in Jordan come from donor\ncountries through bilateral agreements that focus\non fiscal and developmental challenges in the\ncountry. Framework agreements and strategies\nwith major donors like UNDP, United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID),\nUNEP, EU, GIZ, UNIDO, and other agencies have\nbeen developed and they address a variety of\nsustainable development objectives. The donor\ncommunity is supportive of a public registry of\nprojects which would allow transparency and\ncoordination of ongoing activities, as well as the\nassessment of their cost effectiveness. In addition,\nthese donors are particularly supportive of\ndeveloping strong GHG MRV frameworks, believed\nto be key to demonstrating the effectiveness of\nclimate financing (details about the current MRV\ncan be found in section 4). Financial institutions\nand banks are interested in entering this new\nsector. Several green loans and programs are\nbeing established and green suppliers and\nmanufacturers are growing in number. However,\nthe market lacks proactive marketing and public\noutreach.\nPreviously an amount of 112 million JD were\nmade available for RE and EE financing in Jordan;\n76 million JD of the total were made available\nthrough the four commercial banks using the\nCentral Bank of Jordan’s window for RE and EE,\nand 36 million JD was made available through\nthe Agence Français de Development (AFD)\nfacility. This experience was not successful, key\nchallenges in disbursing these funds included\nthe lack of credible market references and short\ncredit history. Another challenge for banks was\nthe lack of sufficient knowledge to verify project\nassumptions, technologies, or risks. They need\naccess to an independent, credible reference\nbody for the accreditation of RE and EE projects.\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps and\nneeds:\n\nExpansion of the framework for the MRV\nsystem for Received Support that addresses\nmost of the above gaps, constraints, and\nneeds by establishing a dedicated entity to\noversee collecting and verifying received\nsupport information related to climate\nchange,\n\nStrengthen the ability to develop bankable\nand evidence-based projects,\n\nIt is recommended to raise the capacities\nof stakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects,\n\nIt is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment,\n\nEnhance the partnership between the public\nand private sector.\n5.6 Financial and Technical Support Provided\nby GEF Related to Climate Change\nGEF supported Jordan financially in executing\nthe following climate change activities during\nthe period 2015-2020:\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s Third National Communication to\nthe UNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv, 20122015,\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report to the\nUNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv, 2015-2017,\n\nMainstreaming Rio Convention into National\nSectoral Polices, 2015-2018,\n\nA systematic approach to Sustainable\nUrbanization and Resource Efficiency (SURE)\nin GAM, 2018-2022,\n\nEnabling Activities for the Preparation of\nJordan’s Fourth National Communication\nand Second Biennial Update Report to\nthe UNFCCC, implemented by MoEnv,\n2019-present.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n115\nThe above projects have been implemented with\nUNDP support, and with technical support from\nother United Nations organizations including\nUNEP and UNFCCC. In addition, the UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Program (GSP) have provided\ntechnical support for the preparation of Jordan’s\nNational Communications and the FBUR on climate\nchange through training workshops, provision\nof guidelines and guidance materials, review of\nstudies and reports and provision of online support\nand teleconference calls.\nReferences\n\nAccess to Finance: Survey for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, USAID, 2015.\n\nBuilding Capacity for the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework: What Can We\nLearn from Countries’ Experiences and UNFCCC Processes?

Also,\nnon-Annex I Parties should provide updated\ninformation on financial resources, technology\ntransfer, capacity building, and technical support\nreceived from the Global Environment Facility.\nWith regard to the development and transfer of\ntechnology, non-Annex I Parties should provide\ninformation on technology needs, which must\nbe nationally determined, and on technology\nsupport received.\nThe data on support received and financial flows\nwas requested through traditional channels by\nsending official letters and formal emails and\nfollow up calls by the Ministry of Environment to all\nrelevant entities (public and private organizations,\nUN agencies, etc.)\nImprovement was witnessed in collecting\nthe needed data due to the increased level of\nengagement of the national entities in the national\nclimate change profile over the last 2 years, and\ndue to the issuance of the Climate Change Bylaw\nin 2019, which helped to institutionalize and\nstrengthen the cooperation between relevant\nentities.\nNevertheless, there is still a need for wellestablished systems for tracking data and a\nwell-defined process for the data flow from these\norganizations into the MRV system. To date some\ndata are still present only at one entity and can’t be\ntracked from other sources (the same difficulties\nas in the First BUR of 2017).\nThe Tables below (6.1-6.7) provide information\non the support received from national, bilateral,\nand multilateral sources for the period 2015-2020\nincluding funding, technology transfer, capacity\nbuilding, and technical assistance.
