Other gases\nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, such\nas sulphur oxides (SOx), included in the IPCC\nGuidelines may be included at the discretion\nof the Parties.\nThe national GHG emissions were estimated\nfor the years 2010 and 2012 using the 2006\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) Guidelines and Software for Parties not\nincluded in Annex I of the UNFCCC.\nAll sector and subsector national experts used\nTier 1, since the current version of the software\nsupports only Tier 1. The sectors and subsectors\nthat were considered are the following:\n1. Energy:\nn\nn Stationary Combustion\nn\nn Mobile Combustion\nn\nn Fugitive Emissions\n2. Industrial Processes and Product Use\n(IPPU):\nn\nn Mineral Industry Emissions\nn\nn Chemical Industry Emissions\nn\nn Metal Industry Emissions\nn\nn Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent\nUse\nn\nn Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for\nOzone Depleting Substances and Other\nProduct Manufacture and Use\n3. Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU):\nn\nn Cropland and Forest Land\nn\nn Emissions from Livestock and Manure\nManagement\nn\nn N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2\nEmissions from Lime and Urea Application\n4. Waste Generation, Composition, and\nManagement Data\nn\nn Solid Waste Disposal\nn\nn Biological Treatment of Solid Waste\nn\nn Incineration and Open Burning of Waste\nn\nn Wastewater Treatment and Discharge\nThis chapter addresses emissions of carbon\ndioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4),\nsulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons\n(HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Those gases\nare supported by the software and the IPCC\n2006 Guidelines. Non-methane volatile organic\ncompounds (NMVOCs) emissions resulting from\nthe solvents subsector were estimated using\nEMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory\nguidebook 2013.\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n29\n2.2 Institutional Arrangements\nThe Ministry of Environment is the focal point for\nissues relevant to the UNFCCC and is responsible\nfor seeing that Jordan’s commitments are met.\nPreparation of Jordan’s FBUR was coordinated by\nthe Ministry of Environment in partnership with\nUNDP. An agreement with the Royal Scientific\nSociety (a national non-governmental, nonfor-profit organization for applied research)\nwas realized to achieve the work. The GHG\ninventory development was accomplished with\nthe participation of a pool of national experts\nrepresenting different national entities, as\ndemonstrated by the organizational chart in\nFigure 2.1.\nFigure 2.1: Organizational chart for national GHG inventory development\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n30\nIn addition to guidance on appropriate estimation\nmethods, the 2006 Guidelines include crosssectoral good practice guidance for inventory\npreparation. This includes collection of activity\ndata, key category analysis, quality assurance\nand control, and inventory planning and\ndocumentation.\nSince the IPCC Guidelines are intended to be\nused by all countries with different capacities,\nthey provide different tiers of methods for each\ncategory of emission source or removal category.\nThe higher tier methods (Tier 3 being the highest)\nare typically more detailed, data intensive, and\nrely on country-specific parameters to estimate\nemissions. In contrast, Tier 1 methods utilize more\naggregated data and default emission factors. The\n2006 IPCC Guidelines provide methodologies\nfor estimating national GHG inventories of\nanthropogenic emissions by sources and removals\nby sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by\nthe Montreal Protocol. The 2006 Guidelines are of\nfive volumes. Volume 1 describes the basic steps\nin inventory development and offers general\nguidance in estimating greenhouse gas emissions\nand removals. Volumes 2 through 5 offer guidance\nin making estimates for different sectors of an\neconomy.\n2.3 Methodology and Inventory\nEstimation\nThe IPCC Greenhouse Gas Guidelines provide\ndetailed methods for estimating GHG emissions\nby sources and removals by sinks. The 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines is an update of and was synthesized\nfrom the Revised 1996 Guidelines, Good Practice\nGuidance and Uncertainty Management in\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Good\nPractice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change,\nand Forestry.\nThere are some structural changes in the 2006\nGuidelines, such as combining the previously\nseparate Agriculture and Land-Use, Land-Use\nand Forestry (LULUCF) sectors into one sector, as\nshown in Figure 2.2. It is worth noting that the\ninventory methods in the 2006 Guidelines are just\nan update of the previous editions with additional\nsources and some new default emission factors.\nFigure 2.2: Structural differences between Revised 1996 and 2006 IPCC Guidelines\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n31\nTable 2.1: GHG net emissions by sector, 2010\nCategories\nEmissions\nCO2 Equivalents (Gg)\nPercentage of the\noverall\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n23140.06\n100%\nEnergy\n19410.88\n84%\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use\n1982.04\n9%\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n180.50\n1%\nWaste\n1567.49\n7%\nIn preparing Jordan’s FBUR inventories, the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines and the IPCC Software (versions\n2.16 and 2.17) were used.\nNational inventories for years 2010 and 2012 were\nestimated. And as per the guidelines, four sectors\nwere considered, namely, Energy, Industrial\nProcesses and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture,\nForestry, and other Land Use (AFOLU), and Waste.\n Inventories were prepared on a gas-by-gas basis\nand in units of mass. Estimates of anthropogenic\nemissions of the direct GHGs of carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were\nassessed by sources and removals by sinks.\nNot all indirect GHGs were estimated. To\nimprove completeness of emission estimates, it\nis recommended to estimate them in the future\nby using the EEA Guidelines and methodology.\nFor reporting purposes, the notation keys NO\n(not occurring) or NE (not estimated) and NA\n(not applicable) were used as necessary in the\ninventory reporting tables.\nEmissions were estimated in Gigagrams (Gg) for\nall direct and indirect gases, as well as in Gg of\nCO2-equivalent (CO2eq) for all direct gases. For\nthe conversion from Gg of different GHGs to Gg of\nCO2eq, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values\nprovided in the IPCC SAR (temporal horizon 100\nyears) were used (as per Decision 17/CP.8).\nThe following sections report Jordan’s GHG\ninventories by sector and on a gas by gas basis.\n2.4 GHG Inventories by Sector\nAccording to the overall GHG Inventory estimates,\nJordan contributed 23140.06 Gg of CO2-equivalent\n(CO2eq) in 2010. A breakdown of Jordan’s total\nemissions of GHGs by sector indicated that the\nEnergy Sector is the major emitter accounting for\n84% of total national emissions followed by the\nIndustrial Sector with a contribution of 9%. GHG\nemissions by sector in 2010 are shown in Table\n2.1 and Figure 2.3.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n32\nFigure 2.3: GHG net emissions (%) by sector, 2010\nIn 2012, Jordan contributed 27997.73 Gigagrams (Gg) of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq). A breakdown of Jordan’s\ntotal emissions of GHGs by sector indicated that the energy sector was the major emitter capturing\n81% of total national emissions followed by the industrial sector with a contribution of 12%. The 2012\nGHG emissions by sector are shown in Table 2.2 and Figure 2.4.\nTable 2.2: GHG net emissions by sector, 2012\nCategories\nEmissions\nCO2 Equivalents (Gg)\nPercentage\nof the overall\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n27997.73\n100%\nEnergy\n22756.83\n 81%\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use\n3368.47\n12%\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n237.29\n1%\nWaste\n1635.14\n6%\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n33\nIn the below sections, a detailed description is\ngiven for the emissions resulting from the sectors\nin years 2010 and 2012.\n2.4.1 Energy sector\nJordan has limited indigenous energy resources,\nleaving the country heavily dependent on energy\nimports to meet a growing demand, expected to\ndouble to a forecasted 15.08 million tons of oil\nequivalent (Mtoe) by 2020 from 7.357 Mtoe in 2010\nand 8.205 Mtoe in 2012. Moreover, rapid economic\ngrowth, population growth, and the successive\ninflux of refugees over the last decade have all\nimposed additional demands on energy resources.\nThe costs of energy imports have increased as\nhas the risk of interruptions in energy supplies.\nThis has spurred governmental action to improve\nenergy efficiency and search for additional energy\nresources.\nJordan imports 97% of its oil and gas, accounting\nfor almost 18% of the 2014 gross domestic product\n(GDP). This has made the country completely\nvulnerable to fluctuations in the global energy\nmarket. The current energy strategy is to transform\nthe energy mix from one heavily reliant on oil and\nnatural gas to one more balanced with a higher\nproportion of energy supplied by renewable\nsources.\nEnergy-related activities have a dominant share\nof GHG emissions in Jordan. Emissions from this\nsector are classified into two main categories:\nn\nn Emissions from fuel combustion, and\nn\nn Non-combustion (fugitive) emissions.\n2.4.1.1 GHG emissions in 2010\nTotal emissions from the energy sector were\n19410.88 Gg of CO2eq in 2010, resulting primarily\nfrom fuel combustion activities, as shown in Table\n2.3. Fugitive emissions (from oil and natural gas)\nwere negligible.\nFigure 2.4: GHG net emissions (%) by sector, 2012\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n34\nTable 2.3: Energy sector net emissions, 2010\nCategories\nNet CO2\nCH4\nN2O\nNet Gg of\nCO2eq\n(Gg of CO2eq)\nENERGY SECTOR\n19260.38\n48.48\n102.02\n19410.88\nFuel Combustion Activities\n19259.93\n47.67\n102.01\n19409.61\nEnergy Industries\n9096.06\n5.00\n11.72\n9112.78\nManufacturing Industries and Construction\n2298.74\n1.93\n5.69\n2306.36\nTransport\n5182.71\n34.26\n79.83\n5296.81\nOther Sectors (Residential, Commercial, and\nAgriculture)\n2266.68\n5.39\n3.90\n2275.97\nNon-Specified\n415.74\n1.08\n0.88\n417.70\nFugitive Emissions (Oil and Natural Gas)\n0.45\n0.82\n0.0009\n1.26\nFigure 2.5: Shares of emission (%) per subsector within the energy sector, 2010\nWithin the fuel combustion activities, major\nemissions resulted from the Energy Industries\nand Transport subsectors with a share of 47%\nand 27% respectively.

The sector has also contributed directly and\nindirectly for 40% of GDP through linkages with\nother key sectors such as transport, insurance,\nand trade.\nThe industrial sector consists of two subsectors,\nmanufacturing and mining. The manufacturing\n(converting) subsector includes chemicals,\nelectrical, engineering and construction, food\nand beverages, glass and ceramic, tobacco and\ncigarettes, paper and cartoon, pharmaceuticals\nand medical, printing and packaging, and textile\nand leathers. The mining subsector includes\nphosphate, potash, salt, carbonate, lime and\nlimestone, fertilizers, cement and construction\nmaterials.

It has a\nland area of about 89 200 km2 and is rated among\nthe world’s most water poor countries.\nNatural ecosystems in Jordan support human\nactivities in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,\ntourism, traditional and pharmaceutical health\nproducts, and traditional medicine, among\nothers. According to the Ministry of Agriculture\n2007 survey, less than 5% of the country’s total\narea is arable land while grazing land makes up\n90% with 100–200 mm of annual rainfall. Natural\nand human-made forests cover around 1% of the\ncountry’s total area. The number of farm holdings\nis 80,000, at an average area of 40 dunum per\nholding (56,000 are plant production holdings\nand 14,000 are animal production holdings). Plant\nproduction holdings are mostly field crops, olives,\nfruit trees, and vegetables.\nThe contribution of agriculture to GDP in relative\nterms declined sharply from 40% in the 1950s\nto 4% in 2016. Irrespective of how humble the\ncontribution of agriculture is to national GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of agriculture stems\nfrom the fact that it is not only a major source\nof food, in particular dairy products, fruits, and\nvegetables, but it is also a source of livelihood\nfor 25% of the total poor population (livestock\nkeepers, smallholder farm households, and\nlandless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas.\nTable 2.10: Emissions of the mineral industry, 2012\nCategories\nCO2eq (Gg)\nMINERAL INDUSTRY\n1531.31\nCement production\n1162.50\nLime production\n8.47\nOther Process Uses of Carbonates\n360.33\nFigure 2.10: Shares of emission (%) per subsector within the mineral industry subsector, 2012\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n41\nTable 2.11: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2010\nCategories\nNet CO2\n(Gg)\nCH4-\nCO2eq\n(Gg)\nN2O-\nCO2eq\n(Gg)\nNet\nCO2eq\n(Gg)\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\n-263.89\n439.41\n4.97\n180.50\nLivestock\nNA\n439.11\n2.15\n441.26\nLand\n-274.56\nNA\nNA\n-274.56\nAggregate sources and non-CO2 emissions\nsources on land\n10.67\n0.298\n2.82\n13.80\nFigure 2.11: Emissions of the AFOLU sector, 2010\n2.4.3.1 GHG emissions in 2010\nthe most significant change made in the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines compared with the Revised\n1996 IPCC and GPG 2000 was in this sector.

The emissions were composed of methane\nand nitrous oxide and were generated by various\nsubcategories.

The main responsible entities are the\nMinistry of Municipal Affairs, the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Greater Amman Municipality, and\nthe Special Economic Zones of Aqaba and Petra.\nSolid waste management is a major challenge in\nurban and rural areas, the concern for safe and\neffective SWM has been steadily increasing in\nJordan, due to the political, demographic and\neconomic conditions as well as the large numbers\nof refugees. The Kingdom lacks integrated\npractices for the collection, transportation,\ntransfer, treatment, and disposal of MSW. While the\nexisting municipal solid waste collection system\nis considered to be adequate in urban centers,\nservices tend to be poor or non-existent in small\ntowns and rural areas. Municipal and industrial\nsolid waste is primarily dumped at landfills. At\npresent, there are 18 official dumpsites in Jordan,\nmost of which are not properly designed or\noperated, demonstrated by their lack of proper\nlining, leachate collection system, or LFG (landfill\ngas) management system. Al-Ghabawi is the only\nsanitary landfill in Jordan.\nIn terms of wastewater management, Jordan\noperated its first sewage collection system in\nAmman in the late 1960s. The system was meant\nto collect wastewater and dispose of it either in\nliquid dumps or randomly in Wadis. The system\nhad adverse impacts on water resources and\nthe environment, leading to the construction of\nthe first wastewater treatment plant in Jordan\nat Ain Gazal in 1968. The government has since\nexpanded the construction of wastewater\ntreatment plants to increase coverage across\nJordan. As of 2016, the country has 33 public\nworking wastewater treatment plants that are\neither operated by the Water Authority of Jordan\n(WAJ) or controlled by the Project Management\nUnit (PMU) at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation.\nSamra Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)\nreceives more than 70% of wastewater diverted\nto WWTPs while Mansourah WWTP for septic tanks\nreceives around 0.005% of the total wastewater\ndischarged in 2012. The Jordan water strategy\n2016-2025 considered treated wastewater as a\nsource of water to replace part of good quality\nwater for agricultural purposes. In 2013, amount\nof treated wastewater exceeded 120 MCM and\ncurrently wastewater treatment plants serve most\nof the urban areas in the country.\n2.4.4.1 GHG emissions in 2010\nIn 2010, GHG emissions from the waste sector\nreached 1567.49 Gg of CO2eq, accounting for\n7% of Jordan’s total GHG emissions. Most of the\nemissions were generated by domestic solid waste\ndisposal, which accounted for 89% (1391.77 Gg of\nCO2eq) of total waste emissions, while wastewater\nhandling accounted for 11% (171.67 Gg of CO2eq)\nof total waste emissions.

It was expected for\nGHG emissions to grow with population growth\nand increased economic activities. However, this\nwas not the case. As shown in table 2.23, total\nnational GHG emissions were 28.71, 23.14, and\n27.99 Million Ton of CO2eq in 2006, 2010, and 2012,\nrespectively. These trends can be explained by\nthe following:\nn\nn The current inventories were estimated\nusing the 2006 IPCC Guidelines whereas the\nprevious inventory of the TNC was estimated\nusing the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The\ntwo guidelines vary in their use of emission\nfactors and additional sources.\nn\nn The energy sector emissions were affected\nby the interruption of the natural gas supply\nfrom Egypt, forcing Jordan to switch to the\nuse of more carbon intensive fuels such as\nheavy fuel oil (HFO).\nn\nn A significant change was made concerning\nland use classifications in the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines compared with the Revised 1996\nIPCC and GPG 2000. The 2006 Guidelines have\ncombined the approach of Land Use, LandUse Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) in GPG\nLULUCF and the Agriculture sector in GPG\n2000 into a single Agriculture, Forestry, and\nOther Land Use (AFOLU). This change has\naffected the results.\nn\nn The solid waste module was affected by\nchanges as well. The 2006 IPCC methodology\nfor estimating CH4 emissions from solid\nwaste is based on the First Order Decay\n(FOD) method while the Revised 1996 IPCC\nGuidelines is based on the mass balance\nmethod. The FOD method assumes that the\ndegradable organic carbon in waste decays\nslowly throughout a few decades, during\nwhich CH4 and CO2 are formed. As a result,\nemissions of CH4 from waste deposited in a\ndisposal site are highest in the first few years\nafter deposition, after which they gradually\ndecline, whereas the mass balance method\nassumes all emissions are produced in the\nfirst year of deposition.\nn\nn The phasing out of ODS in 2012, such as\nR-22 (that has no contribution to climate\nchange) and replacing it with HFCs (such as\nR-134a) that have high GWP had an impact\non increasing the overall results of the IPPU\nmodule in 2012.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n60\n2.8 Reference Approach\nThe Reference Approach and the Sectoral\nApproach often yield different results because\nthe Reference Approach is a top-down approach\nusing the country’s energy supply data and has\nno detailed information on how the individual\nfuels are used in each sector. This approach\nprovides estimates of CO2 to compare with\nestimates derived using a Sectoral Approach. The\nReference Approach provides an upper bound\nto the Sectoral Approach ‘1A Fuel Combustion’,\nbecause some of the carbon in the fuel is not\ncombusted but is released as fugitive emissions\n(as leakage or evaporation in the production\nand/or transformation stage). Calculating CO2\nemissions with the two approaches can lead to\ndifferent results for some countries.\nThe Reference Approach was used to calculate\nenergy sector emissions in 2010 and 2012 and the\nresults were compared to those of the Sectoral\nApproach. The gap between the two approaches\nis supposed to be relatively small (5% or less). For\nJordan, the calculated differences were acceptable;\nnot more than 2%, as indicated in Table 2.24 and\nFigure 2.19.\nTable 2.23: Comparison between national GHG inventories 2006, 2010 and 2012\nCategories\nRevised 1996 IPCC\n2006 IPCC Guidelines\nYear 2006 (TNC)\nYear 2010\nYear 2012\nCO2 eq (Gg)\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n28717\n23140.06\n27997.73\n1 - Energy\n20938\n19410.88\n22756.83\n2 - Industrial Processes and Product Use\n2550\n1982.04\n3368.47\n3 - Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use\nAgriculture 1318\nLULUCF 866\n180.50\n237.29\n4 - Waste\n3045\n1567.49\n1635.14\nMemo Items (5)\nInternational Bunkers\n748\n994.75\n1024.37\n 1.A.3.a.i - International Aviation\n(International Bunkers)\n748\n941.86\n967.65\n 1.A.3.d.i - International Water-borne\nNavigation (International bunkers)\nNE\n52.89\n56.69\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n61\nGHG emissions were also estimated using the Reference Approach for the time series (2007-2012) and\nyielded a harmonized trend of emissions as shown in Table 2.25 and Figure 2.20.\nTable 2.25: Reference approach for time series (2007-2012)\nyear\nEnergy Consumption (TJ)\nCO2 (Gg)\n2007\n281336.32\n19077.83\n2008\n270707.89\n18160.63\n2009\n279999.32\n18605.04\n2010\n290308.49\n19479.65\n2011\n285718.7\n20403.51\n2012\n320408.08\n23010.29\nTable 2.24: Reference approach vs sectoral approach, 2010 and 2012\nyear\nReference Approach CO2 Emissions (Gg)\nSectoral CO2 Emissions (Gg)\nDifference\n2010\n19479.65\n19259.93\n1.14%\n2012\n23010.29\n22557.98\n2%\nFigure 2.19: Reference approach vs sectoral approach, 2010 and 2012\n24000\n23000\n22000\n21000\n20000\n19000\n18000\n17000\n2010\n2012\nCO2 Emissions (Gg )\nReference Approach\nemissions\nSectoral emissions\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n62\n2.9 Key Category Analysis\nThe key category analysis is an essential element\nfor inventory development and a driving factor\nto improve its quality. Non-Annex I Parties are\nencouraged (Decision 17/CP.8), to the extent\npossible, to undertake any key category analysis\nto assist in developing inventories that better\nreflect their national circumstances. The analysis\nwas carried out based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines\nand Software. Jordan used “level” key category\nanalysis where the contribution of each source\nor sink category to the total national inventory\nlevel was calculated. The Key categories according\nto the guidelines are those that, when summed\ntogether in descending order of magnitude, add\nup to 95% of the sum of all level assessment.\nIn categories that are identified as key, Parties\nshould try to use a recommended method, in\naccordance with the corresponding decision tree\nin the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It is recommended\nthat Jordan searches for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to the\nextent possible and based on software readiness\nand national circumstances, Tier 2 methods in the\ncategories identified as key.\nIn the total national GHG emissions of 2010,\nvarious Fuel Combustion Activities subcategories\nwere among the top five sources accounting for\naround 66% of all emissions, mainly: Energy\nIndustries (Gaseous Fuels), Road Transportation,\nEnergy Industries (Liquid Fuels), Manufacturing\nIndustries and Construction (Liquid Fuels) and\nother sectors (commercial/institutional and\nresidential-Liquid Fuels). The IPPU, AFOLU, and\nwaste subsectors accounted for the balance, as\nshown in Table 2.26.\nFigure 2.20: Reference approach for time series (2007-2012)\n\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n63\nTable 2.26: Key category analysis (level assessment), 2010\nA\nB\nC\nD\nF\nG\nIPCC\nCategory\ncode\nIPCC Category\nGreenhouse\nGas\n2010\nEmissions\nCO2eq (Gg)\n2010\nEmissions\nLevel from\nthe Given\nCategory\nCumulative\nTotal % of\nColumn F\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nGaseous Fuels\nCO2\n5345.70\n0.187\n19%\n1.A.3.b\nRoad Transportation\nCO2\n5156.63\n0.180\n37%\n1.A.1\nEnergy Industries -\nLiquid Fuels\nCO2\n3750.36\n0.131\n50%\n1.A.2\nManufacturing\nIndustries and\nConstruction - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2298.74\n0.080\n58%\n1.A.4\nOther Sectors - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n2266.68\n0.079\n66%\n4.A\nSolid Waste Disposal\nCH4\n1391.77\n0.072\n74%\n2.A.1\nCement Production\nCO2\n1038\n0.051\n81%\n2.D\nNon-Energy Products\nfrom Fuels and\nSolvent Use\nCO2\n467.68\n0.049\n86%\n1.A.5\nNon-Specified - Liquid\nFuels\nCO2\n415.74\n0.028\n89%\n3.A.1\nEnteric Fermentation\nCH4\n408.85\n0.016\n91%\n2.F.1\nRefrigeration and Air\nConditioning\nHFCs, PFCs\n335.91\n0.015\n92%\n3.B.1.a\nForest land Remaining\nForest land\nCO2\n-274.78\n0.014\n93%\n2.A.4\nOther Process Uses of\nCarbonates\nCO2\n165.60\n0.010\n94%\n2.B.2\nNitric Acid Production\nN2O\n151.34\n0.006\n95%\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n64\nWhereas in the total national GHG emissions\nof 2012, various Fuel Combustion Activities\nsubcategories were among the top four sources\naccounting for around 73% of all emissions,\nmainly: Energy Industries (Liquid Fuels), Road\nTransportation, other sectors (Liquid Fuels)\nand Energy Industries (Gaseous Fuels). Energy\nIndustries (Gaseous Fuels) moved down from the\nfirst place to the fourth place in 2012 compared\nto 2010 list due to the decrease in Egyptian\nGas supply.

Uncertainty\ninformation is intended to help prioritize efforts\nto improve the accuracy of inventories and guide\ndecisions on the methodological choice.\nThe analysis was carried out based on IPCC\n2006 Guidelines and Software. “Approach 1:\nPropagation of Error” was used. Approach 1 is\nbased upon error propagation and is used to\nestimate uncertainty in individual categories in\nthe inventory as a whole, and in trends between\n2012 and the base year 2010. The uncertainty\nanalysis was based on Tier 1 approach and covers\nall source-categories and all direct greenhouse\ngases. The uncertainty estimation for the activity\ndata and emission factors was based on typical\nvalues of the IPCC.\nThe results indicate that net emissions in 2012\nwere 34575.36 Gg of CO2eq with an uncertainty\nof ±5%, which corresponds to a 95% probability\nrange of 26737.83 to 29257.63 Gg of CO2eq. Based\nupon the total base year of 2010 and year 2012\ninventories, the average trend is a 21% increase\nin emissions from 2010 to 2012. The uncertainty\nin the trend is ±6% (percentage points), which\ncorresponds to a 95% probability range for the\ntrend of 26% to 38% with respect to base year\nemissions.\n2.11 GHG Inventory Review\nThe national GHG inventory was subjected to two\nlevels of review, as follows:\nn\nn An internal review was performed by the RSS\nproject management team throughout the\nlifetime of the project. The review covered all\nsectoral reports and changes that have been\nintroduced to the reports as new versions.\nn\nn An international review was coordinated by\nthe UNDP-UNEP Global Support Program\n(GSP) and was conducted in June 25-28,\n2017, by a consultant expert in national\nGHG emissions inventories. This was based\non the indications included in Annex III to\nDecision 2/CP.17 (UNFCCC, 2011) and the\nIPCC Guidelines and guidance required in\nthis decision to be used for the non-Annex\nI Parties to present biennial update reports\n(BURs) to the Convention.\nReferences\nn\nn 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse\nGas Inventories.\nn\nn EEA, 2016.

The\nsectors considered for their mitigation potential\nin this report are those that were addressed in\nthe Third National Communication (TNC), namely,\nenergy (primary energy, renewable energy,\nenergy efficiency and transport), waste, industrial\nprocesses, and agriculture, forestry, and other land\nuse (AFOLU).\nFor this purpose, two updated scenarios were\nconstructed; baseline and mitigation scenarios:\nn\nn The baseline scenario reflects a future in which\nthere are no policies or programs designed to\nencourage or require actions that reduce GHG\nemissions or enhance carbon sinks. Defining\na reasonable baseline scenario is considered a\ncritical element in the abatement assessment\nsince the benefits and incremental costs of\nmitigation options are directly linked to the\nsound definition of the baseline scenario. The\nupdated baseline scenario in this chapter was\nconstructed based on the trends, plans and\npolicies prevailing in the Jordanian context\nduring the time of preparation of this chapter\n(2016 and 2017). The development of this\nscenario required a projection of the current\nlevels to future levels of each type of activity\nfor the interval 2015-2040. Such projection\ndrew on assumptions made about population\ngrowth, GDP, and other macro variables, which\nwere obtained from official institutions.\nn\nn\nn\nn The mitigation scenario in the TNC was\nstructured according to a set of criteria\nreflecting country-specific conditions such\nas the potential for significant impact on\ngreenhouse gas emissions, direct and\nindirect economic impacts, consistency with\nnational development goals, the potential\neffectiveness of implementation policies,\nsustainability of an option, data availability for\nevaluation, and other sector-specific criteria.\nIn this chapter, the mitigation scenario is\nupdated in terms of mitigation options status.\nAll mitigation options that became part of\nthe baseline scenario or became invalid were\nremoved from the current scenario, while all\nother remaining mitigation options were\ncounted in after adjustments were made in\ntheir expected implementation timeline and\nin their associated GHG emission reductions.\nSome newly identified options were added as\nwell to the current mitigation scenario.\nThe overall baseline and mitigation scenarios\nare constructed to cover the period 2015-2040.\nThe analytical methodology of the energy sector\nis based on the LEAP Model, the Long-Range\nEnergy Alternative Planning System. LEAP is an\nintegrated modelling tool developed to track\nenergy consumption, production, and resource\nextraction in all sectors of an economy. In addition\nto tracking GHGs, LEAP can also be used to analyze\nemissions of local and regional air pollutants,\nmaking it well-suited to studies of the climate\nco-benefits of local air pollution reduction. The\nLEAP tool is used for the first time in Jordan in\nthe energy mitigation analysis. In former national\ncommunications to the UNFCCC, the Energy and\nPower Evaluation Program (ENPEP) was used.\nThe energy baseline scenario delineates 2015 as\na base year and considers the policies, programs,\nand projects that have been incorporated in the\nenergy strategy for 2015-2025 as committed and\nconfirmed inputs for building up the baseline\nscenario up to 2040 using the LEAP Model. For nonenergy sectors (IPPU, AFOLU, and Waste), linkages\nto demographic, macroeconomic, and other sector\nspecific factors were used to build up the scenario\nutilizing statistical and economic tools.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n69\n3.2 Importance of TNC Update\nSince submission of the TNC to the UNFCCC in\nNovember 2014, new developments have affected\nthe national economy and social conditions. This\ngives added importance to the need to update\nthe mitigation analysis for all sectors. The major\nchanges that took place in 2015 and 2016, can be\nsummarized as follows:\nIn 2015, “Jordan 2025” was launched and adopted\nas a national strategy. The document articulated\na vision for promoting the rule of law, upholding\nequal opportunity, increasing participatory\npolicy making, achieving fiscal sustainability, and\nstrengthening institutions. The Jordan 2025 vision\naspires to achieve real economic growth rates of\n7.5% in 2025, at an annual rate of 5.7% within the\nvision period. The energy sector was one of the\nmain sectors addressed in the document aiming at\nsecuring Jordan’s sustainable development efforts.\nA new census was conducted and published in\nDecember 2015, the main findings were:\nn\nn The population of Jordan was 9,531,712\n(compared to 6.9 million used in the TNC\nbaseline scenario for 2015).\nn\nn The population doubled more than 10 times\nover the past 55 years; most of the increase\ntook place during the past decade, especially\nafter 2011 due of influxes of refugees.\nn\nn The population of those of Jordanian origin\nwas 6,613,587 accounting for 69.4% of the\ntotal population.\nn\nn Non-Jordanian population made up 30% of\nthe total population. Almost half of them\nare Syrians (1.3 million) and one third of\nthem (about 436 thousand) live in Amman\nGovernorate.\nn\nn The population of Amman Governorate\nexceeded 4 million.\nA new energy strategy for the period 2015-2025\nwas prepared and approved in December 2015.\nThe strategy provided a plan for the future energy\nmix, particularly for electricity generation, and\nthe consequences of increasing the generating\ncapacity of renewable sources of energy on the\nelectricity generation and transmission system\nand on the share of nuclear energy in electricity\ngeneration. Additional energy relevant changes\nwill be outlined under the energy baseline section\nof this chapter.\n3.3 Sources of Data and the Main\nMacroeconomic and Demographic\nConsiderations\nThe main macroeconomic data considered for\nthe baseline scenario were obtained from official\nsources as follows:\nn\nn Economic Growth Rate: The economic\ngrowth rate or the gross domestic product\n(GDP) considered in the baseline scenario is\nconsistent with that targeted in “Jordan 2025:\na National Vision and Strategy”, which seeks to\nachieve a real economic growth rate of 7.5%\nin 2025 at an annual growth rate of 5.7%.\nn\nn The value-added figures considered for the\neconomic sectors were those that are stated\nin “Jordan 2025”.\nn\nn Population figures for Jordanians and nonJordanians and family size data were based\non the findings of the census of 2015, while\npopulation growth rates for Jordanians and\nnon-Jordanians were obtained from the\nDepartment of Statistics-Jordan.\nn\nn The official discount rate used was 8%, as\ndetermined by the Ministry of Planning and\nInternational Cooperation.\nn\nn Historical energy data for 2013- 2015 were\nobtained from the energy balances issued by\nthe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources\n(MEMR) for 2013, 2014, and 2015, which\nillustrate the energy flow from the supply side,\ntransformation and into the demand side.\nn\nn Detailed\ndata\nfor\nhistorical\nenergy\nconsumption patterns by each sector and for\nthe technologies used for 2013- 2015 were\nobtained from the energy surveys conducted\nby MEMR as follows:\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n70\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the transport sector, 2012.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the household sector, 2013.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the services sector, 2014.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the agricultural sector, 2014.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the commercial sector, 2013.\n-\tEnergy consumption survey in the industrial sector, 2013.\nTable 3.1 shows the economic growth rate of GDP in real terms, the structural composition of GDP, and\nthe growth rate (GR) of population.\nTable 3.1: GDP and population, 2015-2040\nItem\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nPopulation (million)*\n9.531\nJordanian (%GR) *\n6.613\n2.9\n2.7\n2.3\n2.0\n1.9\nNon-Jordanian (%GR)\n2.918\n2.4\n2.2\n1.8\n1.5\n1.5\nGDP (million JD) **\n26640\n34790\n46510\n62820\n80150\n102300\nGDP (%GR) **\n3.1\n4.91\n7.53\n6.2\n5.0\n5.0\nStructural Composition of GDP (Value Added) %\nServices Sector\n68.1\n61.4\n58\n52\n50\n48\nIndustrial Sector\n22.4\n27.4\n29.5\n32\n33\n34\nConstruction Sector\n4.2\n5.8\n6.6\n8\n8.8\n9.8\nAgricultural Sector\n2.9\n3.4\n4.1\n5.9\n6.0\n6.0\nNon-Profit Organization\n2.4\n2.0\n1.8\n2.1\n2.2\n2.2\n*Department of Statistics\n**Jordan Vision 2025\nNon-Jordanians are comprised of three major\ngroups. The first group is made up of Syrians\nwho entered Jordan during the 1984-1986\nSyrian conflict and stayed in Jordan to this date.\nThe size of this first group is 700,000 (2015).\nThis first group is regarded as Jordanian for the\npurpose of calculating population growth rates.\nThe second group is made up of Syrian refugees\nwho entered Jordan during 2011-2016 Syrian\nconflict with an estimated size of 630,000. The\npresence of this second group is driven by the\npolitical and security situation in Syria. The third\ngroup is Egyptian workers, whose stay is driven\nby economic considerations and regulated by\ngovernment labor policies.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n71\n3.4 Baseline Scenario for the\nDifferent Sectors\n3.4.1 Baseline scenario for the energy\nsector\n3.4.1.1 Updates on TNC baseline\nscenario\na. Energy Demand and Supply Updates\nn\nn Throughout the period 2011-2014, the energy\nsector has experienced several setbacks\ncaused by the rise, at the time, in the price of\ncrude oil and oil derivatives, the interruption\nof the Egyptian gas supply, and the shift to\nmore expensive fuel for electricity generation.\nAnd with a rise in the demand for electricity\nduring the same period from 2.8% and 6.4%\nin 2011 and 2014, respectively, energy imports\nhave reached 4.1 billion JD in 2013 and 4.5\nbillion JD in 2014, an increase of around 10%.\nn\nn One of the main drivers behind the high\ngrowth rate in the demand for energy and\nelectricity is the presence of 1.3 million\nSyrian refugees comprising 20% of Jordan’s\npopulation and to whom Jordan is obliged to\nprovide essential water and energy services.\nn\nn In 2015, the energy sector was affected by the\nfall in crude oil prices in the global market to\nUSD 30 per barrel. This decrease led to delays\nin implementing many infrastructure energy\nprojects listed in the TNC baseline scenario.\nn\nn The liquefied natural gas (LNG) jetty in Aqaba\nwas put in operation in September 2015,\nallowing Jordan to meet the country’s needs\nof LNG for electricity generation. Concurrently,\ngovernment electricity subsidies for the\nelectricity generation sector were phased out.\nn\nn As a result, the heavy burden on Jordan’s\neconomy has been decreased. Government\nenergy expenditures in 2015 were 2.5 billion\nJD, equal to 13% of GDP, compared to 4.5\nbillion JD in 2014 (18% of GDP).\nb. Delayed energy infrastructure projects\nlisted in the TNC baseline scenario\nn\nn Oil shale projects for electricity generation:\nConstruction of an oil shale 470 MW power\nplant to generate electricity via direct burning\nwas considerably delayed because of a failure\nin reaching a financial closure. The new\nexpected date for commercial operation has\nmoved to 2020. In addition, the construction\nof another oil shale 600 MW power plant by a\nconsortium of Emirati and Chinese companies\nwas cancelled. Consequently, achieving the\n11% target for oil shale contribution in the\nenergy mix by 2020 is no longer attainable.\nThe updated share of oil shale in the energy\nmix will be up to 8% by 2025.\nn\nn Oil shale surface restoration projects: Change\nin the economic feasibility have affected\nthe ability of companies working in surface\nrestoration of oil shale fields to fulfill their\nagreed-upon obligations on schedule. All oil\nshale companies were asked to postpone their\ndevelopment period for five to eight years.\nSome oil shale companies have completely\nstopped their projects in the aforementioned\nfields in the meantime.\nn\nn Oil and gas exploration: The British Petroleum\nCompany has completely stopped its\ndevelopment and exploration operations in\nthe Risha natural gas field in 2014 because\nthe reserves of natural gas discovered were\nnot deemed commercially viable.\nn\nn Expansion of Jordan Oil Refinery Project:\nThe Jordan Oil Refinery was unsuccessful\nin pushing ahead with the 2015 refinery\nexpansion project, designed to convert heavy\npetroleum derivatives to light products and\nto improve the specifications of petroleum\nproducts.\nn\nn Due\nto\nregional\npolitical\ninstability,\nconstruction of the Iraqi crude oil pipeline\nwas delayed. The pipeline was supposed to\ntransport Iraqi crude oil across Jordan to the\nexport terminal in Aqaba.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n72\nc. Infrastructure projects, policies, laws, and\nby-laws of the TNC - under implementation\n“as planned”\nn\nn Crude oil and oil products storage: All strategic\nstock projects of Jordan to increase the\nstorage capacities of crude oil and oil products\nwill be completed and put in operation by\nthe end of 2017.\nn\nn Natural gas projects: The construction of\nLNG jetty at Aqaba seaport, the connection\nto the Arab gas pipeline, and the leasing of a\nfloating storage and regasification unit (FSRU)\nwere successfully implemented and put in\ncommercial operation in September 2015.\nn\nn Renewable energy: Considerable progress has\nbeen achieved in utilizing renewable energy\nfor electricity generation. Currently, confirmed\nrenewable energy generation capacity has\nexceeded the renewable generating capacity\nof 960 MW by 2020 projected in the TNC\nbaseline scenario. As of end of 2015, 300\nMW of solar and wind projects have been\nconnected to the grid. By the end of 2017,\naround 550 MW of solar and wind is scheduled\nto be connected to the grid. Furthermore,\nsmall scale consumers have been given the\nopportunity in 2016 to generate their own\nelectricity and sell the excess (if any) to the\ndistribution utilities at a fixed tariff. Currently,\naround 70 MW of installed capacity as rooftop\nsystems have been installed.\nn\nn Energy Efficiency: Previously, all the activities\nin the energy efficiency field were considered\nin the mitigation scenario. A huge progress\nwas done by establishing the Jordan\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency\nFund (JREEEF).\nn\nn The laws and by-laws considered in the TNC\nbaseline scenario:\n-\tThe Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency\nlaw was approved as a permanent law in\n2012 and amended in 2014. The law allows\ninvestors to identify and develop gridconnected electricity production projects\nthrough the so called unsolicited or direct\nproposal submission.\n-\tThe bylaw of Direct Proposals of Renewable\nEnergy Projects has been issued in Mid-2015.\n-\tA well-founded reference price list (ceiling\nprices) for different renewable energy\ntechnologies was set by the Energy and\nMineral Regularity Commission (EMRC).\n-\tNet-metering for small renewable energy (RE)\nsystems (roof tops) with fixed purchase prices\nfor excess power has been set.\n-\tTax incentive: a bylaw was issued granting\ntax exemptions for RE and EE systems and\nequipment.\n-\tGrid expansion and reinforcement plans are\nongoing through the implementation of the\nGreen Corridor project.\n-\tThe JREEEF has been established.\nTable 3.2 summarizes the status of the energy\nbaseline scenario projects as stated in TNC.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n73\nTable 3.2: The status of the energy baseline scenario projects as stated in TNC.\nNo.\nProject\nStatus\nDate of\noperation\nCapacity\nRenewable Energy\nWind Energy\n1\nWind Project in Tafila\nIn operation\nSept. 2015\n117 MW\n2\nWind Project in Ma’an /Gulf Grant\nIn operation\nMarch 2016\n80 MW\nSolar PV\n3\nSolar PV Project in Mafraq\nIn operation\n2015\n10 MW\n4\nSolar PV Project in Azraq/Spanish Grant\nIn operation\nMarch 2016\n5 MW\n5\nSolar PV Projects/Direct Proposal\nSubmission- Stage I - 12 Projects - 9 of\nwhich in Ma’an\nUnder construction\n2016-2017\n200 MW\n6\nSolar PV Projects/Direct Proposal\nSubmission- Stage II - Northern & Eastern\nparts of Kingdom\nUnder construction\n2016-2017\n200 MW\n7\nSolar PV Project in Qweira /Gulf Grant\nUnder construction\n2017\n100 MW\nNatural Gas LNG\n8\nLNG terminal/Aqaba\nIn Operation\n2015\n9\nDevelopment of Risha Natural Gas Field\nCancelled\n50 MMcfd\nOil Shale\n10\nOil Shale Direct Burning 1 Estonian\nDelayed\n2020\n470 MW\n11\nOil Shale Direct Burning 2 Chinese\nConsortium\nCancelled\n600 MW\nOil and Oil Products\n13\nStorages of Crude Oil & Oil Products\nUnder construction\n2017\n430 Kt\nElectricity Generation\n14\nIPP3\nIn operation\n2015\n573 MW\n15\nIPP4\nIn operation\n2015\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n74\n3.4.1.2 The energy baseline scenario\nup to 2040\nAs mentioned earlier, changes in the economy\nand the energy sector since 2015 have affected\nthe sector’s strategies, policies, plans, activities,\nand projects. Therefore, the baseline scenario\nfor the period 2015-2040 has been reviewed and\nrebuilt, consistent with the new energy strategy\nof 2015-2025.\na. The new energy strategy of 2015-2025\nBased on the changes that have affected the\nenergy sector since 2015 driven by reduced\noil prices and the remarkable progress in the\nadoption of renewable energy projects, which\nwas facilitated by the declining cost of renewable\nenergy technologies, a new strategy for the\nenergy sector, consistent with “Jordan 2025”, was\nadopted and approved by the Ministerial Council\nin December 2015.\nThe new energy strategy seeks to:\nn\nn Achieve a secure sustainable supply of energy\nand optimal utilization of natural resources.\nn\nn Increase the contribution of local energy\nresources in the country’s energy mix.\nn\nn Reduce the burden of energy costs on the\nJordanian economy.\nn\nn Study the impacts of renewable energy\nprojects on the power generation system.\nAccording to the energy strategy 2015-2025 and its\ncomponents, the most probable baseline scenario\nin the energy sector will be based on the current\nsituation in the energy sector, the government’s\nefforts being made to achieve security of energy\nsupply, the adopted goals, policies, and laws in the\nenergy sector, and the planned and committed\nprojects within the energy strategy.\nb. Energy baseline scenario during the\nenergy strategy period 2015-2025\nThe policies, projects, and activities considered\nin the baseline scenario up to 2025 and beyond\nto the year 2040 are described below:\n1. The field of oil and oil products\nSecuring the Kingdom’s oil products needs will\nbe achieved by the following:\n-\tThe Jordan Petroleum Refinery will continue\nto produce 14 thousand tons per day (100\nthousand barrels), and the remaining\nneed of oil products will be imported. This\narrangement is supposed to last up to 2040.\n-\tThe Jordan Petroleum Refinery will proceed\nforward with implementing the expansion\nof the oil refinery to increase its capacity\nof converting heavy petroleum derivatives\nto light products and to improve the\nspecifications of petroleum products. The\nexpansion will be completed by 2022.\n-\tJordan will continue to meet its crude oil needs\nby importing Saudi Arabian oil via sea. The\ncrude will then be shipped by trucks to the\noil refinery. This arrangement is supposed to\nlast up to 2022.\n-\tConstruction of a pipeline will proceed forward\nto ship 1 million barrels per day of Iraqi crude\noil across Jordanian territory to the export\nterminal in Aqaba, in addition to a branch to\nsupply JPR with 150 thousand barrels per day\nof crude oil. The pipeline will be completed\nby 2022.\n-\tThe policy of petroleum products price\nliberalization will be sustained, as well as\npricing oil products on a monthly basis in\naccordance with changes in international\noil prices as a tool to improve the efficiency\nof consumption.\n-\tThe implementation of the oil sector\nrestructuring program and the establishment\nand operation of the logistics companies will\nbe completed.\n-\tProject work for the storage of strategic stocks\nof petroleum products sufficient for 60 days\nwill be implemented by:\nn\nn The construction of 100 thousand tons of\nstorage capacity for crude oil in Aqaba on\nengineering, procurement, and construction\n(EPC) basis.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n75\nn\nn The construction of strategic storage\ncapacities for light oil products with a\ncapacity of 250-300 thousand tons, and for\nLPG with a capacity of 8 thousand tons for\nLPG in the middle of Jordan on EPC basis to\nbe commercially operated in 2017.\nn\nn The establishment of the Oil Logistics\nCompany to secure the strategic storage\ncapacity of oil and oil products needed for\nthe country.\nIf the refinery expansion project does not get\nimplemented, the government will study the\nfollowing options:\n-\tOpen the way and announce the investment\nopportunity to build new oil refinery in Jordan.\n-\tDiscontinuing operations in the existing\nrefinery.\n-\tImporting oil products to meet Jordan’s needs.\nThis arrangement will achieve the following goals:\n-\tLinearization of oil products markets on\ncompetitive\nbasis.\n-\tImproving the specifications of the oil products\nin the local market.\n-\tImproving the quality of services delivered to\nthe consumers.\n2. The field of natural gas\nAs stated earlier, Jordan has the ability to meet\nthe country’s needs of natural gas for electricity\ngeneration and for industrial uses following\nconstruction of LNG terminal in Aqaba, which\nwas put in commercial operation in September\n2015. In 2016, 90% of electricity generation in the\nKingdom was based on natural gas delivered via\nthe Aqaba LNG terminal.\nThe demand for natural gas for electricity\ngeneration during the period 2016-2022 was\nestimated to be 350-420 MMcfd. During the period\n2023-2025, the estimated demand dropped to\n150-250 MMcfd due to substitution by oil shale\nand nuclear power which will come online during\nthe period in question. The demand for natural\ngas by the industrial sector was estimated to be\n150 MMcfd during the same period.\nIn addition to the LNG terminal in Aqaba, other\nregional options to supply Jordan with natural\ngas include Egypt and Gaza. Locally, the National\nPetroleum Company (NPC) plans to develop the\nRisha gas field to increase LNG production to 50\nMMcfd as a 1st stage. The company is working\non attracting strategic investors and partners,\nwhile seeking to create a favorable investment\nopportunity to develop Risha gas field.\n3. The field of renewable energy\nUnder construction and committed projects\nduring 2015-2021\nTremendous progress has been made in utilizing\nrenewable energy resources to generate electricity.\nTable 3.3 contains a list of electricity-generating\nrenewable energy projects with a capacity of 1150\nMW, some of which have become operational,\nsome are under construction, and some have been\ncommitted during the period 2015-2021.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n76\nTable 3.3: Wind and solar projects currently under development\nProject\nCapacity MW\nOperation\nWind Projects\nWind Project in Tafila\n117\nSept. 2015\nWind Project in Ma’an /Gulf Grant\n80\nFirst Quarter 2016\nWind Projects/Direct Proposal Submission -\nStage I\n330\nMid 2018\nAl Fujej Wind\n90\nMid 2019\nSolar Energy Projects\nSolar PV Project in Mafraq\n10\nSept. 2015\nSolar PV Project in Azraq/Spanish Grant\n5\nMarch 2015\nSolar PV Projects/Direct Proposal Submission -\nStage I - 12 Projects - 9 of which in Ma’an\n200\n2016\nSolar PV Projects/Direct Proposal Submission -\nStage II - Northern & Eastern parts of Kingdom\n200\n2016-2017\nSolar PV Project in Qweira /Gulf Grant\n103\n2017\nSmall Scale PV Systems, Roof tops\n100\nOn going\nThe total capacity of RE by the end of 2020 will\nbe around 1350 MW, representing 25% of all\ninstalled generating capacity and contributing\n20% of generated electricity. The electricity grid\nexpansion and reinforcement plan (green corridor\nproject) will be implemented by the end of 2019 at\na cost of 160 million JD. This will allow expansion\nin installed capacity in southern Jordan from 400\nMW to 1000 MW.\nIn addition to the mentioned renewable energy\nlarge-scale projects projects, other small-scale\nrenewable energy systems, the so-called net\nmetering (rooftops) systems, have been installed\non residential buildings, agricultural land, schools,\nmosques, and churches. In 2015 and 2016, around\n70 MW of net metering systems have been\ninstalled and this capacity is expected to double\nby the end of 2018.\nRenewable energy projects planned during\n2021-2025\nAdditional renewable energy projects (solar and\nwind) with a capacity of 900 MW are expected\nto be connected to the grid during the period\n2021-2025, and thus are considered part of the\nupdated baseline scenario.

The oil shale\ncompanies that asked for development period\nextension included Jordan Oil Shale Company\n(JOSCO), which intended to produce 20,000\nbarrels of oil in 2019, Jordan Oil Shale Energy\nCompany (JOSE), which intended to produce\n20,000 barrels/day in 2019, Karak International\nOil Company (KIO), which intended to produce\n25,000 barrels/day in 2024, and Saudi Arabian\nCorp for Oil Shale (SACOS), which intended to\nproduce 20,000 barrels/day in 2025.\n5. The Field of Nuclear Energy\nJordan’s interest in nuclear energy stems from the\nneed to address the challenges represented by the\nscarcity of domestic energy and water supplies.\nTo provide domestic long-lasting sources of\nenergy, the National Strategy of Energy of 2007\nhas strengthened the role of developing domestic\nand diversified sources of energy by introducing\nnuclear energy as an alternative to electricity\ngeneration. Hence, the Jordan Atomic Energy\nCommission (JAEC) was created in 2008 to achieve\ntwo major goals:\nn\nn To transfer, develop, and sustain the\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and radiation\ntechnology in the Kingdom; and\nn\nn To promote investment projects in radiation\ntechnology and nuclear energy such as\nelectricity generation and water desalination\nas well as other nuclear projects that boost\nthe national economy.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n80\nThe JAEC has selected the nuclear power plant\nsite in Amra.  JAEC announced that Rosatom’s\nreactor export subsidiary, Atom Story Export (ASE),\nwould supply two nuclear units on a build, own,\nand operate (BOO) basis with a capacity of 1000\nMW each. The first reactor will be commissioned\nin 2023 and the second in 2025 as stated in the\nnew energy strategy 2015-2025. The two nuclear\npower plants include third generation technology\nof Russian reactors which upholds the highest\nstandards of nuclear safety and security.\n3.4.1.3 Primary and final energy\ndemand\n- Primary energy demand\nBased on the baseline scenario analysis taking\ninto account all committed projects as well as the\neconomic variables, the LEAP output shows that\nthe primary energy required will be 10.3 Mtoe,\n11.53 Mtoe, and 16.33 Mtoe in 2020, 2025, and\n2040, respectively, with an annual growth rate of\n2.4% during the period 2015-2040 (full data are\npresented in Table A.1, Appendix A).\nTable 3.5 and Figure 3.1 show the total primary\nenergy requirements for selected years during the\nperiod 2015-2040.\nTable 3.5: Primary energy requirements (million tons of oil equivalent)\nBaseline scenario\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nEmissions\n9.24\n9.69\n9.93\n10.11\n10.3\n11.53\n13.68\n15.31\n16.33\nFigure 3.1: Primary energy requirements\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n81\n- Primary energy mix\nThe primary energy mix for some selected years within the study period is shown in Table 3.6 and Figure\n3.2. The primary energy mix in 2020 will consist of 50% oil products, 30% natural gas, 9% renewable\nenergy, and 6% oil shale, while in 2025 the primary energy mix will consist of 48% oil products, 7%\nnatural gas, 9% renewable energy, 22% nuclear, and 5% oil shale. The decline in natural gas contribution\nin the energy mix is attributed to the introduction of nuclear power into the mix in 2023 and 2025.\nTable 3.6: Primary energy mix (thousand toe), 2015-2040\nFuels\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nOil products\n6885\n5177\n5590\n6283\n5960\n6370\nNatural gas\n1752\n3113\n823\n1972\n2550\n2970\nRenewables\n170\n955\n1030\n1290\n1410\n1490\nNuclear\n-\n2945\n3010\n3010\n3010\nOil shale\n620\n645\n645\n1300\n1630\nCoal\n420\n448\n450\n420\n700\n750\nOthers\n13\n17\n47\n60\n80\n110\nTotal\n9240\n10330\n11530\n13680\n15010\n16330\nFigure 3.2: Primary energy mix (%), 2015-2040\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n82\nFinal energy demand by sector\nFinal energy demand (consumption) is the\ntotal energy consumed by end users, such\nas transportation, household, industry, and\nagriculture.\nIt is the energy which reaches final consumers’\ndoor and excludes energy used by the energy\nsector itself. In Jordan, it is mainly oil products\nand electricity.\nThe final energy demand by sectors for the baseline\nscenario up to 2040 is driven by GDP, population\nsize, population growth rate, and the value added\nby each sector over the period in question. The\nfinal demand is also driven by behavioral changes\nby the end users, modernization, and the price of\nthe final energy consumed. All of these variables\nhave been factored in the LEAP model. Table 3.7\nand Figure 3.3 show the final energy demand\nby sector for selected years during the period\n2015-2040 (full data are presented in table A.2,\nAppendix A).\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n83\nFinal energy demand in the transportation\nsector\nThe transportation sector accounted for 48%\nof the total final energy demand in 2015. The\ncurrent energy intensity of the transportation\nsector, measured at 0.07 Kgoe/Km per person\nand 0.05 Kgoe/ton per kilometer traveled, is\nconsidered too high as a result of a low specific\nload per vehicle (1.3 passenger/vehicle) and a lack\nof modern public transport system. This share of\nthe transportation sector is expected to decrease\nto 46% and 42% in 2020 and 2025, respectively,\ndue to the improvement measures that will be\nintroduced to the sector including the Bus Rapid\nTransit, service upgrade in public transport, and\nincreased penetration of hybrid and electric cars.\nFinal energy demand in other sectors\nThe industrial sector’s final energy consumption as\na percentage of the total final energy will increase\nfrom 17% in 2015 to 27% in 2040, consistent with\nthe sector’s targeted value added stated in “Jordan\n2025”. The services sector will experience a high\naverage growth rate of 5% annually, capturing\n10% of the total final energy consumption in 2040,\nup from 6% in 2015.\nAs for the share of the household final energy\nconsumption, it will decrease from 22% in 2015 to\n17% in 2040. The household sector will experience\na medium growth rate of 1.4% annually. This is\nprimarily attributed to the pricing mechanism\nused and to the shift towards more efficient\ndevices.\nTable 3.7: Final energy (thousand toe) demand by sector, 2015-2040\nBranches\nIndustrial\nResidential\nServices\nTransport\nOther\nTotal\n2015\n991\n1,272\n367\n2,810\n387\n5,828\n2020\n1,307\n1,443\n484\n3,133\n510\n6,876\n2025\n1,722\n1,592\n637\n3,401\n672\n8,024\n2030\n2,192\n1,706\n811\n3,639\n855\n9,203\n2035\n2,630\n1,778\n973\n3,784\n1,026\n10,191\n2040\n2,974\n1,800\n1,101\n3,822\n1,161\n10,857\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n84\nFigure 3.3: Final energy (thousand toe) demand by sector, 2015-2040\nFor more details, Tables A.3-A.6 in Appendix A\nshow the projected energy balances generated\nby LEAP for the selected years 2020, 2025,\n2030, and 2040.

It contributed directly and\nindirectly to about 40% of GDP through its linkages\nwith other key sectors such as transportation,\ninsurance, and trade.\nThe industrial sector consists of two subsectors,\nmanufacturing and mining. The manufacturing\n(converting) subsector includes chemicals,\nelectrical, engineering and construction, food\nand beverages, glass and ceramic, tobacco and\ncigarettes, paper and cartoon, pharmaceuticals\nand medical, printing and packaging, and textile\nand leathers. The mining subsector includes\nphosphate, potash, salt, carbonate, lime and\nlimestone, fertilizers, cement and construction.\nMineral extraction from mines and quarries is\nalso included.\nGovernmental strategies, policies, plans, and\nprojects to improve the industrial sector as well as\nplans by relevant companies have been reviewed\nto build the baseline scenario. The documents\nthat have been examined include the Ministerial\nStatement (governmental working plan 2013-\n2016), the national industrial policy (industrial\nsupport program 2010-2014), and Ministry of\nTrade, Industry, and Supply strategy (2014-2016).\nIn addition, “Jordan 2025” addresses the industrial\nsector with a focus on assisting in financing and\nincentivizing the development and sustainability\nof Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Also,\nin 2014, a High-Level Committee and a Unit for\nGreen Economy were established by a decree by\nthe Prime Minister, on the basis of which a National\nGreen Growth Plan for Jordan was developed by\nthe Ministry of Environment to be followed by\nan action plan for transitioning towards a green\neconomy.\nBased on this review, the following are a summary\nof the main plans/activities of the government\nto improve the industrial performance in Jordan:\n-\tSupport the development of the industrial\nsector and improve its competitiveness\nto effectively contribute to economic\ndevelopment of the country.\n-\tProtect intellectual and innovation rights in\nbusiness and establish the principles of the\nfree market’s rules.\n-\tSupport small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n-\tImprove the investment environment to attract\nforeign investments in all Governorates.\n-\tImprove infrastructure services needed for\nindustrial activities.\n-\tImprove education and vocational training to\nprepare qualified labor for industrial jobs.\n-\tEnhance communication between research\nand development centers and industries to\ncatalyze technology transfer and improve the\nutilization of knowledge.\n-\tEnhance the adaptation of Best Available\nTechnology (BAT) and Best Environmental\nPractices (BEP) in industrial processes.\n-\tImprove regulations and policies to encourage\nindustrial investment.\n-\tEnhance cooperation between the private and\npublic sectors.\n-\tEstablish a national strategy to improve\nthe penetration of local products into\ninternational export markets.\n-\tImprove the financial support mechanism to\nencourage industrial investments.\n-\tProvide technical support to industries\nto help them comply with technical and\nenvironmental standards.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n89\nGDP growth rates, as stated in” Jordan 2025”, and\npopulation growth rates during the period 20152040 have been used to update the projections of\nproduction, extraction, and import of industrial\nproducts that generate GHGs in Jordan up to\n2040. The list of industrial products includes\ncement production, lime production, nitric acid\nproduction, limestone, and soda ash.\nTable 3.10 shows the actual and estimated\nproduction, extraction, and import of selected\nproducts for selected years, while Table A.7 in\nAppendix A shows the full data set for the period\n2014-2040.\nTable 3.10: Actual and estimated production, extraction, and import of relevant industrial\nproducts for selected years\nYear\nClinker\nproduced\n(Ton)\nLime\nproduced\n(Ton)\nLimestone\nextracted\n(Ton)\nSoda ash\nimported\n(Ton)\nNitric acid\nproduced\n(Ton)\n2015\n3973131.8\n11315.6\n904065.0\n6566.7\n88866\n2020\n4845553.5\n13800.3\n1102579.9\n8008.6\n96000\n2025\n5909541.9\n16830.6\n1344684.8\n9767.2\n102000\n2030\n6817587.0\n19416.8\n1551305.7\n11268.0\n108000\n2035\n7865160.0\n22400.3\n1789675.3\n12999.4\n108000\n2040\n9073700.4\n25842.3\n2064672.3\n14996.8\n110000\n3.4.3 Baseline scenario for\nagriculture, forestry, and other land\nuse (AFOLU) sector\nNatural ecosystems in Jordan support human\nactivities in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,\ntourism, traditional and pharmaceutical health\nproducts, and traditional medicine, among others.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, less than\n5% of the country’s total area is arable land and\n90% is grazing land with 100-200 mm annual\nrainfall. Natural and human-made forests cover\naround 1% of the country’s area. The number of\nfarm holdings is 80,000, with an average area of 40\ndunum per holding (56,000 are plant production\nholdings and 14,000 are animal production\nholdings). Plant production holdings are mostly\nfield crops, olives, fruit trees, and vegetables.\nThe contribution of agriculture to the GDP in\nrelative terms declined sharply from 40% in\nthe 1950s to 4% in 2016. Irrespective of how\nhumble the contribution of agriculture is to GDP\nand economic performance, farming remains\nimportant. The importance of the agricultural\nsector stems from the fact that it is not only a\nmajor source of food, particularly dairy products,\nfruits and vegetables, but it is also a source of\nlivelihood for 25% of the total poor population\n(livestock keepers, smallholder farm households,\nand landless former agriculturalists) living in rural\nareas.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n90\nThe following were common objectives among\nall policies, strategies, plans, and programs\nannounced by the Ministry of Agriculture:\n-\tPromotion of sustainable and long-term use of\nresources in agricultural production.\n-\tConservation of biodiversity and promotion\nof sustainable use in agricultural production.\n-\tCombating desertification and strengthening\ntechnical capacities of people working in the\nagricultural sector to cope with probable\nclimate and environmental changes.\n-\tControl urban expansion on agricultural and\nforest land.\n-\tRestore degraded ecosystems of rangelands\nand forests through community based\nrangeland\nrehabilitation.\nThe baseline scenario for this sector was\nconstructed based on available governmental\nplans,\nprograms,\npolicies,\nand\nstrategies\nannounced and published by the Ministry of\nAgriculture, the Directorate of Forests, and other\nrelevant institutions. Consistent with these plans,\nthe following considerations have shaped the\nbaseline scenario:\nn\nn Field crops production: Increase productivity\nper unit area, promote water harvesting\ntechniques to expand planting areas, and\nmaintain productivity under predicted\ndecrease in rainfall.\nn\nn Animal production: Promote high productive\nanimal species under increase in prices of\nfodder, and other production inputs.\nn\nn Fodder production: Reclamation of rangelands\nand control overgrazing of rangelands,\nintroduce species with high productivity\nunder drought conditions and promote\nwastewater reuse in fodder production.\nn\nn Forestry conservation: Maintain forests which\nare threatened by predicted drought cycles,\nurban and rural expansion, expected fire\noccurrences, and illegal deforestation.\nTables A.8 to A.12 in Appendix A summarize actual\nand projected numbers of livestock, actual and\nprojected production of annual crops, actual and\nprojected areas for forest plantation, and number\nof perennial crops during the period 2015-2040.\nThe assumptions that directed the projections in\nthe agricultural activities up to 2040 are as follows:\nn\nn An assumed annual increase in livestock\nnumbers by 3% at the national level (taking\ninto consideration the positive annual\npopulation growth and the need to secure\nfood supply under scarce resources and\nproduction limitations that is projected\nto increase with climate change adverse\nimpacts).\nn\nn An assumed increase in the annual production\nof different crops by 3% at the national level\nand an associated 7% increase in the amount\nof added fertilizer.\nn\nn Changes in forest land\n-\tAn assumed increase in forest plantation areas\nby 1%.\n-\tAn assumed increase in the private forest\nholdings by 1%.\n-\tProtected natural forests with maintained\nconstant areas.\n3.4.4 Baseline scenario for waste\nsector\nThe waste sector in Jordan handles three categories\nof waste: municipal solid waste, domestic\nwastewater, and industrial wastewater. Municipal\nsolid waste is transported directly to landfill sites\nor to transfer stations, where it is compacted\nand retransferred to landfills using larger trucks\nto improve operational efficiency and reduce\ncost. Dumpsites are managed by Joint Services\nCouncils except for the Al-Ghabawi landfill, which\nis operated and managed by the Greater Amman\nMunicipality. Fifty percent of municipal waste is\ndumped in Al-Ghabawi landfill, the only sanitary\nlandfill in Jordan, while most of the remaining waste\nis dumped into well controlled dumpsites. Open\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n91\ndumping of solid waste accounts for not more than\n5% of all solid waste generated. According to the\nSweep Net Report of 2010 and 2014, the rate of\nsolid waste generation in Jordan is 0.9 kg/day per\ncapita, with a 90% collection coverage in urban\nareas compared with 70% in rural areas. Only 10%\nof collected waste is recycled, while the remaining\n90% is dumped in landfills. Although there are 18\nworking landfills in Jordan, Al-Ghabawi and AlEkader landills are by far the largest, receiving more\nthat 60% of all waste sent to landfills. A sanitary cell\nis planned to be constructed in Al-Ekader landfill\nin 2017. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs plans to\ndecrease the number of landfill sites and shift the\nload to transfer stations that will in turn convey\ncompacted waste to central landfills.\nDifferent laws and regulations govern solid waste\nmanagement and handling. Municipalities’ law\nNo. 13/2011 assigns the responsibility of waste\ncollection to municipalities, while the general\nframework law of waste management, under\ndevelopment by the Ministry of Environment,\nseeks to provide general guidance for waste\nmanagement. Public health law No. 47/2008 seeks\nto prevent nuisances resulting from illegal and\ninappropriate dumping.\nLiquid waste in Jordan is divided into domestic\nand industrial wastewater. Domestic wastewater\nis collected by sewerage networks and tankers\nand transported to wastewater treatment plants,\nwhich are mostly operated by the Water Authority\nof Jordan with a few plants operated by the private\nsector through agreements with the Ministry of\nWater and Irrigation. Reclaimed wastewater is\nconsidered as a water source, according to the\nJordan water strategy. Treated wastewater is\nused primarily to supplement clean water for\nirrigation purposes. According to the Ministry of\nWater and Irrigation, 14377 dunum of agricultural\nland was irrigated with treated wastewater in\n2014. The practice of using treated wastewater\nfor industrial purposes is limited to the city of\nAqaba. In 2007, treated domestic wastewater\nwas 87 MCM accounting for 10.3% of the water\nbudget, while treated industrial wastewater was\n4 MCM accounting for 1.3%. In 2022, treated\ndomestic wastewater is predicted to reach 220\nMCM accounting for 13.3% of the water budget,\nwhile treated industrial treated wastewater is\nexpected to reach 27 MCM accounting for 2.3%\nof the water budget.\nAs of 2016, there were 33 working wastewater\ntreatment plants (WWTP) in Jordan. Samra is the\nlargest wastewater treatment plant treating more\nthan 70% of all generated wastewater. Anaerobic\ndigestion is used at Samra to treat biosolids,\ngenerating methane gas which is then combusted\nfor electricity production. Other wastewater\ntreatment plants plan to utilize biosolids for\nelectricity production.\nDifferent laws, regulations, and instructions\ngovern the wastewater treatment sector in Jordan.\nSewerage system regulation No. 66/1994 regulates\nconnections to the sewer network. Treated\nwastewater must comply with JS 893/2006.\nMinistry of Agriculture according to agriculture law\nhas set the instructions no 4/2004 to use treated\nwastewater for irrigation.\nMost of the industries in Jordan are small and\nmedium enterprises (SMEs). They are located\nwithin Industrial Estates, Qualified Industrial Zones\nor located separately. The Amman-Zarqa region\nis the largest urban center, where the majority of\nJordanian industry is concentrated. According to\nMWI figures, the ratio of industrial to total water\nuse in 2013 was very small (4.3%). Industrial\nwastewater is usually pre-treated at on-site units\nbefore being discharged to the central wastewater\ntreatment plant within the industrial estate for\nfurther treatment or to locations to be used for\ntrees irrigation or to nearby Wadis. Many industrial\nentities (e.g., food industries) generate wastewater\nthat complies with the connection requirements\nto the sewerage network, and therefore, divert\ntheir wastewater to the public sewer system. It\nis assumed that aerobic treatment is used at the\nindustrial estates’ wastewater treatment plants,\nwhich results in negligible GHG emissions.\nThe waste sector has been reviewed and the\nbaseline scenario updated taking into account\nthe following:\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n92\nn\nn In line with Jordan water strategy, all possible\ncubic meter of wastewater is to be treated to\nreplace fresh water in agricultural purposes.\nn\nn Current wastewater treatment plants will\nregularly be modified to account for increased\ngeneration of domestic wastewater driven by\npopulation growth. However, expansion will\nprimarily take place at plants that serve urban\nareas.\nn\nn Current water consumption and generated\nwastewater per capita is assumed to be fixed.\nn\nn All future needed WWTPs will be mechanical\nwith activated sludge method of operation.\nn\nn Biogas utilization from the digestion of\nsludge is mainly practiced at the Samra plant.\nHowever, other plants, such as Shalalah, have\nstarted to utilize biogas and other plants are\nplanning to do so in the future.\nn\nn Most of the sludge produced from other\ntreatment plants will be dried and disposed\nof in landfill sites.\nn\nn Solid waste production rate per capita is\nassumed to be fixed at 0.9 kg/capita/day.\nn\nn Protein consumption per capita is fixed at 29.6\nkg/capita/year.\nn\nn Factories and industrial plants are located\nwithin industrial cities or outside of them.\nAll plants located within the industrial cities\nare connected to central well managed\naerobic wastewater treatment plants. Plants\nlocated outside the industrial cities are mostly\nconnected to domestic wastewater plants in\naccordance with Water Authority regulations.\nTables A.13-A.16 in Appendix A show actual and\nprojected generated amounts of domestic solid\nwaste (2010-2040), quantities of wastewater\ndischarged to WWTPs (2010-2015), and influent\norganic load to WWTPs in 2015.\n3.5 GHG Emissions in Baseline\nScenario for Different Sectors\n3.5.1 GHG emissions from the energy\nsector\nThis section presents the energy sector’s GHG\nemissions profile in the baseline scenario as\ngenerated by the LEAP model. GHG emissions\nby the energy sector in the baseline scenario\nare shown in Table A.17 in Appendix A. The data\nindicates that the energy sector is the primary\nsource of GHG emissions in Jordan accounting\nfor 81% and 84% of all emissions in 2010 and\n2012, respectively, according to the 2010 and\n2012 GHG Inventory. The role of the energy sector\nand subsectors as the leading emitter of GHGs is\nexpected to continue in the future. However, it\nis expected that the sector’s share will decline to\n69% of all emissions in 2040 due to the assumed\nintroduction of nuclear power as well as the\ninclusion of more renewable energy sources in\nthe total energy mix. Therefore, the energy sector\nwill be the focus of mitigation efforts.\nThe most significant GHG sources in energy\ndemand and supply sector are in order; electricity\ngeneration, transportation, industrial, residential\nand commercial. As shown in Figure (3.7) in 2015,\nenergy sector GHG emissions reached 25.71\nmillion metric Tons (Mt) CO2eq.\nEmissions will increase at an average rate of 1.1%\nannually between 2015 and 2040 and reach a total\nof 31.42 M tons of CO2eq in 2040, compared with\n25.71 M tons of CO2eq in 2015.\nTable 3.11 shows the total GHG emissions from\nthe energy demand and supply sector in the\nbaseline scenario in selected years. Figure 3.8\nshows a graphical representation of those same\nemissions during the period 2012-2040.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n93\nFigure 3.7: Share (%) of GHG emissions by energy subsector, 2015\nTable 3.11: Total GHG emissions (Million tons of CO2eq) from energy demand and supply in the\nbaseline scenario for selected years\nBaseline scenario\n2013\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nEmissions\n24.23\n25.71\n26.90\n22.61\n27.96\n29.05\n31.42\nFigure 3.8: Total GHG emissions (Million Tons of CO2eq) from energy demand and supply in the\nbaseline scenario, 2013-2040\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n94\nThe GHG emissions from various energy demand\nand supply subsectors are described below:\n-\tThe most significant change in sectoral\ncontribution is in the power sector where\nemissions will decline at an average annual\nrate of 1.6% attributed to the introduction\nof a 2000 MW nuclear power plant, and\nthe increasing share of renewable sources\nin electricity generation, and the shift to\nincreased use of natural gas, which is less\ncarbon intensive than oil products, fuel oil,\nand diesel, even when taking into account\nthe increased use of oil shale.\n-\tThe transportation sector’s GHG emissions\nwill grow at an average annual rate of 1.2%\nduring the period 2015-2040. The emissions\nwill increase to 11.69 M Tons of CO2eq in 2040,\ncompared to 8.62 M Tons of CO2eq and 10.7 M\nTons of CO2eq in 2015 and 2020, respectively.\nThis is mostly attributed to an increase in fleet\nsize and to growth in transportation services.\n-\tIndustrial GHG emissions will grow at a high\naverage rate of 4.5% annually in the period\n2015-2040, reaching to 7.03 M Tons of\nCO2eq in 2040 compared with 2.34 M Tons\nof CO2eq in 2015. The growth in emissions\nis due to a more developed sector and to\ngovernment policies designed to increase\nthe contribution of value-adding industrial\ngrowth opportunities to GDP.\n-\tThe share of GHG emissions from the residential\nsector will increase slightly from 5% (1.52 M\nTons of CO2eq) in 2015 to 6% (1.73 M Tons of\nCO2eq) in 2020 and to 6.2% (2.16 M Tons of\nCO2eq) in 2040.\nTable 3.12 and Figure 3.9 show the sectoral GHG\nemissions from energy demand and supply in\nthe baseline scenario for selected years. Table\n3.13 shows the emissions by greenhouse gas in\nthe energy baseline scenario for selected years.\nCarbon dioxide dominates other GHGs in the\nenergy sector, a trend expected to continue over\nmany years.\nTable 3.12: GHG emissions (Million tons of CO2eq) from energy demand and supply subsectors\nin the baseline scenario in selected years\nBranches\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\nDemand\n13.30\n15.48\n17.79\n20.15\n22.07\n23.31\nIndustrial\n2.34\n3.09\n4.07\n5.18\n6.22\n7.03\nResidential\n1.52\n1.73\n1.91\n2.04\n2.13\n2.16\nServices\n0.35\n0.46\n0.61\n0.77\n0.93\n1.05\nTransport\n8.62\n9.60\n10.41\n11.13\n11.58\n11.69\nOthers\n0.46\n0.61\n0.80\n1.02\n1.22\n1.38\nTransformation\n12.41\n11.42\n4.82\n7.81\n6.97\n8.11\nElectricity generation\n12.41\n11.42\n4.82\n7.80\n6.97\n8.11\nTotal\n25.71\n26.90\n22.61\n27.96\n29.04\n31.42\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n95\nFigure 3.9: GHG emissions (Million tons of CO2eq) by energy subsector in the baseline scenario\nfor selected years\n3.5.2 GHG emissions from the IPPU sector\nThe IPPU sector contributed 9% and 12% in 2010 and 2012, respectively, to the overall GHG emissions\nin Jordan, ranking in second place after the energy sector. It is expected to contribute 5890 Gg of CO2eq\nin 2040, accounting for 13% of all GHG emissions. The cement industry is the main contributor to the\nIPPU sector’s GHG emissions. Other contributors include the production and use of lime, limestone,\nsoda ash, and nitric acid.

It\nis projected to contribute 3180 Gg of CO2eq in\n2040, accounting for 7% of all GHG emissions.\nThe main contributor to AFOLU emissions is the\nlivestock subsector. Baseline emissions from the\nAFOLU sector for the period 2015-2040 are listed\nin Table A.19 of Appendix A. Table 3.15 shows the\ntotal GHG emissions from the AFOLU sector in\nthe baseline scenario by gas in selected years. For\nthe AFOLU sector, the baseline scenario (the net\nemissions sources and sinks) was estimated using\nthe same categories in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines.\nTable 3.15: GHG emissions (Gg of CO2eq) by gas in the AFOLU baseline scenario for selected\nyears\nYear\nCH4 emissions\nfrom livestock\nN2O emissions from\nmanaged soils\nNet CO2 emissions\nfrom land\nTotal CO2eq\nGg of CO2eq\n2015\n27.89\n0.020\n-197.73\n394.10\n2020\n39.12\n0.028\n-137.58\n692.52\n2025\n54.87\n0.039\n-95.7\n1068.52\n2030\n76.96\n0.054\n-66.58\n1566.30\n2035\n107.94\n0.076\n-46.32\n2243.88\n2040\n151.39\n0.106\n-32.22\n3179.9\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n97\n3.5.4 GHG emissions from the waste\nsector\nThe waste sector is the third largest contributor\nto GHG emissions in Jordan according to the 2010\nand 2012 GHG Inventory, accounting for 7% and\n6% of all GHG emissions, respectively. Solid waste\ncontributes the most emissions. The waste sector\ncontribution is expected to increase to 5070 Gg\nof CO2eq in 2040, accounting for a share of 11%\nof the total GHG emissions.\nAs AsSamra WWTP (the largest in Jordan)\nconverted its operation from natural treatment\nmethod (partly anaerobic) to aerobic mode,\nthe emissions of methane were considered to\nbe negligible. Baseline emissions for the waste\nsector for the period 2015-2040 are listed in Table\nA.20 of Appendix A. Table 3.16 below provides a\nsummary for selected years.\n3.5.5 Overall GHG emissions in the\nbaseline scenario\nJordan’s anthropogenic emissions by sources, and\nremovals by sinks, of all GHGs in 2010 and 2012\nwere 23140 Gg of CO2eq and 27998 Gg of CO2eq,\nrespectively. These emissions are expected to grow\naccording to the baseline scenario to 34330 Gg\nof CO2eq, 31450 Gg of CO2eq, 38180 Gg of CO2eq,\nand 45560 Gg of CO2eq in 2020, 2025, 2030, and\n2040, respectively.\nTable 3.17 shows the total GHG emissions in the\nbaseline scenario for selected years in Jordan.\nFigure 3.10 and Table A.21 of Appendix A illustrate\nthe overall GHG emissions in the baseline scenario\nand those of the emitting sectors of energy,\nindustrial processes, waste, and AFOLU.

The cost-benefit analysis and the\nCO2 emissions reduction have been updated for\neach proposed mitigation project. Additional GHG\nmitigation measures have also been identified,\nanalyzed, and added to the list of the updated\nmitigation measures. Net present value was used\nin the financial calculations, by converting all\npresent and future revenues and costs over the\nlifetime of the project to a base of today’s cost.\nThe same approach was followed in calculating\nCO2 emissions reduction over the lifetime of the\nproposed projects. A discount rate of 8% was\nused in all calculations. The discounted unit\ncost of reduced emissions is the quotient of\nthe discounted net cash flow to the discounted\nemissions reduction.\nThe LEAP software model was used to perform\nthe energy mitigation analysis, while analysis of\nnon-energy sectors was conducted separately\nand then merged with the energy analysis in\nthe LEAP model to generate the overall national\nscenario. The impact of the mitigation options was\nassessed versus the baseline scenario. The updated\nmitigation scenario includes 39 GHG mitigation\nprojects in the following areas:\nn\nn Primary energy;\nn\nn Renewable energy;\nn\nn Energy efficiency;\nn\nn Industrial processes;\nn\nn Waste; and\nn\nn Agriculture and forestry.\nThe results of the mitigation analysis are presented\nin the following sub-sections.\n3.6.1 Mitigation options for primary\nenergy\n3.6.1.1 Updates on the TNC projects\nThe GHG mitigation options in the primary energy\ndemand and supply that were considered in the\nTNC report have been reviewed and assessed. All\ninformation is presented in a tabular format in\nAppendix A, Table A.22. Table 3.18 is a summary\nof the TNC mitigation projects and their status.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n101\nTable 3.18: Status of the TNC primary energy mitigation projects\nProject Name\nStatus\nLoss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution Network\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario\nImproving Combustion in Rehab Power Plant\nCancelled -no longer valid\nCombined Cycle Gas Turbine in Risha Plant\nCancelled due to reduction of natural gas\nproduction and delay in implementation of\nRisha field development\nDistribution Network of Natural Gas in Aqaba\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario to include Zarqa and\nAmman in addition to Aqaba\nDemand Side Management\nStill valid and considered in the current\nmitigation scenario\nNuclear Power Plant (1000 MW)\nMoved from the TNC mitigation scenario\nand considered within current BUR baseline\nscenario according to the updated energy\nstrategy 2015-2025\n3.6.1.2 Mitigation scenario for primary\nenergy up to 2040\nNewly identified projects for the primary energy\nsubsector as well as those that have been updated\nfrom the TNC are briefly described below.\nn\nn Loss Reduction in Electricity Transmission and\nDistribution (T&D) Network (TNC updated\nproject)\nThis project seeks to reduce the T&D losses to 12%\nin 2020 compared to 16.5% in 2015. The duration\nof the project is 6 years and will be implemented\ngradually. The main components of the project will\nbe optimizing the utilization of distribution and\ngeneration, improving the system power factor,\nand upgrading or replacing existing conductors\nand insulators with lower-resistance equipment.\nThe cost is estimated to be USD 275 per KW. This\nproject can lead to a significant reduction in fuel\nconsumption and eliminate 8435 thousand tons\nof CO2eq discounted emissions over the next 23\nyears.\nn\nn Natural Gas Distribution Network in Amman,\nZarqa, and Aqaba (TNC updated and modified\nproject)\nThe natural gas needed for the electricity\ngeneration during the period 2016-2022 is\nestimated to be 350-420 MMcfd, while in the\nperiod 2023-2025 the quantity will be decreased\nto 150-250 MMcfd due to the oil shale and nuclear\npower plant projects. The demand of the industrial\nsector for natural gas is estimated to be 150\nMMcfd while the demand of the residential and\ntransportation will be around 90 MMcfd in the\nsame period.\nAccording to the energy strategy 2015-2025,\nJordan will enhance the usage of Natural Gas\nin all sectors such as the Industrial, Residential,\nCommercial and Transportation.\nIn 2016, 90% of the electricity generation of the\nKingdom based on natural gas imported via\nterminals.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n102\nTo deliver natural gas to smaller customers it\nwill be necessary to construct new low-pressure\ngas distribution in Amman, Zarqa and Aqaba\nnetworks and to connect customers to the\nnew infrastructure. Investments required in this\nindustry are large. The duration of this project\nwill be for 10 years, starting in 2020 and will be\nexecuted gradually with a capital cost of USD 110\nmillion.\nNatural gas combustion emits 1.2 times less CO2\nthan that of oil, which indicates that using natural\ngas in demand side sector as an alternative for\ndiesel, fuel oil, LPG and gasoline will reduce a\nsignificant quantity of CO2 emissions. Using the\nnatural gas in distributing network in Amman,\nZarqa and Aqaba will reduce about 3442 thousand\ntons of CO2eq discounted emissions in the next\n20 years.\nn\nn Demand Side Management -DSM (TNC\nupdated\nproject)\nDSM includes any actions implemented to reduce\nthe contribution to system peak load or reduce\noverall energy consumption. The basic objective\nof DSM is to reduce costs (operating and capital\ncosts) through improving efficiency of end\nuses of electricity or modifying their electricity\nconsumption pattern which save the equivalent\nof adding annually 100 MW to the system. The\nduration of the project is about five years starting\nin 2018. This project will be very efficient and can\nlead to significant reduction in CO2 emissions\nwhich account to 2842 thousand tons CO2 discount\nemissions through the next 22 years.\nn\nn Adding a 100 MW Combined cycle in Samra\nPower Plant (newly identified project)\nIt is suggested to convert two gas turbines into\ncombined cycle power plant by adding 100 MW\nsteam turbine, in this configuration, a natural\ngas is burned to operate the two-gas turbine\nto generate electricity. The hot turbine exhaust\ngasses are passed through a steam boiler to\nproduce steam to feed steam turbine. The steam\nturbine utilizes waste heat from the turbine that,\nin a simple cycle would have been rejected to\nthe atmosphere. This project will add 100 MW\nto the plant capacity without any extra cost for\nadditional fuel. The additional electricity increases\nthe overall system efficiency.

All these\nfluorescent tubes have conventional ballasts.\nReplacing these units with (18X4) LED fixtures\nwill result in 60 Watts saving in each fixture.\nThe Government of Jordan represented by the\nMEMR and particularly JREEEF will initiate this\nprocess and distribute 100 000 LED lamps.\nn\nn Insulating Walls and Roofs In 35 Thousand\nHouses (TNC updated Project)\nThis proposed project will be implemented\ngradually starting from 2018 up to 2040,\nwith 8.53 kton CO2eq as average rate of GHGs\nreduction annually.\nn\nn Street Lighting: Replacing 125 W Mercury\nlamps with 70 W high Pressure Sodium lamps\n(TNC updated Project)\nIn street lighting, it is suggested to replace\n200,000 lamps that are now of Mercury type\nwith lamps of High Pressure Sodium (HPS).\nn\nn Using Regenerative Burners Instead Of\nConventional Burners in Steel Reheating\nIndustry (TNC updated Project)\nThis proposed project will be implemented\ngradually starting from 2018 up to 2040, with\n7.47 kton CO2 eq as average rate of GHGs\nreduction annually.\nn\nn Using variable speed drives in the pumps (TNC\nupdated project)\nThis proposed project will be implemented\ngradually starting from 2019 up to 2040, with\n8.53 kton CO2 eq as average rate of GHGs\nreduction annually.\nn\nn LED Lighting in Public Buildings (Newly\nidentified project)\nThis measure intends to distribute 10-watt\nTube- 35000 LED Lamps in public buildings.\nThe LED lamps will replace the existing 4x18\nwatt fluorescent lamps. By distributing these\nlamps, it is estimated that energy savings will\nbe more than 40% of the fluorescent lighting\nconsumption. Every 18-watt fluorescent lamp\nwill be replaced by 10-watt LED lamp.\nn\nn Improving Energy Efficiency in Small and\nMedium Hotels (newly identified project)\nThe program that will be initiated by JREEEF\naims at improving energy efficiency in small\nand medium existing hotels in Jordan. The\nowners of these hotels have limited internal\nfunds to invest in EE projects and poor access\nto commercial financing and lack of knowledge\nand awareness of the available technologies.\nThe program will consist of financial and\ntechnical support, combined with awareness\nand communication campaigns to undertake\nappropriate energy efficient measures in this\ncategory of hotels. All energy efficiency measure\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n107\ncan be eligible, including envelope insulation,\nimprovement of air conditioning and heating\nequipment, efficient lighting, etc. The program\ncan target 100 to 120 small and medium hotels\nthroughout Jordan. The program will lead to an\nannual energy savings of 10,000,000 KWh with\na reduction in emissions of around 5.8 kt CO2\nn\nn LED Lighting in Households (newly identified\nproject)\nThis measurer intends to distribute 150 000 E27LED Lamps for residential sector (specifically\nfor low consumption households class (< 600\nKWh/month).

Table 3.24 is a summary of their status. All TNC projects are now considered\nas part of the baseline scenario. No new projects have been suggested in this FBUR because of the\nlack of expertise in this sector at the national level as well as the lack of clarity in responsibilities and\nmandates among different acting institutions within the sector.\nTable 3.24 Status of mitigation projects in the transportation sector\nProject Name\nStatus\nReduction by using hybrid cars for\npublic passengers\nMoved from the TNC mitigation scenario and\nconsidered as part of the current BUR baseline scenario\nReduction by Amman – Zarqa Bus\nRapid Transit (BRT)\nMoved from the TNC mitigation scenario and\nconsidered as part of the current BUR baseline scenario\n3.6.5 Mitigation options in the IPPU sector\n3.6.5.1 Updates on the TNC projects\nGHG mitigation options in the IPPU sector that were considered in the TNC report have been reviewed\nand assessed.

Jordan has more than 5 steel melting and\ngalvanizing factories, therefore; there is available\nstock of steel slag and fly ash to be used in cement\nindustry.\nIn this mitigation project, it is suggested to\nproduce new type of cement CEM V (Composite\nCement) at one of the cement industries; mainly\nthe one that has a neighbor steel manufacturing\ncompany and can try the production of such\ntype of cement with minor additional costs in\ncomparison to other existing companies. The\npercentages of blast-furnace slag and natural\npozzolana ranges between 31-49% per each to\nproduce CEM V/B. Accordingly, a 40% substitution\nof steel slag/fly ash and a 10% production of new\nCEM V/B will be assumed at this company.\nThe price of steel slag and/or fly ash is estimated\nto be 23.1 JD/ton available cost of 25-40 USD/\nton). The cost of energy and raw materials reach\n61% of total cost and based on the assumption of\nproduction cost of 49 JD/ton cement, this option\nwill reduce the cost by 29.9 JD/ton cement. No\nannual increase in the production costs will be\nassumed for the period (2018 – 2040). Investment\ncost to grind the steel slag will be estimated as\n911,564 JD (based on the maximum produced\ntons of CEM II in 2040) based on the estimated\ncost of 0.75 USD/ton cement.\nn\nn Increase the percentage of Pozzolana in CEM\nII (TNC updated project)\nBlended cement is a mixture of clinker and\nadditives containing less than 95% clinker. Blended\ncement types are distinct products with different\nuses that have different additives and different\nshares of clinker. More than 90% of cement\nproduced at the local cement companies is CEM\nII (Portland–Pozzolana Cement) with a percentage\nof Pozzolana ranges between 21-32%. Therefore;\nthere is an area to increase the percentage of\nPozzolana in CEM II by improving the reactivity of\nthe produced clinker and the raw mix to produce\nCEM II/B-P to achieve the required strength of\n42.5N that cause the use of Pozzolana of less than\n32% (the 3% is substituted by gypsum). Based\non the provided data from one of the Cement\nCompanies, the average percentage of Pozzolana\nin CEM II is around 32% (65% clinker as per the\nfollowing information and calculations and 3%\nGypsum), so this option is not required to be\nimplemented for this company. A reasonable 2%\nmore substitution could be assumed on average\nand so a reduction of CO2 emissions by 2% could\nbe assumed as well.\nSince all local cement companies produce CEM\nII, there is no need for investment to construct\nthe equipment needed to receive, store, grind\nand meter Pozzolana to the cement product. The\noperational cost includes the price of extraction\nto Natural Resources Authority (NRA) and\ntransportation. However; this option will reduce\nthe cost of raw materials (mainly limestone) and\nenergy needed to produce the saved clinker that\nwill be substituted by Pozzolana. To have time\nfor the experimental trials, it is expected to start\nthe implementation of such project in 2018. The\nproject lifetime will be as the lifetime of Cement\nPlants which expected to be more than 50 years.\nThe price of pozzolana is estimated to be 20 JD/\nton. And as mentioned above, this option will\nreduce the cost by 29.9 JD/ton cement to save\nboth energy and raw materials and no extra\ninvestment cost is needed.\nn\nn Produce new cement product CEM IV with\n45% of Pozzolana (TNC updated project)\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\n110\nIt is estimated that 10% of currently produced\nCEM II/B-P will be changed to CEM IV, strength\n22.5X in which the Pozzolana substitution will\nreach 45% (more by at least 13% (=45-32)). CO2\nreduction will be calculated by multiplying the\nannual CO2 emissions by the reduced percentage\nof 13% regarding that for our case this percentage\nwill be also multiplied by the percentage of the\nproducts that will be converted from CEM II/B-P\nto CEM IV which is assumed to be 10% of CEM\nII/B-P. Therefore; annual CO2 emissions from\nproducing CEM II/B-P will be multiplied by 1.3%\nto calculate the CO2 emissions reduction because\nof implementing this option.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, marketing\nthe new product, set the legally binding\nregulations and enforcement measures to control\nits use, it is expected to start the implementation\nof such project in 2018. The project lifetime will be\nas the lifetime of Cement Plants which expected\nto be more than 50 years. The price of pozzolana\nis estimated to be 20 JD/ton. And as mentioned\nabove, this option will reduce the cost by 29.9 JD/\nton cement to save both energy and raw materials\nand no extra investment cost is needed.\nn\nn Use of biomass (MSW or/and Sewage Sludge)\nas alternative fuels (TNC updated project)\nA potential reduction of CO2 emissions in cement\nindustry could be achieved by switching from a\ntraditional fossil fuel to a biomass fuel which is\nbased on the specific emission factor for the fuel\nas related to its calorific value and carbon content.\nMost organic materials have a calorific value of 9-16\nGJ/ton cement, while the main firing of a cement\nkiln requires at least 18-20 GJ/ton cement. Therefore;\nbiomass shall be blended with other fuels.\nSince most of local cement factories are licensed\nto burn coal, petcoke and alternative fuels such\nas waste tires, oil shale and used oil to replace\nthe expensive heavy fuel oil, they are equipped\nwith multi-purpose burners which reduce the\ninvestment costs for using biomass as alternative\nfuels. However, the required capital cost depends\non the needed storage, segregation, handling,\ngrinding and metering as well as environmental\npollution control measures.\nTo have time for the experimental trials, studies\nof the maximum percentage of MSW and dried\nsewage sludge to be used, availability of stocks\nat market, testing the emissions, conduct EIA\nstudy and get the environmental clearance; it\nis expected to start the implementation of such\nproject in 2018. The project lifetime will be as the\nlifetime of Cement Plants which expected to be\nmore than 50 years.\nn\nn Catalytic reduction of n2o inside the ammonia\nburner of the nitric acid plant (TNC updated\nproject)\nThe project activity involves the installation\nof a new N2O abatement technology that is\nnot commonly used in nitric acid plants. The\nabatement technology is a pelleted catalyst\nthat will be installed inside the ammonia burner\njust underneath the precious metal gauzes. This\ntechnology is capable to reduce approximately\n75% to 80% of the N2O formed at the precious\nmetal gauzes inside the ammonia burner to\natmospheric N2 and O2.\nThe precious metal gauzes suffer a continuous\nloss of metal therefore; they are replaced during\nspecific period known as campaign. The average\nproduction per campaign is 30,000 tons of\n100% nitric acid). The selected N2O abatement\ntechnology depends on replacing some of Al2O3\nballs that support the platinum-rhodium catalyst\nby base metal secondary catalyst, which is capable\nof reducing N2O by at least 75%.\nThere are no economic benefits, enforcement\nregulations or pollution abatement benefits of\nimplementing such project, it only aims at reducing\nthe GHG emissions, therefore; its implementation\nstrongly depends on having economic incentives.\nThe project is assumed to start in 2018 and its\nlifetime is estimated to be same as the lifetime\nof KEMAPCO plant which is estimated to be 25\nyears (till the year 2040).\nThe costs and the CO2 emissions reduction for\nthe proposed IPPU mitigation projects have been\nanalyzed.

A review of those articles on\naverage they were as follows:\nGreater Amman municipality estimated a loss of\n2100 pine and coniferous trees from public parks.\nJordan University estimated a loss of 1000 trees.\nRoyal Scientific Society estimated a loss of 400\ntrees.\nTotal number of trees suggested by the project=\n3500 medium size coniferous trees.\nA medium growth coniferous tree, planted in an\nurban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years,\nsequesters 0.039-ton CO2 per planted tree.\nn\nn Forestry- Introduce new plantations in\nNorthern\nArea\nNo formal estimations were published for\nthe losses in trees, but numbers in the local\nnewspapers on average declared losses from\nAjloun and Jerash were 26 000 trees.\n26 000 trees will be planted over five years\n10 000 Jerash è 2000 tree per year\n16 000 Ajloun è 4000 first year and then 3000\ntrees per year\nn\nn Rangelands Project 1: Restoration of\nRangeland\nAreas\nJordan natural rangelands play an important role\nin covering the livestock feed requirements. In\nspite of the damage, they sustained during the\npast five decades the livestock feed. They cover\nfeed requirements for a period of 2- 3 months\nwithout complimentary feeding or 30% of food\nrequirements. The productivity of rangelands is\nhighly dependent on rainfall, topography and soil.\nFeed unit productivity of rangelands is estimated\nat 40 kilograms of dry feed matter per dunum in\nareas with 100-200 mm of annual rainfall; and 100\nkilograms per dunum in the areas that receive\nmore than 200 mm. The Project suggest planting\nrangelands with perennial fodder shrubs in the\nBadia (AlJafr and AlHusseinieh) sub-districts within\nthe Ma’an Governorate.\nn\nn Rangelands Project 2: New Protected\nRangeland Area as Natural Reserve\nThe total area of natural grazing land in the Desert\n(Badia) is approximately 70 million dunum which\nare concentrated in the area that receives less than\n100 mm/year rainfall as short thundershowers\nand rainfall amounts decrease towards the east\nand the south till it reaches 50 mm/year or even\nless. Of these 70 million dunum only 1 million\ndunum is considered as natural reserves. The\nproject suggests increasing the protected area\nby another 100 000 dunum namely in the wide\ndesert valleys south Badia. The project will harness\ndirect benefit for protection of floral biodiversity\nthrough controlling the grazing of the indigenous\nAtriplex halimus shrubs. Much of this area is\ncovered with chert and an underlying thin layer\nof fine textured soil. \nArtemisia herba- alba, Retama raetam, Achillea\nfragrantissima,\nAtriplex\nhalimus and Poa\nbulbosa are common in the wadi beds. Despite\nits deterioration this region is known to be the\nmain grazing land in Jordan. The project will\nachieve reductions through CO2 emissions\noffset from natural soil carbon release caused\nby rangeland deterioration. The project will\nharness direct benefit for soil resources through\nrain harvest techniques as well as soil erosion\ncontrol techniques (erosion is caused from flash\nfloods flow).\nThe average annual dry matter production is 4\nkg/dunum in normal years and when protected\ncan be increased to 15 kg/dunum in the range\nreserves.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ANALYSIS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n113\nIt is assumed to have an average of 35 average\nsized shrub/dunum and the sequestration rate\nis 4 g SOC/m2/year. A lifetime of 15 years will be\nassumed for calculations purposes.\nn\nn Promoting for Climate-smart agricultural\npractices in the Jordan Valley\nClimate smart agriculture is not a new agricultural\nsystem, nor is it a set of practices. It is a new\napproach, a way to guide the needed changes\nof agricultural systems, given the necessity\nto jointly address food security and climate\nchange. It contributes to the achievement of\nsustainable development goals and integrates\nthe three dimensions of sustainable development\n(economic, social and environmental) by jointly\naddressing food security and climate challenges.\nIt is composed of three main pillars: Sustainably\nincreasing agricultural productivity and incomes;\nadapting and building resilience to climate\nchange; reducing and/or removing greenhouse\ngases emissions, where possible.\nSustainable crop production, controlled grazing\nand maintained forest systems can sequester\nsubstantial and variable amounts of carbon\nfrom the atmosphere and store it in soils and\nvegetation. Carbon sequestration will not only\nstabilize climate but will also make agricultural\nincrease the overall resilience of the agroecosystems. Widespread adoption of climate-\nsmart practices has the potential to make major\ncontributions to the achievement of national food\nsecurity and development goals.

The suggested projects will contribute\nin reducing the amount of fuel used for the\nelectricity generation.\nn\nn Biogas Generation By Utilizing The Sludge\nGenerated From Ramtha, Wadi Arab, Baqa, Salt\nAnd Madaba Domestic Wastewater Treatment\nPlant (TNC modified- five projects grouped\ntogether based on similarities)\nA considerable amount of sludge produced\nfrom the wastewater treatment plants without\nany utilization. The five proposed projects aim\nat generating biogas from the sludge and\nconnecting the generated electricity to the\nnational electricity grid. These projects will\ncontribute in reducing the amount of fuel used\nfor the electricity generation.\nThe following assumptions were used during the\nupdate of waste projects:\nn\nn The starting year for implementing the\nproposed projects is 2018.\nn\nn Construction activities, commissioning, and\ntesting will take 1 year (the actual operation\nfor the proposed projects will be in 2019).\nn\nn Density of methane is 0.717 kg/m3.\nn\nn The captured methane from all landfills\nis calculated according to the PRIF study\n(Environment and use of methane from\nmunicipal waste in Amman, 1993), where\nthe average value is used.\nn\nn Electricity-specific emission factors for grid\nelectricity kgCO2/KW adopted from www.\necometric.com\nn\nn The calculation of generated electricity in MW\nis based on 8,000 working hours per year.\nn\nn The generated electricity will be sold at a fixed\nprice of 0.06 JD/kWh.\nn\nn The cost of a 1 MW biogas electricity\ngeneration system (generator, wells, piping,\netc.) is 1,500,000 JD, according to the\nInternational Renewable Energy Agency\n(ARENA).\nn\nn The fixed annual cost is the sum of\nmaintenance, operation, overhead, and\nsupervision costs (10% of capital investment,\naccording to ARENA).\nAll mitigation options under the waste sector\nwere considered as energy measures because the\nbiogas will be used for electric power generation.\nThe cost and the CO2 emission reduction are\nanalyzed for the 9 proposed projects.

In addition to CO2 emissions\nreduction, a cost-benefit analysis has been performed for each proposed mitigation project.\nBased on calculated unit abatement costs and the abatement marginal cost curve, in general; the most\nfeasible options are the energy mitigation projects. The findings indicate that energy efficiency and\nrenewable energy should receive the most attention.

Reporting and verification\nare important for ensuring transparency, good\ngovernance, accountability, and credibility of\nresults, and for building confidence that resources\nare being utilized effectively.\nThis chapter is prepared as part of Jordan’s\nfirst Biennial Update Report to the UNFCCC. It\naddresses three types of MRV, namely:\nn\nn MRV of GHG emissions, conducted at national\nlevel to understand the emissions profile and\nreport it in the form of emissions inventory.\nn\nn MRV of mitigation actions (e.g., policies and\nprojects) to assess GHG mitigation efforts as\nwell as monitor their implementation.\nn\nn MRV of support (e.g., climate finance,\ntechnology transfer, and capacity building) to\ntrack provision and receipt of climate support.\nThis chapter also seeks to describe the current\nstatus of GHG inventory estimation and reporting\nas well as of GHG mitigation. It will also suggest\nan integrated national MRV system for climate\nchange action.\nThe main objective of UNFCCC is to “achieve\nstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations\nin the atmosphere at a level that would prevent\ndangerous anthropogenic interference with the\nclimate system.” The UNFCCC requests reporting\ninformation from countries to have a better\nunderstanding and tracking the progress with\ncommitments or pledges, providing confidence\nand enhancing accountability in quantified\ninformation measured and reported, and\nproviding background information on the scope\nand ambition of national climate responses.\nUNFCCC requirements and IPCC guidance on\nMRV leave considerable flexibility for countries\nto decide how to meet reporting requirements.\nThe IPCC Guidelines also set out methodological\noptions that provide countries with flexibility. This\nflexibility has strong advantages for countries,\nbut it can also affect the quality and details of\nreporting.\nParties to the UNFCCC are obliged to communicate\nto the Conference of the Parties (COP), through the\nSecretariat, information on the actions they have\ntaken or envisage they will take to implement the\nConvention. This is seen as a key implementation\naspect of the Convention, as it allows Parties to\ninform one another of their national level actions\nand serves as a basis for the COP to assess the\nimplementation of the Convention by Parties. The\nreporting provisions contained in the Convention\nwere further enhanced through the Bali Action\nPlan adopted at COP 13 in 2007. The Bali Action\nPlan introduced the principle of MRV for both\ndeveloped and developing country Parties in the\ncontext of enhancing action at the international\nand national level to mitigate climate change.\nThis principle was further elaborated through a\nnumber of subsequent COP decisions, resulting\nin a comprehensive MRV framework under the\nConvention.\nThe Paris Agreement adds the obligation to\nprepare, communicate, and maintain successive\nNDCs and to pursue mitigation actions aligned\nwith these contributions. Key reporting provisions\nof the Paris Agreement are that all Parties shall\nregularly submit national inventory reports and\ninformation on implementation and achievement\nof NDCs, and all Parties shall account for their NDCs.\nThe Paris Agreement also proposes an Enhanced\nTransparency Framework (ETF) as a system for\nMRV of climate action and support. The purpose\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n125\nof the ETF is to provide a clear understanding of\nmitigation actions, track progress towards NDCs,\nand inform a global stocktake to be undertaken\nevery 5 years. The ETF will build on existing\ntransparency mechanisms under the UNFCCC, and\nspecific modalities, procedures, and guidelines\nare being developed for presentation at COP 24\n(2018).\nDeveloping countries mostly submit their\nnational GHG inventory reports through National\nCommunications (NCs) or Biennial Update\nReports (BURs). NCs are to be submitted every 4\nyears and BURs every 2 years, with flexibility for\ncountries based on capacities, data availability,\nand resources available for MRV. Inventory reports\nshould be compiled using methods set out in the\nIPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.\nInventory compilation should adhere to five\nprinciples: transparency, accuracy, completeness,\ncomparability, and consistency. The IPCC\nGuidelines also set out methodological options\nthat provide countries with flexibility. Countries\nshould report on mitigation actions as part of their\nBURs, giving information on methodologies “to\nthe extent possible”.\n4.2 Current Practices at the National\nLevel\nBased on the decisions adopted at COP 16 and 17\nas mentioned previously, non-Annex I Parties now\nneed to measure the specific effects of national\nmitigation actions as well as the support needed\nand received, and to provide this information,\nincluding a national inventory report, as part of\ntheir BURs. Therefore, introducing an MRV system\nin Jordan should be implemented based on the\ncountry’s national circumstances and national\npriorities and built on existing domestic systems\nand capacities while considering the international\nbest practices. It implies institutional improvements\naimed at coordination of all activities for the\ndevelopment of national communications and\nbiennial reports and will seek to define the\nresponsibilities of the authorized body.\n4.2.1 GHG inventories estimation\nThe current practices for the preparation of the\nnational GHG inventories are as follows:\nn\nn The GHG Inventory estimation is prepared\nonly for climate change reporting to the\nUNFCCC (National Communications and\nBURs).\nn\nn The process is not periodical on a set date. The\nactivity is only carried out to fulfil the country’s\ncommitment to UNFCCC Secretariat, and it\nis prepared through national efforts within\nprojects normally supported by GEF-UNDP.\nn\nn To this date, Jordan has prepared GHG national\ninventories for 1994, 2000, and 2006 as well as\nfor 2010 and 2012 as part of the current FBUR.\nn\nn Estimates for the earlier reports were\ndetermined using the Revised 1996 IPCC\nGuidelines, whereas for the current FBUR,\nGHG Inventories for 2010 and 2012 have been\nestimated using 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\nn\nn To this date, the collection of activity data for\nthe GHG Inventory estimation is carried out\nthrough a traditional method. A bottom-up\ndata collection approach is followed for all\nsectors and a top-down approach is followed\nfor the energy sector reference approach.\nn\nn Activity data collection is a long and tedious\nprocess and mostly requires internal personal\nconnections as well as the support of the\nmembers of the National Committee of\nClimate Change.\nn\nn For the activity data collection during each\nNational Communication process and the\ncurrent FBUR, formal letters were issued from\nthe Ministry of Environment (as project owner\nand UNFCCC focal point) to all sister Ministries\nand national stakeholders and institutions\nrequesting activity data. Tables were attached\nto the formal letters describing the needed\ndata and its format (Appendix B includes a list\nof the needed activity data that were used for\nJordan’s national GHG inventory estimation\nand their data sources (entities)).\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n126\nn\nn Follow-up visits were arranged by national\nexperts to ensure getting the needed activity\ndata.\nn\nn The data in most sectors are not readily\navailable in the IPCC format, and they are\noften scattered among multiple departments\nand organizations.\nn\nn At national organizations, data are mostly\nkept as paper copies that might be lost or\ndestroyed.\nn\nn National data for the AFOLU and Waste\nSectors have lots of gaps and there is a\nneed for capacity building in collecting and\ndocumenting data.\nn\nn National Emissions Factors are not available.\n4.2.2 Climate change mitigation\nmeasures tracking\nJordan’s experience with GHG mitigation analysis\nhas been limited to national communications and\nreporting to UNFCCC. In addition, Jordan has\nhad limited experience with clean development\nmechanism (CDM) projects, as stated in the\nProposal for Market Readiness. Out of 15 project\nproposals that received letters of approval from\nthe Ministry of Environment, the Designated\nNational Authority (DNA), only 4 CDM projects\nhave been registered with UNFCCC.\nThe limited CDM experience in Jordan highlights\nthe lack of technical capacity among local experts\non project identification and development\nincluding crediting methodologies, which led\nto increased transaction costs for developing\nCDM projects. In addition to the need to recruit\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation and verification of reductions,\nJordan had to seek an international entity because\nsuch expertise is not available at the local level.\nThe lessons learnt from Jordan’s experience\nwith CDM development indicated that there is\na need to significantly strengthen institutional\nframeworks and technical capacity in order to\ndeliver a pipeline of verified mitigation activities.\nThis includes the need to develop capacities for\ngathering data and for monitoring and verifying\nthe effect of mitigation actions. There is also a need\nto enhance the capacities of decision makers in\nthe public sector.\n4.2.3 Tracking received support\nClimate finance sources at the national level\nNational institutions that are responsible for\nreceiving and distributing climate change funds\ninclude:\nn\nn Ministry of Environment\nn\nn Ministry of Finance\nn\nn Ministry of Planning and International\nCooperation\nn\nn Other Line Ministries\nn\nn Development Banks: AFD, KFW, UNDP, EBRD,\nIFC, EU, etc.\nn\nn Direct aid: USAID, Abu Dhabi Fund for\nEconomic\nDevelopment\nn\nn Specialized climate finance: EBRD, EIB, KfW,\nand Jordan Sustainable Finance Facility\nsupported by EU NIF Grants\nn\nn Domestic public funding: Public sector\nfunding through line Ministries\nn\nn Local funding institutions: Agricultural Credit\nCorporation funding, JEDCO, ACI, CBJ, GDF\nMore details are provided hereafter on the sources\nof finance in Jordan for climate change and green\nprojects.\nn\nn International funding sources: As a developing\neconomy, Jordan has received international\naid from development banks and other\nsources.\nn\nn Development banks are a major source\nof finance for green growth projects and\ninitiatives. The list of development banks\nincludes (though not limited to) the Agence\nFrançaise de Developpement (AFD), KfW,\nthe United Nations Development Program\n(UNDP), the European Bank for Reconstruction\nand Development (EBRD), International\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n127\nFinance Corporation (IFC), the European Union\n(EU), the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic\nDevelopment (KFAED), and others. Aid from\nthese institutions is commonly coordinated\nthrough MOPIC, which plays a key role in\ndonor coordination and project engagement.\nn\nn Direct aid plays a part in Jordan’s green\neconomy sector.\nn\nn Finance sources are various. For example,\nUS alone provides financial aid to Jordan,\nincluding from the following sources that\nare related directly and indirectly to climate\naction:\n-\tEconomic assistance from USAID (approximately\nUSD 1 billion per year), focusing on Jordan’s\nwater infrastructure development.\n-\tMillennium Challenge Account (approximately\nUSD 275 million), which is assisting the\ndevelopment of Jordan’s water efficiency\nand water treatment programs.\n-\tLoan guarantees to assist small and medium\nenterprises (SMEs) in Jordan through various\nmechanisms including the Jordan Loan Fund\nGuarantee to de-risk business loans, which\nis also used by SMEs in the green economy\nsector.\nn\nn Specialized Climate Finance\nJordan receives financial assistance from\nvarious specialized green funds. For example,\nthe Jordan Sustainable Finance Facility has\nbeen recently set up by EBRD, EIB, and KfW,\nand supported by EU NIF grants, with a pilot\nfunding of €34.5million. It is worth mentioning\nthat Jordan has not been as active as other\ndeveloping nations in accessing the increasingly\nimportant climate funds that are being set up\nfor green energy projects. A key example is the\nGlobal Climate Fund, for which as of yet, no\nJordanian entity has been granted eligibility.\nSignificant opportunities exist to access this\nnascent yet very large pool of funds for green\ngrowth projects.\nn\nn Commercial/private financing\nJordan has also been the recipient of direct\nfinancial investment and debt finance from\nthe international commercial banking sector.\nSome of the recent renewables projects,\nincluding the Adenium Energy solar PV plants\nin Ma’an and the Falcon Ma’an for Solar Energy\nproject obtained private financing as part of a\nconsortium of investors. Nearly all renewable\nenergy projects in Jordan have required some\nform of financing or underwriting from key\ninternational development banks or grants.\nDevelopment assistance is provided primarily\nthrough concessional loans, co-financing, or\nequity investments into green growth projects.\nFurthermore, JREEEF has been set up to channel\na range of funding, including international aid\nand development funds, to renewable and\nenergy efficiency projects.\nn\nn Local funding sources\n-\tPublic sector funding: the public sector\nconstitutes the major source of local funding\nfor green projects in Jordan. The majority\nof projects are financed through national\nbudgetary contributions, supported by\ndevelopment partners, including key national\ninfrastructure projects.\n-\tLocal funding institutions such as the\nAgricultural Credit Corporation, a quasigovernment lending facility, supports farmers\noperating under the umbrella of the Ministry\nof Agriculture.\n-\tOther sources of funding that play a role in\nthe financing of the green growth sector in\nJordan include:\nØ Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation (JLGC):\nThe JLGC is sponsored by the Overseas\nPrivate Investment Corporation and is\noperated by the Government Development\nFund. It is a loan guarantee scheme focused\non SME lending.\nØ \nJordan Enterprise Development Corporation\n(JEDCO) – grant funding.\nØ \nAmman Chamber of Industry (ACI) – grant\nfunding.\nØ \n \nCentral Bank of Jordan (CBJ) – loans and\nGovernorates Development Fund (GDF).\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n128\nStatus at the national level\nJordan,\nlike\nother\ndeveloping\ncountries,\nencounters a number of challenges in verifying the\nclimate finance information on support provided\nby developed countries. The current status in\nJordan suffers from the following challenges:\nn\nn Insufficient institutional arrangements: There\nare no sufficient institutional arrangements\nin Jordan that define clear roles and\nresponsibilities of different ministries with\nregard to climate change.\nThe Ministry of Environment is mandated to\ncoordinate climate change-related activities.\nBut it is the activities of other sectoral ministries\nthat are affected by, or have the potential affect,\nclimate change. Furthermore, MOPIC and the\nMinistry of Finance are in the driver’s seat in\ndefining national development priorities and\nformulating the national budget. The national\nbudget does not include a specific allocation\nfor climate change activities. In addition, MOPIC\nand the Ministry of Finance are the entities\nwho engage with development partners and\nhelp maintain records of Official Development\nAssistance (ODA) flowing to various sectors.\nThere also is no effective coordination and\ninformation sharing regarding climate finance\nor integrating climate change into development\nplanning at national, sectoral, and subnational\nlevels.\nn\nn Inconsistent definitions and criteria in\ndefining climate finance and in distinguishing\nclimate finance from other forms of finance\nis a challenge inherent in all climate finance\nmonitoring efforts, whether by a contributor\nor a recipient. The key issue is how to\ndistinguish climate finance from ODA and\nhow to determine the proportion of climate\nfinance that is additional to ODA.\nn\nn Inconsistent markers, indicators, and codes\nto characterize financial data may include:\n-\tDeveloping indicators for adaptation finance\ncan be difficult.\n-\tDeveloping indicators for climate finance is\nespecially challenging for projects that have\nmultiple objectives.\n-\tIndicators are also challenging for cross sectoral\nprojects that include climate-related benefits,\nbut do not primarily focus on climate.\nn\nn Insufficient technical processes and systems\nto identify and record climate finance\nexpenditures (such as reporting formats and\nsoftware platforms for storing and sharing\ninformation) and mechanisms to integrate\nclimate change into national systems for\nbudgeting, monitoring, and reporting.\nn\nn Limitations on the availability of private\nfinancial data.\nHaving an effective monitoring, reporting, and\nverification system for climate finance that\naddresses the gaps and challenges discussed,\nincluding clear roles and responsibilities for\ndifferent actors, can help countries determine\nwhere climate finance is flowing, whether it is\nbeing used in line with its intended purpose, and\ncan facilitate accessing climate change support\nand financing.\n4.3 Suggested Framework for MRV\nThe government of Jordan is committed to\nmeeting the challenge of tackling climate change.\nHaving a strong support and collaboration among\nall stakeholders will ensure a successful transition\ntowards a green, lowcarbon, and sustainable\neconomy.\nThe involvement of all entities in designing a\nrobust multi-level MRV system that possesses the\nrequired flexibility and benefits all, will increase the\nchances of success and long-term sustainability.\nAdopting a systems-based approach including\na clear process design, responsibilities, data\nflows, and a supporting governance structure is\nimportant for the implementation of an effective\nMRV.\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n129\nThe MRV can be best thought of as a system, which\nincludes various elements like process design,\nactivity data flows, governance mechanisms,\nand information technology (IT) support systems.\nIt is suggested to have a legal arrangement in the\nform of by-laws, memorandums of understanding\n(MoUs), and agreements. The agreements or MoUs\nsigned should enable the national focal point to\ndirectly access the data platforms to access the\nactivity data at the Ministries in question. These\nagreements provide certainty about the type of\ndata, the format, and timely access.\nThe IT support system should be designed in close\ncollaboration with all stakeholders and should\nconsider their specific needs. All stakeholders\nshould be involved at early stages and consulted\nin determining the process design, and data flows,\nsuch as what data will be made available, when\nit will be collected, and in what form.\nThe overall purpose of the domestic institutional\narrangements for MRV is to:\nn\nn Meet the reporting requirements of UNFCCC.\nn\nn Further build national capacities and ensure\nthe sustainability of reporting processes.\nn\nn Inform\nnational\nand\ninternational\npolicymakers at different levels.\nn\nn Assist in institutionalizing activities related to\nreporting on climate change.\nThe following subsections describe a framework\nfor a suggested domestic MRV system for climate\naction.\n4.3.1 MRV- GHG inventory emissions\nThe ultimate objective of having an MRV system\nfor emissions is fulfilling UNFCCC obligations to\nreport on levels of GHG emissions by sources and\nremovals by sinks.\nThe MRV system for emissions addresses gathering\ndata for the estimation of GHG emissions by\nsources and removals by sinks to generate a\nnational GHG Inventory, which is reported and\nverified in national communications and biennial\nupdate reports. Data collection, emission factor\nassessment and development, and emissions\ncalculations are of importance. Adopting a systems\napproach will ensure MRV sustainability and will\nimprove transparency, accuracy, comparability,\ncompleteness, and consistency. Planned activities,\nprocedures, methodologies, and responsible\nentities are outlined in Table 4.1.\nSince the national GHG Inventory addresses\ndifferent sectors, the activity data need to be\ncollected from various entities and organizations,\nor data providers. A systems approach that is\ngoverned by solid institutional arrangement\nwould allow well-defined flows of data from data\nproviders to four main sectoral units, which will\nin turn feed the data into the central registry unit\nat the Ministry of Environment, as illustrated in\nFigure 4.1.\nThe data are made available to the registry unit\nat the MoEnv from the sectoral central units on\na biannual basis. The national GHG Inventory\ncompiler will use the data to estimate and report\nthe national GHG Inventory annually, according to\nUNFCCC guidelines and the IPCC software.\nThe GHG Inventory is then subjected to multiple\nreviews by national and international accredited\nbodies, such as the UNEP-UNDP Global Support\nprogram (GSP), academic institutions, or local\nresearch entities. The inventory is then submitted\nto UNFCCC Secretariat for final verification and\napproval as part of the NCs and BURs, as illustrated\nin Figure 4.2.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n130\nTable 4.1: Suggested design for MRV of GHG inventory emissions\nMRV for GHG\nInventory\nEmissions\nThe ultimate objective of having an MRV system for emissions is fulfilling\nUNFCCC obligations to report on levels of GHG emissions by sources and\nremovals by sinks.\nThe MRV system for emissions deals with gathering data for the measurement\nof GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks to generate a national\nGHG Inventory, which is reported and verified in national communications\nand biennial update reports.\nLead institution\nMinistry of Environment\nInstitutions\ninvolved in\nprocess\nLine ministries, GAM, and data providers\nProcedure\nMeasurement - collection of activity data\nMinistry of Environment has MoUs with: MEMR, Chamber of Industry, and\nDOS to provide data on a biannual basis.\n-\tMEMR has MOUs with energy sector data providers.\n-\tDOS has MOUs with AFOLU and waste sector data providers.\n-\tChamber of Industry has MOUs with IPPU data providers.\nReporting - GHG inventory estimation\n-\tUsing the IPCC Guidelines for the estimation of GHG emissions from various\nsectors.\n-\tCompilation of the overall national GHG Inventory by the Ministry of\nEnvironment.\nVerification\n-\tLocal technical review.\n-\tInternational review by an accredited/referenced entity, e.g., UNDP-UNEP\nGlobal Support Programme (GSP).\nMethodology\nfor estimation\nThe methodologies for measurement are not defined by the Convention.

Defining\na reasonable baseline scenario is considered a\ncritical element in the abatement assessment\nsince the benefits and incremental costs of\nmitigation options are directly linked to a\nsound definition of the baseline scenario.\nn\nn The mitigation scenario is structured according\nto a set of criteria reflecting country-specific\nconditions such as the potential for a large\nchange on GHG emissions, direct and indirect\neconomic impacts, consistency with national\ndevelopment goals, potential effectiveness of\nimplementation policies, sustainability of an\noption, data availability for evaluation, and\nother sector-specific criteria.\nThe methodologies for measurement are not\ndefined by the Convention. In undertaking\nemissions\nmanagement,\nParties\ncould\nrely on methodologies developed by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) (e.g., IPCC 1996/2006) or GHG Protocol\ncalculation tools and standards.\nThe GHG mitigation measures are planned and\nimplemented by the project owner with external\ntechnical support, if needed. Baseline, mitigation,\nand feasibility analysis must be performed and\nreported to and with the support of the registry\n(activity data unit at the MoEnv). Planned activities,\nprocedures, methodologies, and responsible\nentities are outlined in Table 4.2.\nThe implementation of planned activities is\nmonitored by the Ministry of Environment.

It is recommended to collect\nthe data as follows:\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ninternational support for the public sector\nthrough MoPIC. Public sector organizations\ninclude:\n-\tMinistries such as MWI, MEMR, MOA, MOH,\nMOE, MOT, MOMA, and MOIT.\n-\tGAM and other municipalities.\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ninternational support for universities through\nthe Ministry of Higher Education.\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ninternational support for NGOs through the\nMinistry of Social Development.\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on loans\nfrom banks for green projects through the\nCentral Bank of Jordan (CBJ).\nn\nn Measurement and reporting data on\ncommercial/private financing, direct financial\ninvestment, and debt finance through the\npublic-private partnership (PPP) unit at the\nMinistry of Finance.\nThe task of verification of received support is\nsuggested to be the responsibility of MoPIC.\nPlanned activities, procedures, methodologies,\nand responsible entities are outlined in Table 4.3.\nA diagram illustrating a suggested MRV System\nfor Received Support is shown in Figure 4.4.\nThe above framework system for support is in line\nwith the recommendation of the Green Economy\nStrategy of having a standalone, independent\nunit or team (such as the Green Economy Unit at\nthe MoEnv) to provide technical assistance with\nregard to green finance to the government under\npatronage of the Ministerial Council.\nThe mandate of this unit as suggested by the\nGreen Economy Strategy is to:\nØAdvise on and support progress on all finance\nmatters for green growth projects in Jordan.\nØBuild capacity of key government and regulatory\nstakeholders through training and awareness\nraising.\nØAct as facilitators in project development,\noffering expert advice and support as a public\nservice to loan or grant applicants. A number\nof promising green projects never make it\nto a “bankable” project, as stakeholders lack\nexperience. Providing this expertise can be a\nvalue-added service to the Jordanian market.\nØAct as technical advisors to fund providers who\nwant to act as lenders, equity investors, or loan\nguarantors.\nØDevelop and execute an engagement and\nawareness “roadshow” for private sector\nstakeholders in and outside of Jordan to attract\ninterest in financing green growth projects in\nJordan.\nIn addition to the finance technical assistance\nmandate, it is suggested to add tracking and\nreporting mandate for climate finance. It is needed\nto work towards increased transparency and clear\ndefinitions for climate finance spanning both the\ntype of flows to be included (public and private)\nand the types of activities that are eligible to be\ntracked (e.g., mitigation, adaptation, enabling\nactivities, reporting). Thus, the unit that oversees\nthe MRV for support (Green Economy Unit) needs\nto elaborate on how the unit plans to achieve a\npractical efficient MRV tracking system for climate\nfinance, which may include:\nn\nn Creating definitions and criteria to define\nclimate finance (distinguishing climate\nfinance from other forms of finance). This can\nbe coordinated with MoEnv, climate change\ndirectorate team.\nn\nn The need to decide on the level of detail for\na classification system, as follows:\n-\tA broad classification system may consider only\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n137\nwhether an activity is identified as being an\nadaption or a mitigation project.\n-\t   A second level of detail could consider\nmitigation activities by sector - for example,\nenergy,\nforestry,\ntransportation,\nor\nmanufacturing.\n- A further layer of detail may look at subsectors.\nFor example, energy-sector activities may\nbe subdivided by technology: wind, solar,\ngeothermal, nuclear, and so on. Jordan will\nhave to determine a level of detail that is\npractical, and which meets its internal policy\nneeds. Moreover, Jordan will need to consider\nhow to identify climate adaptation projects,\nwith respect to national development plans\nand programs and development assistance\nprojects.\nn\nn Defining clear and well-defined roles and\nresponsibilities for the preparation of GHG\ninventory estimates (both internally and\nexternally), a quality assurance/quality\ncontrol plan, a working archive system, and\na description of the process for collecting data\nand developing GHG inventory estimates.\nTable 4.3: Suggested design of an MRV system for received support\nMRV for\nSupport\nThe objective of the MRV system for support (namely, climate finance,\ntechnology transfer, and capacity building) is to track provision and receipt\nof climate support and monitor the results achieved, and assess their impact.\nLead institution\nMinistry of Environment\nInstitutions\ninvolved in\nprocess\nMoPIC, Line Ministries, GAM, project owners and data providers\nProcedure\nPreparation of a national regulation that provides guidance on measuring,\ntracking, and reporting of climate change received support.\nMethodology\nfor estimation\nThe methodologies for measurement are not defined by the Convention.\nParties are free to create their own methodologies that suits their national\ncircumstances.\nMeasurement- collection of activity data\n-\tMinistry of Environment prepare MoUs with data providers\nResources,\ncapacities, staff,\nand tools\nn\nn Dedicated staff for data collection at each central unit.\nn\nn Templates for measurements, reporting, and verification.\nn\nn IT tools and database platforms for data storage and reporting.\nTimeframe\nBiannual effort to generate an annual report.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\n138\nFigure 4.4: Suggested MRV system for received support\nRegistry Unit - MRV of Support\n( at Green Economy Unit - MoEnV )\nData Feed in from the central units\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\ninternational\nsupport for Public\nMoPIC :\nPublic Sector\nInclude :\n- Ministries such\nas MWI, MEMR,\nMOA ,MOH,\nMOE, MOT\nMOMA and\nMOIT\n- GAM and other\nMunicipalities.\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\ninternational\nsupport for\nUniversities\nthrough:\n( Ministry of\nHigher\nEducation )\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\ninternational\nsupport for\nNGOs through:\n( Ministry of\nSocial\nDevelopment )\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\nLoans from Banks\nfor Green Projects\nthrough:\nCentral Bank of\nJordan\nMeasurement and\nreporting data on\nCommercial /\nPrivate Financing\ndirect ﬁnancial\ninvestment and\ndebt ﬁnance\nthrough\n( PPP Unit at MOF )\nVeriﬁcation - thorugh MoPIC\n\nDOMESTIC MEASUREMENT, REPORTING, AND VERIFICATION\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n139\n4.3.4 Suggested overall domestic\nMRV system\nThe overall MRV system will be under the\nlead of the Ministry of Environment, where all\ninformation should feed in to the Climate Change\nDirectorate and green economy unit.

It will also identify newly arising\nconstraints and gaps, and needed actions and\nresources required to overcome them.\n5.2 Institutional Constraints and Gaps\nand Policy Mainstreaming\nJordan is continuously striving to improve national\nGHG estimation and reporting to the UNFCCC.\nTo achieve continuous improvement in national\nreporting, constraints, gaps, and related financial,\ntechnical, and capacity building, needs should be\nidentified, and appropriate measures taken and\nimplemented to address them.\nIn order to fulfil the obligations arising from\nthe Cancun and Durban Conference of Parties\n(COP) decisions related to the submission of\nnational communications and biennial update\nreports, further support is needed to continue\nto develop and consolidate existing technical\nand institutional capacities and to continue the\nefforts of integrating climate change into national\npolicies, plans, and programs.\nIn 2013, a milestone was achieved in Jordan with\nthe launch and adoption of the first National\nClimate Change Policy (NCCP) in the country\nand in the region. The policy was drafted to\naccommodate all national climate change\npriorities for action and to provide a highly\nflexible policy reference point, upon which further\nstrategies and sectoral policies can be based. The\nimplementation of NCCP relies on the framework\nof the laws, agendas, and strategies developed by\nthe related ministries and authorities to provide\nan enabling environment.\n In August 2014, the Ministry of Environment has\ncreated the Directorate of Climate Change (CCD).\nThe Directorate acts as the institutional hub for\ncoordinating and developing all climate change\nactivities in Jordan in relation to the UNFCCC and\nthe global climate change governance system and\ninitiatives. According to the recently approved\ninstitutional framework, the overall objective of\nthe Climate Change Directorate is to follow-up on\nand strengthen the implementation of provisions\nof UNFCCC and any related legal instruments that\nthe COP may adopt and which Jordan ratifies.\nThe creation of the CCD has been a milestone in\nimproving the institutional structure of climate\nchange in Jordan. However, the Directorate\nshould be strengthened by adding more staff\nand enhancing their capacities.\nFurthermore, a representative National Committee\non Climate Change (NCCC) has been established in\nApril 2001 by a decision by the Prime Minister. NCCC\nmembership includes a number of stakeholders\ndirectly associated with climate change related\nsectors in Jordan. Current NCCC members\nrepresent line ministries, public institutions,\nresearch and academic organizations, and NGOs.\nThe NCCC is a platform for the integration of multistakeholder dialogue and planning on climate\nchange. Currently, the terms of reference and\nmandate of the NCCC are under review by MoEnv\nto enhance its role and mandate and facilitate\nthe exchange of data and information among\ncommittee members.\nPublic policy in Jordan has not adopted a national\nGHG emissions target. The Intended Nationally\nDetermined Contribution (INDCs), submitted in\n2015, proposes to reduce Jordan’s GHG emissions\nby 14% by 2030, driven by sectoral policies. Jordan\ntends to promote mitigation measures that are\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n143\njustified by objectives other than climate change\nstabilization, such as cost-effectiveness, energy\nsecurity, economic competitiveness, reducing\nenergy expenses, and improving access to energy\nservices.\n5.3 Technical and Capacity Building\nNeeds\n5.3.1 GHG inventory\n5.3.1.1 Gaps and constraints\nidentified during the previous\nnational communications and\nrecommendation to address them\na) Gaps, constraints, and capacity building\nneeds identified during the previous National\nCommunications (NCs):\n-\tPreviously, GHG inventories were estimated\nonly as part of the NCs preparation project ,\nand thus lacked continuity and sustainability.\nData were collected by sending paper letters\nrequesting data from potential data providers,\na process that was both time consuming\nand tedious. This arrangement does not\nserve national efforts to prepare periodical\ninventories for NCs and BURs to the UNFCCC.\n-\tThere was a lack of institutional arrangement\nto support collection of data needed for\nestimating the national GHG inventory,\nparticularly from the private and industrial\nsector.\n-\tData quality, completeness, and accuracy were\na primary concern. In addition, most data were\navailable in a format not suitable for GHG\ninventory estimation. The lack of disaggregate\ndata was a barrier to improving the bottom\nup estimation.\n-\tAll stakeholders experienced shortage in\ntechnical staff proficient in converting raw\nprimary data to a form that can readily be\nused by the GHG inventory software.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\nAs part of the FBUR project, a framework for a\ndomestic MRV system for GHG Emissions Inventory\nhas been suggested to address most of the above\ngaps, constrains, and needs, as follows:\n-\tA dedicated entity is suggested to be created\nto oversee collection and processing of data\nfor GHG estimation by setting up institutional\narrangements and clear responsibilities and\nmandates.\n-\tThe institutional arrangements shall ensure the\ncontinuous and sustainable flow of data from\nall governmental and private data providers\nto be used for periodical BURs, NCs, and GHG\ninventory estimation as well as for any other\npurposes.\n-\tThe suggested MRV system for GHG emissions\nwill ensure verification of data to ensure\nquality, accuracy, and completeness.\n-\tA national effort is ongoing supported by the\nPartnership for Market Readiness to design\nand implement a detailed multi-level MRV\nsystem.\n5.3.1.2 Additional gaps and constraints\nnewly identified during the current\nbur and recommendations to address\nthem\na) Additional gaps and constraints newly identified\nduring the current BUR:\n-\tThere is a need to build capacity in the use of\nthe 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Software.\n-\tThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and 2012\ndid not provide emission estimates for indirect\nGHGs such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen\noxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic\ncompounds (NMVOC), and other gases not\ncontrolled by the Montreal Protocol, such as\nsulphur oxides (SOx) because the 2006 IPCC\nSoftware does not support the estimation of\nthose gases.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n144\n-\tThe National GHG Inventories of 2010 and\n2012 have been estimated using the 2006\nIPCC Guidelines, which have structural and\nmethodological differences with the Revised\n1996 IPCC Guidelines used in estimating GHG\nemissions inventories for earlier national\ncommunications (NCs), which made it difficult\nto provide a consistent time series.\n-\tIn preparing all GHG inventories so far, default\nemission factors (EFs) were used since there\nare no available studies to develop national\nemission factors. The use of national EFs is\nhighly vital, particularly for key categories\nwithin the inventory.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\n-\tIt is recommended to conduct training\nand capacity building workshops on the\npreparation of GHG inventories, including\ndetailed use of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and\ndata sheets and calculations. This will widen\nthe base of national experts. As part of the\ncurrent BUR effort, capacity building activities\nhave been held for use of the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines and Software. However, further\ncapacity building for use of these guidelines\nis still needed, given that the Guidelines have\nbeen used for the first time in preparing the\nFBUR.\n-\tAs per Decision 17/CP.8, non-Annex I Parties\nare encouraged, as appropriate, to report\non anthropogenic emissions of indirect\nGHGs and other gases not controlled by the\nMontreal Protocol, at the discretion of the\nParties. To fulfill this decision requirement and\nto improve the completeness of the inventory,\nit is recommended to estimate the emissions\nof these gases using EMEP/EEA air pollutant\nemission inventory guidebook.\n-\tIn Decision 2 CP.17, each non-Annex I Party is\nencouraged to provide a consistent time series\nback to the years reported in the previous\nNCs. Therefore, it is recommended to use the\n2006 IPCC Software to re-report the previous\nnational communications’ inventories.\n-\tA key category analysis has been performed\nas part of this BUR. It is recommended that\nJordan search for alternatives to gradually\napply in future inventory submissions, to\nthe extent possible and based on software\nreadiness and national circumstances, Tier 2\nmethods in the categories identified as key.\nThus, research should be directed to develop\nnational emission factors to be able to use\nhigher tiers for key categories.\n5.3.2 GHG mitigation measures\n5.3.2.1 Gaps and constraints\nidentified during the previous\nnational communications and\nrecommendations to address them\na) Gaps, constraints, and capacity building needs\nidentified during the previous NCs:\n-\tStakeholders had limited expertise in and\nknowledge capacity for conducting mitigation\nanalysis for the transportation, IPPU, AFOLU,\nand waste sectors.\n-\tThe complex nature of mitigation actions\nand initiatives that are being developed\nand implemented within the UNFCCC had\nbeen a challenge. The various potentials\nand features of CDM, NAMAs, LEDs, INDCs,\nand other mitigation tools make it difficult\nfor a holistic planning perspective in climate\nchange mitigation.\n-\tData quality, completeness, and accuracy\nare of a primary concern when it comes to\nestablishing the baseline and mitigation\nanalysis. Data are not up to date, nor are they\nreadily available in one place.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\n-\tIt is recommended to expand the expertise base\nand the knowledge capacity for conducting\nmitigation analysis through an extensive\ntraining program.\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n145\n-\tIt is recommended to raise awareness on\ninternational\nmitigation\nmechanisms\nand initiatives among all decision makers\nand stakeholders to benefit from those\nmechanisms. It is also recommended that\nthe MoEnv continue to provide support\nfor technical capacity building related to\naccessing those mechanisms.\n-\tIt is recommended to conduct continuous and\nup to date surveys to provide quality and\naccurate data to be used for analysis.\n-\tAs part of the FBUR project, a framework for a\ndomestic MRV system for GHG Mitigation has\nbeen suggested that addresses most of the\nabove gaps, constrains, and needs, as follows:\nØA dedicated entity is suggested to be created\nto oversee collection and processing of data\nfor GHG estimation by setting up institutional\narrangements and clear responsibilities and\nmandates.\nØThe suggested MRV system for GHG emissions\nwill ensure verification of data to ensure quality,\naccuracy, and completeness.\nØA national effort is ongoing supported by the\nPartnership for Market Readiness to design and\nimplement a detailed multi-level MRV system.\n5.3.2.2 Additional gaps and\nconstraints newly identified\nduring the current BUR and\nrecommendations to address them\na) Additional gaps and constraints newly identified\nduring the current BUR:\n-\tThere is limited experience in Jordan in\nmitigation model analysis. The LEAP software,\nwhich replaced the more familiar ENPEP\nmodel, has just been newly introduced to\nJordan for use in climate change energy\nmitigation analysis.\n-\tThe Jordanian case built in this current FBUR\nusing the LEAP model has been developed\nas project-based rather than as a programbased scenario.\n-\tIn this FBUR, no mitigation projects have\nbeen identified for the transportation\nsector, although it is a major GHG emitter.\nAddressing the transportation sector has\nproved to be difficult because of the lack of\nexpertise in mitigation analysis and of clarity\nin responsibilities and mandates among\ndifferent institutions working within the\nsector.\n-\tIn preparing this FBUR, the energy data used\nin the mitigation analysis for residential\nbuildings, transportation, agriculture, and offroad vehicles were obtained from relatively\nold surveys and there were gaps in the\navailability of some data.\n-\tThere is a need to have a dependable mitigation\ntracking system for planning, implementation,\nand verification of emissions reduction.\nHaving such a system in place will facilitate\naccess to international and national funds\nand grants.\nb) Suggested actions and recommendations to\naddress the gaps and needs:\n-\tAs part of current BUR capacity building\nactivities, two training workshops have been\nheld on the use of LEAP, but further training\nin using the LEAP model use is needed.\n-\tThe Jordanian case built in this current FBUR\nusing the LEAP model should be adopted\nand\nfurther\ndeveloped\nin\nupcoming\nnational communications and BURs. It is also\nrecommended to start using LEAP to generate\nprogram based scenarios rather than project\nbased scenarios to improve coverage and\ngenerate more impact.\n-\tThe transportation sector is a major GHG emitter\nand therefore, there is a need to suggest\nmitigation projects and programs. Capacity\nbuilding among all institutions working within\nthe sector should be developed to perform\nmitigation analysis.\n-\tIt is recommended to have up to date surveys\nthat provide current data on a continuous\nbasis.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n146\n5.4 Technology Needs Assessment\nand Technology Transfer\nThe Ministry of Environment, with GEF-UNDP\nsupport, has earlier published a technology needs\nassessment (TNA) and technology transfer report\nfor 2004-2005. More recently, the Ministry has\ncompleted a climate change technology needs\nassessment for Jordan for the period 2015-2017.\nThe project is being implemented through\na partnership between the United Nations\nEnvironment Program (UNEP) and the Technical\nUniversity of Denmark (DTU), and is known as\nUNEP-DTU Partnership. Three reports have been\npublished by this project. The first report is for the\nselection of priority mitigation and adaptation\nsectors for TNA activities in Jordan. The second\nreport presented a list of the main barriers and\nan enabling framework, while the third report,\nwhich was published in August 2017, offered a\ntechnology action plan for two priority mitigation\nsectors (energy and transport) and two priority\nadaptation sectors (water and agriculture). The\nfollowing TNA analysis is extracted from the three\npublished reports.\nResults revealed the following top three\ntechnologies, prioritized, out of a long initial roster\nof assessed technologies in each targeted sector.\nThe top three mitigation technologies for the\nenergy sector were:\n(1) Solar thermal,\n(2) PV for electrification, and\n(3) PV for water pumping.\nThe three top-ranked priority mitigation\ntechnologies for the transportation sector were:\n(1) Bus Rapid Transit,\n(2) Improving pedestrian infrastructure, and\n(3)  Ticketing systems to improve the quality\nand the attractiveness of public transport\nservices.\nThe final results for the water sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Roof-top rainwater harvesting,\n(2) Augmenting and expansion of Water Users\nAssociation (WUAs), and\n(3) Desalination and brackish water treatment\nand re-use.\nThe results for the agricultural sector’s top three\npriority adaptation technologies were:\n(1) Water saving technologies, such as drip or\nsubsurface irrigation,\n(2) Farm-level water harvesting, and\n(3) Plant varieties resistant to climate change.\nThe report has also provided a combined\ntechnology action plan (TAP) for the three priority\ntechnologies for each sector and key projects have\nbeen suggested to turn ideas into action.\nEnergy Sector\nThe main actions proposed are:\nn\nn Removal of financial and economic barriers;\nn\nn Enforcement of standards;\nn\nn Focused training programs; and\nn\nn Effective awareness programs.\nThe following three main project ideas have been\nsuggested:\nn\nn Designing financial support mechanisms and\nsubsidizes for solar powered systems;\nn\nn Developing a complete PV process industry;\nfrom silicon to module;\nn\nn Developing a high-tech comprehensive solar\nthermal industry; flat, evacuated tube, and\nparabolic trough technologies.\nTransportation Sector\nThe main actions proposed are:\nn\nn Introducing regulations that incentivize users\nand potential users of public transportation;\nn\nn Planning strategic rehabilitation of the main\nstreets that will contain BRT lanes;\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n147\nn\nn Institutionalizing the roles of stakeholders;\nn\nn Organizing capacity building programs for\ndrivers and operators; and\nn\nn Organizing a broad awareness campaign to\nincentivize users and the potential users of\npublic transportation.\nThe following three main project ideas have been\nsuggested:\nn\nn Establishing a new sustainable transportation\ngraduate course of study (Master degree\nprogram) at Jordanian universities to train\npractitioners in this understaffed field;\nn\nn Planning a public transportation project\nbetween Amman and Irbid;\nn\nn Modernizing public transportation vehicles.\nWater Sector\nThe three technologies prioritized in the\nwater sector have distinctive characteristics\nand independent applied aspects in terms of\nresources, management modalities, beneficiary\ngroups, and stakeholders involved as well as\nunique technical and governance barriers. Thus,\nthe three technologies were addressed and\nassessed separately. Moreover, each technology\nhas its unique scale and context of deployment\nas follows:\nRoof-top rain water harvesting (RWH)\ntechnology:\nAmong the actions proposed for this technology\nare:\nn\nn Conducting a technical assessment and\nscreening study to identify the most\nappropriate modality of RWH technology for\ndifferent types of building settings in Jordan;\nn\nn Revising or developing a new water efficiency\ncode/by-law for buildings to regulate water\nefficiency measures including RWH. The\nproposed code would address regulatory\nincentives such as tax cuts and fees deduction\nto encourage compliance by housing\nconstruction companies with RWH directives\n(building codes) and enhance feasibility and\npayback period;\nn\nn Developing awareness and information\ndissemination programs targeting relevant\nbodies (Ministry of Water and Irrigation,\nJordan Engineers Association, Contractors\nAssociation).\nSome actions inspired new project ideas. For\nexample, the TAP for RWH inspired a proposal to\nestablish a Regional Green Building Engineering\nTraining Center in Jordan, which will be a\nfully-fledged demonstration green building\nwith installed RWH technology among other\nsustainable building-oriented technologies (such\nas greywater, insulation, RE & EE technologies).\nEmpowerment and Expansion of WUAs\nTechnology\nAmong the actions proposed for this technology\nare:\nn\nn Having a suitable law governing WUAs to\nempower its operations in Jordan;\nn\nn Strengthening WUAs to enable them to\nperform the mandated tasks (irrigation\nmanagement transfer);\nn\nn Attaining effective means of financial\nsustainability for WUAs and building their\ncapacity to develop income-generating\nactivities and projects;\nn\nn Establishing a program for continuous\ntraining and capacity building and developing\neffective coordination and communication\nplatforms for WUAs in the Jordan Valley;\nn\nn Developing capacity building programs to\nempower WUAs in marketing the concept\nof WUA as an innovation in participatory\nirrigation management, and improving the\nskills of WUAs in marketing their products;\nIt is expected that the above actions will become\ncomponents of one mega program seeking to\naccelerate full irrigation management transfer\nto the WUAs throughout the Jordan Valley. This\nwill contribute to removing the barriers for WUAs\nand facilitate its expansion in other parts of the\ncountry, such as southern Jordan.\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n148\nDesalination and Brackish Water Treatment\nand Re-use\nBecause investment in these technologies requires\na high capital cost, the scale for potential diffusion\nof this technology will be confined to a pilot site\nof promising readiness and preference for the\nauthorities in charge (Water Authority of Jordan).\nAmong the actions proposed for this technology\nare:\nn\nn Promoting reasonable system prices for\ncapital and operating costs through costeffective desalination units integrated with\nenergy solutions (such as solar energy);\nn\nn Promoting and providing incentives to locallyproduced and assembled desalination units;\nand\nn\nn Promoting technologies of less environmental\nimpact.\nA well identified project idea for this technology\nis the installation of a PV-powered desalination\nplant with a capacity 3-3.5 MCM/year to be utilized\nfor drinking water supply to Amman and the local\narea. A suggested site is the Al Husban Well Field\n(a set of 4 groundwater wells on the Dead Sea\nGroundwater Basin).\nAgriculture Sector\nThe three technologies prioritized in the\nagricultural sector have distinctive characteristics\nand independent applied aspects in terms of\nresources, management modalities, beneficiary\ngroups, and stakeholders involved, as well as\nunique technical and governance barriers.\nThus, the three technologies were addressed and\nassessed separately as well.\nApplication of Water Saving Technologies,\nsuch as Drip or Subsurface Irrigation\nTechnology\nThe ambition for said technologies was set as\na target: “Increase the irrigated areas in the\nJordan Valley and Highlands using water saving\ntechnologies to 60,000 hectares by 2030”. The\nambition also extends to expanding water\nharvesting activities to the catchments of dry areas\nand the Badia region to deliver socio-economic\nand environmental benefits in the arable areas.\nTo that end, the following actions are proposed\nfor this technology:\nn\nn Improving agricultural extension services\nsignificantly to provide necessary advisory\nservices and capacity building activities on\nthe advantages of the technology;\nn\nn Developing capacity building campaigns\ntargeting farmers;\nn\nn Providing economic incentives and subsidized\ntariffs for water saving irrigation practices in\norder to increase efficient use by land-owners\nand farmers;\nFarm-level Water Harvesting\nThe scale and ambition for this technology is\ncentered in local catchments in dry areas and the\nBadia region. Thus, among the actions proposed\nfor this technology are:\nn\nn Implementation\nof\npilot\nprojects\nto\ndemonstrate\nthe\nadvantages\nof\nthe\ntechnology;\nn\nn Enabling provision of long-term and lowinterest loans or grants through state\nfunds, private sources (different banks), and\ninternational funds (WB, IFAD, GEF, GCF,\nAdaptation Fund); and\nn\nn Supporting the creation of a stakeholder\nnetwork for the development and transfer\nof the technology through a network of\ntechnical experts.\nIntroduction (or Promotion) of Plant\nVarieties Resistant (Adaptive) to Climate\nChange\nThe scale of application for this technology will\nbe restricted to rain-fed agricultural areas, where\ncereal-legume cropping systems are predominant.\nTherefore, the following actions are proposed for\nthis technology:\nn\nn Establishing modern breeding programs to\nproduce climate change resilient varieties\nin collaboration with multinational and\ninternational organizations;\n\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n149\nn\nn Developing specific subsidy mechanisms\nand incentives to the farmers to promote the\nutilization and dissemination of the climate\nchange resilient crop varieties;\nn\nn Strengthening institutional capacity; and\nn\nn Promoting knowledge transfer and increasing\npublic awareness regarding the benefits of\nimproved varieties.\n5.5 Financial Resources Needs\nAccording to the National Environmental and\nEconomic Development Study for Climate Change\n(NEEDS) study published in Jordan in 2010, both\nmitigation and adaptation measures in Jordan will\nrequire substantial financial resources. The study\nestimates that USD 3.5 billion will be needed for\nmitigation until 2020. With only 0.5% of the public\nbudget allocated to projects in the environmental\nsector (apart from infrastructure investments in\nwater and energy), considerable fundraising\ntargets are required.\nThe Government of Jordan has proposed sectoral\nmitigation policies and programs to achieve a 14%\nreduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared\nto the baseline scenario. The 14% reduction of\nGHG emissions is divided into two parts. The first\npart seeks to achieve a 1.5% reduction in GHG\nemissions through unilateral actions, while the\nremaining 12.5% reduction is contingent and\nconditional on receiving international financial\nsupport. In its INDCs, Jordan put the estimate of\nreducing GHG emissions by 14% at USD 5.7 billion.\nTo finance mitigation measures in the energy\nsector, Jordan will require USD 5,158 million to\nmeet its conditional mitigation targets. While a\nsignificant proportion of this is likely to come from\ninternational sources of finance, one of the key\nsectoral actions for the energy sector is attracting\nprivate sector finance and reducing administrative\nobstacles in order to enable JREEEF to support\ninvestments at early stages.\nThe key challenges in financing climate\nchange projects, particularly EE and RE\nn\nn Banks in Jordan, in general, are interested\nin providing finance to RE and EE projects.\nBanks prefer financing RE projects, particularly\nthose which are of a larger size and linked to\ntheir existing client base. EE and smaller sized\nprojects are less preferred.\nn\nn To minimize risks, financiers need access to\nan independent, credible reference body for\nthe accreditation of climate change projects,\nparticularly RE and EE projects. However,\ntechnical verifiers are unavailable, and\nfinanciers lack technical capacity.\nn\nn There is a lack of appropriate financial\nproducts.\nn\nn Project developers lack technical capacity.\nThe work of public financing institutions, such as\nJREEEF and JEF, although small scale, could play a\ncrucial role in promoting early stage investments,\nparticularly for public private partnership (PPP)\nprojects, and for projects with co-financing.\nThe Jordan Environment Fund (JEF) lacked the\nneeded financial and administrate autonomy to\nbe able to carry out its mandate effectively and\nefficiently. JREEEF is now active and has full and\nadequate institutional, technical, and financial\ncapacity to manage the fund, buttressed by a\nmanagement committee, supportive legislation\n(JREEEF By-Law), a transparent and effective\ngovernance structure, a strategic business plan,\nand financial support windows. For JEF to fund\nmitigation activities will require a widening of\nits current role to include a specific focus on\nmitigation activity, and the development of\nproject selection criteria including an assessment\nof projects’ impact on GHG emissions. In addition,\nJEF currently lacks adequate human, technical, and\nfinancial capability to perform its current role, let\nalone an expanded role.\nThe majority of financial resources pumped into\nenvironmental sectors in Jordan come from donor\ncountries through bilateral agreements that\nfocus on fiscal and developmental challenges\nin the country. Framework agreements and\nstrategies with major donors like UNDP, USAID,\n\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\nUPDATED GAPS AND CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATED NEEDS\n150\nEU, GIZ, JICA, and other agencies have been\ndeveloped and address a variety of sustainable\ndevelopment objectives. The donor community\nis supportive of a public registry of projects which\nwould allow transparency and coordination of\nongoing activities, as well as the assessment of\ntheir cost effectiveness. In addition, these donors\nare particularly supportive of developing strong\nGHG MRV frameworks, believed to be key to\ndemonstrating the effectiveness climate financing.\nFinancial institutions and banks are interested in\nentering this new sector. Several green loans\nand programs are being established and green\nsuppliers and manufacturers are growing in\nnumber. However, the market lacks proactive\nmarketing and public outreach.\nCurrently, there is 112 million JD available for RE\nand EE financing in Jordan. Of this amount, 76\nmillion JD is available through the four commercial\nbanks using the Central Bank of Jordan’s window\nfor RE and EE, and 36 million JD is available through\nthe Agence Français de Development (AFD)\nfacility. Key challenges in disbursing these funds\ninclude the lack of credible market references and\na short credit history. This is particularly a relatively\nnew field and while some banks have already\nestablished designated credit lines, other banks\nare still on the fence. A particular challenge for\nthem is the lack of sufficient knowledge to verify\nproject assumptions, technologies, or risks. They\nneed access to an independent, credible reference\nbody for the accreditation of RE and EE projects.\nThe following are suggested actions and\nrecommendations to address those gaps\nand needs:\nn\nn As part of the FBUR project, a framework for\na domestic MRV system for Received Support\nwas suggested that addresses most of the\nabove gaps, constrains, and needs by:\nØEstablishing a dedicated entity to oversee\ncollecting and verifying received support\ninformation related to climate change.\nØDesigning and implementing a national\nmulti-level MRV system, supported by the\nPartnership for Market Readiness.\nn\nn It is recommended top raise the capacities\nof stakeholders to produce bankable viable\nprojects.\nn\nn It is recommended to raise the awareness of\nbankers of technical projects evaluation and\nassessment.\n5.6 Financial and Technical Support\nProvided by GEF Related to Climate\nChange\nThe Global Environment Facility (GEF) supported\nJordan financially in executing the following\nclimate change activities:\nn\nn Preparation\nof\nthe\nInitial\nNational\nCommunication (INC), prepared by the\nGeneral\nCorporation\nfor\nEnvironment\nProtection (GCEP) (which later became the\nMinistry\nof\nEnvironment),\n1996-1997.\nn\nn",
