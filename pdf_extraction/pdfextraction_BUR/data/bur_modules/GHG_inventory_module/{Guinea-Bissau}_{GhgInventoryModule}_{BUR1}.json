It is within\nthis context that on behalf of the Government of The Republic of GuineaBissau I wish to present the Country’s Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update\nReport to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nThe report covers insightful data and information as well as an analysis on\nfinancial, technical and capacity building support received versus the\nidentified constraints and gaps, financial, technical and capacity-building needs. As a signatory to the UNFCCC,\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau has already been implementing domestic policies and actions to tackle climate\nchange. The PRSP II proposal TERRA RANKA Strategic Document 2015-2025 takes a firm stance regarding climate\nchange by advocating low carbon and climate-resilient development strategies to promote sustainable\ndevelopment. Guinea-Bissau reaffirms its commitment under the INDCs to reducing our greenhouse gas\nemissions through the expansion of national protected areas and a moratorium to ban the felling and export of\ntimber.\n\nThe findings of this Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change although preliminary, they reveal also an ecstatic landmark that the country has achieved by\nexpanding the size of protected areas from 15% to 26.34% (2017) of the country’s territory becoming a sanctuary\nfor the preservation of biodiversity and contributing towards emission reductions and sustainable development.\nHowever, this BUR has likewise exposed the priority areas in need of adaptation as well as the current gaps for an\neffective mitigation. It is clear that amongst other measures the country needs to put a strong emphasis on\nstrengthening human capacities that have a direct effect on improving decision making and planning for integral\nmanagement of low carbon development, by focusing on the necessary techniques and technologies -\nreforestation and conservation of forests and power generation systems from renewable energy (hydroelectric,\nphotovoltaic, wind).\n\nTherefore, Guinea-Bissau believes that with support of the International Community the attainment of these\nactions will contribute towards a greener economic growth trajectory for the country and simultaneously heighten\nthe county’s environmental safeguard for years ahead for the benefit of the people of Guinea-Bissau.\n\nHon. Quite Djata\nSecretary of State of Environment and Biodiversity\n\n i| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Acknowledgements\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau first and foremost, special\nthanks goes to the Global Environment Facility and the United Nations\nEnvironment for the financial support in the preparation and publication of\nthe of this Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update Report (BUR1) to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change of the Republic of\nGuinea-Bissau.\n\nThe development of this Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update Report to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was carried out\nunder the guidance and leadership of the Secretariat of State of Environment\nand Biodiversity - Directorate General of Environment to meet GuineaBissau’s obligation to prepare and submit Biennial Update Report to the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Introduction\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a non-Annex-I Party and a signatory to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol and as laid down in Art. 2, Paragraph 1\nof the Kyoto Protocol, is committed to engage and seek to achieve quantified emission limitations\nand reduction of GHG emissions in order to promote sustainable development, minimizing the\nsocial, environmental and economic impacts of anthropogenic activities that contribute to\nemissions of greenhouse gases and thus to global warming. In order to meet its reporting\nobligations, Guinea-Bissau has already prepared and submitted systematically: i) The First\nInventory and the Initial National Communication in 1996, the reference year 1994; ii) The Second\nInventory and subsequent Second National Communication in 2011, the base year 2000, the Third\nInventory and now the First Biennial Update Report and consequently, within this framework, the\nreporting guidelines, adopted during COP 8 for the preparation of National Communications\nfrom Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention and contained in decision 17/CP.8 have\nbeen adopted for the preparation of this Guinea Bissau First Biennial Update Report to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, In 2015 the country has been submitted the\nINDC serving as the basis for the Paris Agreement.\n\n6| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\n1.2 National Circumstances\nGuinea-Bissau, located in Western Africa (12° 00' N,\n15° 00' W), between Cape Roxo (latitude 12º 20' N),\nthe Cajete Ponta (latitude 10° 59' N) and the\nmeridians 13° 38' and 16° 43' W bordering the North\nAtlantic Ocean, with a surface area of 36,125 km2. It\nis bordered to the North with the Republic of\nSenegal and to the East and South with the Republic\nof Guinea and is bathed by the Atlantic Ocean to\nthe West. The country comprises a continental and\nan insular part ― the Bijagós archipelago,\nconsisting of 88 Islands and Islets of which only 21\nare inhabited. In addition to these islands, there are\nalso other islands separated from the continent only\nby narrow rias, such as Bolama, Komo, Melo, Peicixe\nand Geta. Guinea-Bissau is a country with a\nconsiderable natural capital. It has important water\n\nresources translated into 130 km3/year of surface\nwater and 445 km3/year of groundwater, a vast and\nrich maritime territory (54,000 km2 in 270 km of\ncoast), a biodiversity of a considerable level in West\nAfrica. Almost 10% of its territory is covered with\nMangal, perhaps the most important proportion of\nthe world. Currently approximately 26% of its land\nand sea territory is a sanctuary for the preservation\nof biodiversity. The Bijagós archipelago, an\nexceptional natural site with approximately 88\nislands and islanders, is a candidate for the\nUNESCO's\nMan\nand\nthe\nBiosphere\n(MAB)\nProgramme. Several other national localities (ponds\nof Cufada Natural Park, Wendus and other areas)\nare classified as RAMSAR sites (wetlands of\nInternational Importance).\n\nThe Bijagós archipelago, Poilão Island, home to one of the largest populations of nesting green turtles in the world.

Temperature\nprojection scenarios systematically signal increased\naverage daily temperatures of up to + 1.4°C for the\nperiod 2016-2045, potentially reaching up to +\n2.2°C in the 2046-2075 period, per a low emissions\nassumption. Under a high emission scenario, the\nchanges are in the order of + 1.6°C to + 3.1°C for\nthe period 2046 to 2075.\nThe monthly precipitation values (%) during the\nmonths of June, July, August and September of the\nmost recent time series (1981-2017) indicate that in\ngeneral there is a tendency for the values of\nmonthly precipitation to reduce (~10%) with great\ninterannual variability. Guinea-Bissau rainfall series\nindicates (Figure 1.2) that there have been three\nmain trends between 1950 and 2017: prevalence of\nwet years between 1950 and 1970: prevalence of dry\nyears between 1970 and 1990: and from 1990\nonwards: marked shifts between wet and dry year\n\n7| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\n1.2.2 Socio-Economy\nBetween 2005 and 2017, GuineaBissau’s HDI value\nincreased from 0.396 to 0.455, an increase of 15.0\npercent (Table 1.2). Guinea-Bissau’s life expectancy\nat birth increased by 8.7 years, mean years of\nschooling increased by 0.7 years and expected\nyears of schooling increased by 6.8 years (UNDP,\n2018). The vulnerability of the economy is twofold.\nIn one hand, the high dependence on agriculture\n(almost 60% of GDP) in particular, the cashew\nindustry alone, the main source of export revenue\nand a significant share of government revenue. On\nthe other hand, the long period of political\ninstability.\n\n1.2.4 Agriculture and Livestock\nThe agricultural sector is the backbone of GuineaBissau economy, a source of income for 85% of the\npopulation. Agriculture plays an important role in\nthe country's external accounts, and therefore has\na significant impact on macro-economic stability of\nGuinea-Bissau. Agricultural exports account for\nover 98% of total exports of goods. Production and\nexport of cashew nuts and rice cropping are the\nmajor activities coupled with extensive livestock. In\n2012, the area under cashew cultivation was 223\n000 ha with an annual production of 130 000 tons\nof raw cashew nuts (FAO, 2015)i.\n\n1.2.5 Energy and Water Resources\nEnergy consumption in Guinea-Bissau is mainly\nbased on biomass (90%), oil products (8%) and\nelectricity\n(2%).\nBiomass\nenergy\nresources\nencompasses wood, coal and agricultural / forest\nproducts. At the level of subsistence communities,\nthe collection and use of wood / coal for heating\nand cooking uses enormous resources in biomass\nand hand labour. The country’s water resource\nconsists\nof\nsurface\nwater,\nrainwater,\nand\ngroundwater. From the three categories of water\nresources the following quantities are estimated\n(DGRH, 2016): Surface water resources: 13,820\nmillion m3 (estimated); Rainwater resources: 45\nmillion m3; Groundwater resources: 1 756 million\nm3 of statistical reserves (estimated). These\nresources have an estimated renewable annual rate\nof 180 million m3. The surface water includes major\nrivers and its tributaries (the main ones being from\nNorth to South, Cacheu, the Mansoa, the Geba, the\nCorubal, the Catio, the Rio Grande de Buba, the\nCumbijã and Cacine) and estuaries\n1.2.6 Coastal Zone and Biodiversity\nBijagós Archipelago is one of the Guinea-Bissau’s\nprotected areas made of a collection of 88 islands\nthat guard the country’s capital Bissau. A UNESCO\nMan and Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO,2017). the\narchipelago contains both national protected areas\n(Orango, João Vieira-Poilão) and community\nreserves (Urok)ii all haven for hundreds of species of\nbirds, fish, and mammals. Poilão is amongst the 10\nmost important nesting sites for green turtle\npopulation (Figure 1.3) making one of the greatest\nbiodiversity values of Guinea-Bissau.\n\n1.2.7 Forests and Land Use\nGuinea-Bissau continues to have huge agricultural\nand forestry potential, including arable land\nestimated at about 1.5 million hectares, of which\n80% is on plateaus, 200,000 in freshwater valleys,\n106,000 in salt water valleys and more than 100,000\nsquare metres of areas with industrial wood\n(macauhub.com. 2018) The savannas dominate the\nland cover, accounting for about 45 percent of the\ncountry’s land surface in Guinea-Bissau. More than\n70 percent of the country is forested —more than\n45 percent of which is primary forest. The South of\nthe country consists essentially of clump forests\nwith some of the country's best-preserved forest\npatches, probably housing the most dense northern\nforest area in West Africa. The human pressure in\nsearch of spaces for agriculture, construction and\ncommercial purposes, and of woody material\n(firewood, coal) for the production of energy, etc.,\nhave led in particular to the degradation of the\nclump forests of the southern zone. Deforestation,\nthat is, the use of forest resources for other\npurposes, is responsible for issuing a large amount\nof CO2 by the atmosphere. The estimates point to\na decrease in the order of 625,000 m3 per year,\nfrom the forest surface of the country (The National\nStrategic document – Terra Ranka (2015-2025)), i.e.:\n― Reduction of 30% of the dense humid forests\nof Tombali;\n― Reduction of 57% of the savannah forests of\nBafatá, Oio and Gabú;\n― Reduction of 19% of Mangrove forests.\n\n1.2.8 Biodiversity and The National Protected\nAreas\nCompared to the neighbouring countries in the\nWest Africa the biodiversity of Guinea-Bissau is still\nrelatively rich, diversified and unique. This can be\n\n8| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\nseen from the data below of species count by taxa\nfor Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAnimal / plant group\nSpecies count\nBirds\n456\nAmphibians\n21\nReptiles\n69\nFishes\n677\nMammals\n123\nVascular plants\n1000\nSource: Amphibians - amphibiaweb; Reptiles - reptile-database;\nFish - fishbase; Birds - birdlife; Mammals - IUCN; and Plants -\nWorld Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP-WCMC).\n\nThere are however several factors of pressure on\nbiodiversity mostly originated by human activities.\nAmong others the (i) effects of extensive livestock\npracticed in the country, mainly in the east and\nnortheast zones, (ii) forest fires sometimes\nuncontrolled, which have negative impact on the\nfauna and floristic composition; (iii) the pressure of\nthe exponential growth of population with rapid\nurbanisation with corresponding needs, including\nthat of woody fuel (firewood and coal), (iv) the\npractice of the traditional agriculture based on slash\nand burn; the wild expansion of cashew orchards;\nthe growing production and firewood search and\nvegetable coal for domestic use as source of energy\n(v) wood exploitation leading to a frightening\ndegradation of the forest potential taking place\nparticularly in the east frontier zones, namely\nPirada, Canquelifá, Pitche and surroundings,\naccentuating climate change impacts (GoGB, 2015).\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau (GoGB) aware of\nthe current challenges of this sector has put forward\nan Action Plan for the Strategy for the Biodiversity\nof Guinea-Bissau with the objective to identify solid\nmeasures to accomplish its goals.\n\nA ploughshare tortoise listed as endangered. | Credit: Beth\nDevler/Getty\nThe creation of the Protected Areas for the\nconservation\nand\nmanagement\nof\nnatural\nresources, is one of the greatest achievements of\nthe country. The National System of Protected\nAreas of Guinea-Bissau corresponds to seven\nprotected areas (SEA. 2019): Parque Natural das\nLagoas da Cufada (PNLC), Parque Nacional de\nCantanhez (PNC), Complexo Dulombi, Boé e\nTchetche (DBT), Parque Nacional das Ilhas de\nOrango (PNO), Parque Natural dos Tarrafes de\nCacheu (PNTC), terrestrial part of Parque Nacional\nMarinho João Vieira e Poilão (PNMJVP) and Área\nMarinha Protegida Comunitária das Ilhas de Urok\n(AMPCIU). The national protected areas system\nnow covers 26.3% of the national territory, with an\nextension of approximately 750,000ha representing\n12.4% of marine protected areas and 13.9% of\nterrestrial protected areas, which is by and large\ncompliant with the Aichi Targets of the Convention\non Biological Diversity (CBD).\n\n1.3 National Greenhouse Gas\nInventory\nThe inventory carried out from 1978 to 1985 showed\nthat the forest space had decreased about 31,500\nha in this period being Afzelia africana, Khaya\nsenegalensis and Pterocarpus erinaceus the three\nspecies most sought. However more recent data\nindicate an alarming scenario on forest degradation\nin the country. Deforestation measured as tree\ncover loss assessed from 2001 to 2018 for different\n\"tree cover threshold\" used for defining the tree\ncover area from dense forests (≥75% close\ncanopies) to open forests (≥10% sparse canopies)\nindicate systematic losses across all threshold\nvalues. Forest degradation in open canopies are\nextremely high with more than 230,000 ha lost in\nthe open forests of Guinea-Bissau. Yearly average\nlosses varied from 6064 ha during the 2001-2010\nperiod to 21,176 ha between 2011 and 2018. Forest\ndegradation gradually decreases with increasing\ncover threshold (≥75% close canopies) reaching\n1,213 ha of tree cover within the 18 years period. The\nresults from these emissions calculations indicate\nthat the bulk of GHG emissions in the energy Sector,\nin the referential year of 2010, was concentrated in\nthe residential subsector and represented by\ncarbon dioxide emissions (94%). These results also\nsuggest a high consumption of firewood and\ncharcoal in households both in urban centres and\nin rural areas. Emissions are attributable to the\n\n9| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\ncombustion of fossil fuels, but also to the burning\nof plant biomass, i.e. firewood and charcoal. The\nAgriculture and Livestock subsector show positive\nemissions of methane (CH4) which contributed with\na total of 102.7 Gg CO2 equivalent in two\nsubcategories of Enteric fermentation and Manure\nManagement and 9.6. Gg CO2 equivalent for\nburning of biomass subcategory. This represented\na total of 112,3 Gg CO2.\nNotwithstanding the above expected rises in\nGHG emission, the Land Use, Land-Use Change\nand Forestry (LULUCF) is still the highest single\nsector acting as a net sink of GHG amounting to 10718 Gg for the year 2010. Therefore, GuineaBissau is and will remain as an absolute sink of\ngreenhouse gases, given the high potential for\nsequestration by the Forestry sub-sector and the\nFramework Law on sustainable development\npromoting the expansion of the national Protected\nAreas as well as the implementation of the country's\nbiodiversity protection policy.\n\n1.4 Mitigation Actions\nGuinea-Bissau's main national bodies relevant to\nthe climate change mitigation legal framework are:\n1. The National Authority designated for the Kyoto\nMechanisms (DNA that deals with the approval and\nmonitoring of the implementation of projects under\nthe Clean development Mechanism and REDD\nframework.\n2. The National Committee on Climate Change\n(NCCC) supervised by The Secretariat of State of\nEnvironment and Biodiversity (SEAB) consists of an\nadvisory board, a Scientific Council and a technical\ncommittee.\nThe Guinea-Bissau’s emission pattern is such that\nLand Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)\nis still the highest single sector acting as a net sink\nof GHG in 2010. By contrast, GHG emissions from oil\nproducts and transport are significant in the Energy\nSector and so does the GHG emissions from land\ncultivation and livestock in the Agriculture and\nLivestock sectors. Deforestation is also responsible\nfor the release of large amounts of CO2 by\nloosening up carbon stored in forest soils,\nincreasing the chances it will return to the\natmosphere as carbon dioxide and by reducing the\ncarbon sequestration capacity of the country.\nThe\nGuinea-Bissau\nmitigation\nstrategy\nencompasses the implementation of unconditional\nactions and policies complemented by other\nconditional measures supported mainly by bilateral\nor international funding. Since the mitigation\nactions available, such as natural regeneration,\nshort-spin forestry and bioenergy for replacing\nfossil fuels, are not currently practicable mitigation\noptions, the Government of Guinea-Bissau has\ncapitalized efforts to Mitigation in the action of\nforest protection mitigation with a focus on the\nestablishment and effective management of\nprotected areas (APs). Additionally, with the\nimplementation of the LEAP SCREENING program\nbased on the above-mentioned scenarios, the\nfollowing GHG mitigation options have been\nselected in the energy sector:\n• The mitigation scenario by replacing traditional\nstoves of three stones or charcoal stoves, for gas\nstoves. In this option the country would avoid the\nissuance of 163,038 TE CO2 at a sale price of $5.2/\nton of carbon; The mitigation scenario, through the\nconstruction of the dams of Saltinho and Cussilintra\n(the country would divert the emission of 1,130,338\nTE CO2 at a sale price of $7.78/ ton of carbon);\n• The scenario of mitigating the decentralisation of\nrural electrification by using a photovoltaic system\n(the country could protect itself against the\nemission of 47,312 TE CO2 at a sale price of US\n$6.24/ ton of carbon);\nThe mitigation scenario that encompasses the\ninterconnection\nof\nthe\nelectricity\ngrid\nand\nSambagalou and Kaleta (the country would avoid\nthe issuance of 645,170 TE CO2 to $126.72/ ton of\ncarbon sales price).\nThe mitigation scenario based on the development\nand establishment of a legal framework through a\nnational strategy for the development of low\ncarbon in the long term.\n\n1.5 Financial, Technology, Capacity\nNeeds and Support Received for\nClimate Change Activities\nIn the current economic, social and environmental\nsituation of the country, identifying constraints and\nthe financial, technical gaps, and capacity-building\nneeds required for the preparation of BUR 1 is a\nchallenging exercise. However, some country needs\nfor financial, technical and technological support\nand capacity building were identified in order to be\nable to address gaps in handling climate change\nissues. Thus, financial support is required for:\n• Strengthen the financial capacity of the state and\nof the research institutions to collect, archive and\n\n10| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Executive Summary\nanalyse climate data and renewable natural\nresources;\n• Allocate financial resources for the purchase and\nacquisition of certain data and software essential for\nvulnerability\nassessment\nand\nformulation\nof\nadaptation strategy;\n• Provide the country with financial resources to\nbuild capacity and set up a regular vulnerability\nassessment system and climate change adaptation\nand mitigation programs and strategies, among\nothers. According to the Guinea-Bissau Sustainable\nEnergy Investment Plan 2015-2030, approximately\n€680,458,000 would be required in the Energy\nsector, of which €630,000,000 would be invested in\nrenewable\nenergy;\n€3,103,000\nin\nBioenergy;\n€36,000,000 in Energy Efficiency and €11,355,000 in\nFavourable\nEnvironment\n(Institutional\nand\nregulatory capacity building).\nAlternatively, the country should strengthen its\ncapacity at national and local levels to plan and\nimplement measures to increase the resilience of its\ncommunities, equipment and ecosystems to\nclimate change. At local level, communities should\nidentify and prioritize measures and undertake\nprograms and projects that incorporate capital\ngains into their livelihoods; activities that reduce\ntheir vulnerability, in particular as regards climate\nchange and climate variability.\n\n1.6 Information on domestic MRV of\nDomestically supported NAMAs\nReporting and verification are important for\nensuring\ntransparency,\ngood\ngovernance,\naccountability, and credibility of results, and for\nbuilding confidence that resources are being\nutilized effectively. The National Objective is to set\nup a Measurement, Reporting, and Verification\n(MRV)\nsystem\nintegrated\ninto\nthe\ncurrent\nMonitoring and Evaluation (M&E) process at\nnational, sectoral and probably district level\nwhenever possible.\n\nThe National Appropriate Mitigation Actions\n(NAMAs) concept is still in the evolution phase and\ncan be implemented differently depending on the\ntype of support expected by developing countries.\nNAMAs promise to become a primary mechanism\nfor\nachieving\n\"common\nbut\ndifferentiated\nresponsibilities\" in the fight against climate change.\nGuinea Bissau has developed legal and institutional\narrangements for the implementation of NAMAS.\nThe National Designated Authority for Kyoto\nMechanisms (AND-GB) was established by Decree\nNo. 11/2006 of the Council of Ministers. Since then\nseveral initiatives were undertaken not exactly as\nNAMAs but in the context of Low Emissions and\nDevelopment Strategies - LEDS initiatives.\nLow Emissions and Development Strategies - LEDS\ninitiatives provides a direct link between mitigation\nand achieving sustainable development, while\nclimate change is a cross-cutting issue across all the\nsustainable development goals (SDGs) particularly\nthe SDG 13 (climate action). , Guinea Bissau has\nreceived a number of international aid over time,\nsome of which are of assistance to the sectors\ninvolved in fight against the impacts of climate\nchange.\n\n1.7 Additional Information\nThe PRSP II proposal TERRA RANKA Strategic\nDocument 2015-2025 takes a firm stance with\nregard\nto\nclimate\nchange\nby\npromoting\nDevelopment strategies for different growth sectors\nshould become low carbon and climate-resilient\ndevelopment strategies to promote sustainable\ndevelopment. In this context the Biodiversity and\nNatural Capital axis aims to preserve and value the\ncountry's natural resources in a sustainable way.\nMitigation measures are contemplated by the\nproposed increase in the percentage of protected\nareas from 15 to 26%, according to the National\nProtected Areas Strategy enhancing the capacity of\ncarbon sinks; and the programmed investments for\nthe power system to increase its installed capacity\nby 60%. Furthermore, Guinea-Bissau is currently\nseeking funding to draw up its NAMA Strategy and\nREDD + Strategy.\nIn terms of adaptation to climate change impacts\nthe National Strategic Plan prioritises the sectors\nwith the highest exposure: agriculture with 57%,\nfollowed by livestock and health both with 54%, and\nthe fisheries with 51% and infrastructure with 46%.\nIt also focusses on most vulnerable groups (54%),\nfollowed by livestock farmers (49%), waged workers\nliving in large cities (46%) and fishermen (34%).\n\n 11 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nhttps://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/144000/144858/iss058e010724 lrg.jpg\n\n 12 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nChapter 1:\nNational Circumstances\n\nChapter 1\nNational Circumstances\n\n1.1 Introduction .......................................................................................... 13\n1.2 Geography and Climate profile .................................................................. 14\n1.3 Population, Economic and Social Development ............................................... 16\n1.4 Sectoral Development .............................................................................. 17\n1.5 Water Resources, Land Use and Forest ........................................................... 19\n1.6 Key development policies relevant to climate change ....................................... 23\n1.7 References and Footnotes ......................................................................... 27\n\n 13 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nChapter 1:\nNational Circumstances\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nGuinea-Bissau, located in Western Africa (12° 00' N, 15° 00' W), between Cape Roxo (latitude 12º 20' N),\nthe Cajete Ponta (latitude 10° 59' N) and the meridians 13° 38' and 16° 43' W bordering the North Atlantic\nOcean, with a surface area of 36,125 km2. It is bordered to the North with the Republic of Senegal and to\nthe East and South with the Republic of Guinea and is bathed by the Atlantic Ocean to the West. The\ncountry comprises a continental and an insular part ― the Bijagós archipelago, consisting of 88 Islands\nand Islets of which only 21 are inhabited. In addition to these islands, there are also other islands separated\nfrom the continent only by narrow rias, such as Bolama, Komo, Melo, Peicixe and Geta. (Figure 1.1)\nTeak tree (Tectona Grandis) – Bissau – Guinea Bissau\nPhoto credit: T C Ferreira, 2015\n\n 14 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nFigure 1.1 - Geographic Location of Guinea-Bissau\nincluding the Bijagós archipelago\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a country with a considerable\nnatural capital. It has important water resources\ntranslated into 130 km3/year of surface water and\n445 km3/year of groundwater, a vast and rich\nmaritime territory (54,000 km2 in 270 km of coast),\nand a considerable biodiversity at level of West\nAfrica.\nAlmost 10% of its territory is covered with Mangal,\nperhaps the most important proportion of the\nworld. Currently approximately 26% of its land and\nsea territory is a sanctuary for the preservation of\nbiodiversity.\nThe\nBijagós\narchipelago,\nan\nexceptional natural site with approximately 88\nislands and islanders, is a candidate for the\nUNESCO's\nMan\nand\nthe\nBiosphere\n(MAB)\nProgramme. Several other national localities (ponds\nof Cufada Natural Park, Wendus and other areas)\nare classified as RAMSAR sites (wetlands of\nInternational Importance).\n\nThis Chapter presents the national circumstances of\nGuinea-Bissau, also includes information on\nfeatures of its geography, demography, climate and\neconomy as well as key features of the main\neconomic sectors (Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry,\nWater Resources, Public Health, Energy and Waste)\nto provide a sense of the overall national context in\nwhich climate change mitigation and adaptation\nchallenges are being dealt with.\n1.2 Geography and Climate profile\nThe climate of Guinea-Bissau is predominantly determined by factors such as the influence of the\ngeographic location of Guinea-Bissau, the anticyclone of the Azores, the neighboring Sahelian climatic\nzone; the trade winds; the \"Harmattan\"; the action of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated\nwith the African summer monsoon; the action of the oceanic currents, namely the continuity with the High\nAtlas chain of the Canary Islands (current of the North + current of Morocco + current of the Azores) and\nthe influence of the cold current during the northern winter that diverges to NW in the Atlantic region\nneighboring Guinea Bissau and lastly, the influence of the warm Contra-current (guinea current) during\nthe northern summer.\n\n1.2.1 Rainfall\nGuinea-Bissau has two very pronounced seasons:\nthe hot and rainy season, which lasts from May to\nNovember, and the hot and dry season from\nNovember to April. On average, about 80% of\nannual rainfall occurs during the months of July,\nAugust and September Precipitations during\nmonsoon stations can be intense, with more than\n500 mm/month recorded in August, which\nrepresents\nthe\nmedian\nof\na\nquasi-normal\ndistribution with values close to 400 mm/month in\nJuly and September. The smallest amount, close to\nzero (0.1 mm), occurs during the months of\nDecember to April (dry season). The climate in\ngeneral is tropical maritime with an average\ntemperature of 27 º C and Monsoon conditions\n(May to November) and the Winds \"Harmattan\"\n(hot dry air, and laden with dust from the Sahara)\nduring the dry season (November to April). These\nclimatic\ncharacteristics\ninduce\nvariations\nin\nprecipitation in relation to the geographic location\nof the country (South: > 1800 mm/year; West: 15501800 mm/year; Northwest: 1300-1550 mm/year;\nNorth-northeast: ≤ 1300 mm/year) and Southeast:\n1300-1550 mm/year.\n\n1.2.2 Temperature\nUnlike precipitation the temperature in GuineaBissau is subject to minor variations although the\naverage monthly temperature varies regularly\nthroughout the year, with maximum values\n\n 15 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nbetween April (28.5 º C) and May (28.7 º C) and\nminimum values between December and January\n(25.4 º C). Interestingly, unlike the past situation, the\nmonthly thermal amplitude is now considerably\nreduced during the particular rainy months\nbetween July and September when the minimum\ntemperature reaches 23 º C and maximum\ntemperature reaches minimum annual values (30.4\nº C-29.8 º C) in July and August respectively with\naverage monthly temperature varying between 24\nº C and 30 º C. Over a year, the daily temperature\ntypically varies from 18 º C to 35 ºC and is rarely less\nthan 17 º C or above 37 ºC. Spatially, the average\n(1981-2017) monthly values of the air temperature\nrange from 29.7 ºC to 39.4 ºC (maximum) and from\n16.3 ºC to 23.8 ºC (minimum) among the main\nregions of North, South and East central regions.\nSpatially and in terms of homogeneity the thermal\nregime divides the country by means in two distinct\nzones with average temperature values above 27.5\nº C to the east towards the interior in the Bafatá\nzone and below this value to the West and south\ntowards the coast in the area of Bissau and Bolama.\n\nTemperature series (1950-2001) indicate that there\nhas been an increase in the average temperature\nvalues at a rate of 0.0155 °c/year in the last 50 years,\nleading to an approximate average rate of variation\n(°c/century) of 1.55 °c. Thus, this temperature\nbehaviour\nreflects\nthe\nregional\npattern\nof\ntemperature variation in recent decades, which\nindicates that temperatures are increasing faster\nthan the global average. This increase ranged\nbetween 0.2 and 0.8 ° C since the end of the decade\nof 1970.\n\n1.2.3 Climate variability in Guinea-Bissau\nThroughout the year, the climate of Guinea-Bissau\nis mainly conditioned by the situation, movements\nand impacts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone\n(ZCIT or ITCZ of the English acronym) in relation to\nthe territory and the subsidiary actions of the semipermanent cells of high Pressure, commonly known\nas anticyclone of the Azores in the North Atlantic\nand anticyclone of Santa Helena in the South\nAtlantic, and also by the low summer thermal that\nsettles on the Sahara Desert. Changes in the\nbehaviour of the general air circulation systems\nsuch as the abnormal oscillation of the ITCZ or the\nincrease of the sea surface temperature (SSTs) that\ntakes place when there is a cool in the northern\ntropical Atlantic, and a little warm up in the South\nAtlantic, the region of the Sahel where Guinea\nBissau tends to become drier with decreased\nprecipitation.\nOn\nthe\nother\nhand,\nhuman\nanthropogenic action by reducing vegetation\ncover, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and\nair pollution in the northern hemisphere has also\nbeen pointed out as being at the origin of climate\nchange in the Sahel region and surrounding area\nsuch as Guinea-Bissau. These changes are\nparticularly notable in the variability of precipitation\nwith delays in early rains, increased extreme events\nof precipitation, reduction of total and the number\nof days of precipitation, appearance of dry periods\nat half of rainfall season, strong winds, increased\ntemperature, increased heat waves, decreased\nthermal amplitude with rise of the minimum\ntemperature and number of warm nights (with\nvalues oscillating in about 10% in some cases).\n\n1.2.4 Temperature variability\nClimate unpredictability will remain an overriding\naspect of climate in Guinea-Bissau. Given that these\nqualms are present in the socio-economic life of the\ncountry, planning for increases in temperature\ntogether with the development of resilient planning\nfor extreme events of drought will be required,\nparticularly in the eastern portion of the country\n(Bafatá), and flood along the coastal zone and\nuncertainty over precipitation levels. Temperature\nprojection scenarios systematically signal increased\naverage daily temperatures of up to + 1.4°C for the\nperiod 2016-2045, potentially reaching up to +\n2.2°C in the 2046-2075 period, per a low emissions\nassumption. Under a high emission scenario, the\nchanges are in the order of + 1.6°C to + 3.1°C for\nthe period 2046 to 2075.\n\n1.2.5 Rainfall variability\nThe monthly precipitation values (%) during the\nmonths of June, July, August and September of the\nmost recent time series (1981-2017) indicate that in\ngeneral there is a tendency for the values of\nmonthly precipitation to reduce (~10%) with great\ninterannual variability. Guinea-Bissau rainfall series\nindicates (Figure 1.2) that there have been three\nmain trends between 1950 and 2017: prevalence of\nwet years then between 1950 and 1970: prevalence\nof dry years between 1970 and 1990: and from 1990\nonwards: marked shifts between wet and dry years.\n\n 16 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nFigure 1.2 - Change in rainfall index (SPI) for Guinea-Bissau between 1950 to 2017 (Data Source: Ferreira, T C & Lona, J\nT. 2018 with data from INM-GB, 2018).\n\n1.3 Population, Economic and Social Development\nGuinea Bissau's population is estimated to climb to 1.92 million in 2019, compared to 1,842 million (est\n2017) and 1,514 million at the 2014 census. The population density of Guinea Bissau increased from 44.21\npeople per square kilometer as of, 2000 to 64,57 in 2016 (Table 1.1). Concentration of urban population is\nalso taking place in other major cities such as Gabú 43,556 (2009) and Bafatá 34,760 (2010). Population of\nurban areas in Guinea-Bissau has been growing at considerable rate and recent data indicate that\nurbanization stands at 4.28% (2010-2016 est.). This means that in general considerable amount of people\nis migrating to urban areas. Urban population (% of total) in Guinea Bissau stand at 43.4 % in 2018 est\n(World Fact Book, 2018). Approximately one-fifth of the population lives in the capital city of Bissau along\nthe Atlantic coast; the remainder is distributed among the eight other, mainly rural, regions. The population\nof Guinea-Bissau is expected to grow in 2019 and reach 2,000,000 by the end of 2020 (populationof.net.\n2019).\n\nTable 1.1 - Guinea-Bissau’s population and demographic trends based on consistent time series data (sources: GNB\nBUR Sectoral Report 2018 with data from INE, 2009; WB, 2016).\n\nIndicator\n2000\n2010\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\nTotal population1\n1.243\n1.555\n1.638\n1.681\n1.725\n1.770\n1.815\n1.842*\nAnnual population growth (%)\n1,82\n2,50\n2,60\n2,61\n2,60\n2,56\n2,52\n-\nAnnual growth urban population (%)\n4,09\n4,46\n4,41\n4,35\n4,27\n4,16\n4,05\n-\nAnnual growth of pop-rural (%)\n0,53\n0,91\n1,02\n1,05\n1,05\n1,03\n1,00\n-\nPopulation density (inhab/km2)\n44,21\n55,33\n58,26\n59,80\n61,37\n62,96\n64,57\n-\nBirth rate (Gross/1000 inhab.)\n41,33\n39,25\n38,58\n38,15\n37,68\n37,15\n-\n-\nMortality rate (Gross/1000 inhab.)\n14,04\n11,99\n11,52\n11,27\n11,03\n10,78\n-\n-\nAverage life expectancy (years)\n52,23\n55,00\n55,76\n56,15\n56,55\n56,95\n-\n-\nInfant mortality rate (/1000 birt.)\n105,20\n72,40\n66,50\n63,90\n61,60\n59,60\n57,80\n-\n\n1 In 2009, the population was 1.520.830, According to the official census (INEC, RGPH, 2009)\n\n 17 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\n1.3.1 Demography\nIn 2015 the population age distribution was such\nthat 39.6% of the population is under 15 years old,\n55.0% between 15 and 60 years old and 5.4% of the\npopulation is 65+. Guinea-Bissau’s young and\ngrowing population is sustained by high fertility;\napproximately 60% of the population is under the\nage of 25. Its large reproductive-age population\nand total fertility rate of more than 4 children per\nwoman offsets the country’s high infant and\nmaternal mortality rates. The latter is among the\nworld’s highest because of the prevalence of early\nchildbearing, a lack of birth spacing, the high\npercentage of births outside of health care facilities,\nand a shortage of medicines and supplies.\nPredominantly, the population of Guinea-Bissau is\nrural based, with about 56.6 percent of GuineaBissau's population living in rural areas and the\nnumber of urban residents being around 743 402.\n\n1.3.2 Socio-Economy\nGuinea-Bissau’s HDI value for 2017 is 0.455— which\nput the country in the low human development\ncategory—positioning it at 177 out of 189 countries\nand\nterritories.\nBetween\n2005\nand\n2017,\nGuineaBissau’s HDI value increased from 0.396 to\n0.455, an increase of 15.0 percent (Table 1.2).\nGuinea-Bissau’s life expectancy at birth increased\nby 8.7 years, mean years of schooling increased by\n0.7 years and expected years of schooling increased\nby 6.8 years (UNDP, 2018).\nStandard of living measured by Gross National\nIncome (GNI) per capita expressed in constant 2011\ninternational dollars converted using purchasing\npower parity (PPP) conversion rates have shown a\nsteady increase from 1,335 in 1990 to 1,552 in 2017\n(UNDP, 2018). However, the GDP per-capita of\nGuinea-Bissau\nas an indicator of country's\neconomic strength, has reached 692.60 US dollars\nin 2011 and went through a mostly stable period\npicking up to 614 in 2010 then reaching 620.21 US\ndollars in 2016 and this represents a GDP per Capita\nequivalent to 3% of the world's average.\nThe vulnerability of the economy is twofold. In one\nhand, the high dependence on agriculture (almost\n60% of GDP) in particular, the cashew industry\nalone, the main source of export revenue and a\nsignificant share of government revenue. On the\nother hand, the long period of political instability.\n\nTable 1.2 -.

Agriculture plays an important role in the country's external accounts, and therefore has a\nsignificant impact on macro-economic stability of Guinea-Bissau. Agricultural exports account for over 98%\nof total exports of goods. Production and export of cashew nuts and rice cropping are the major activities\ncoupled with extensive livestock. In 2012, the area under cashew cultivation was 223 000 ha with an annual\nproduction of 130 000 tons of raw cashew nuts (FAO, 2015)3. In 2013, cashew nuts accounted for 87.7\npercent of the country’s total exports. The industry has been increasing since the late 1990s, and now 85\npercent of people living in rural areas depend on these orchards in some way for their livelihoods4. This\nhas allowed for great economic improvement, yet the lack of biodiversity involved with this monocultural\npractice leaves citizens extremely vulnerable. If crops failed or were struck by disease, hundreds of\nthousands of citizens would be negatively affected.\n\n 18 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report – Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nThe country’s climate and soil make it feasible to\ngrow a wide range of cash crops, fruit, vegetables,\nand tubers; however, cashews generate on average\nmore than 80% of export receipts and are the main\nsource of income for many rural communities.\nGuinea-Bissau also exports to Asia non-fillet frozen\nfish and seafood, peanuts, palm kernels, and timber\n(The World Fact Book, 2019). License fees for fishing\nin their sea-zone (Gulf of Guinea) provide the\ngovernment with some revenue. Rice is the major\ncrop and staple food. Commercial cashew nut\ngrowers have 15% of cashew plantations (15 000\nhectares) whilst the remaining 85% (88 000\nhectares) belong to traditional farmers. Rice is\nanother strategic crop in Guinea-Bissau and is the\nstaple food of more than 95 percent of the\npopulation. In 2014, the country produced 133 000\ntonnes of this cereal. However, for over ten years,\nthere has been a growing deficit, which was\nestimated at over 100 000 tons in 2009/2010, with\ndomestic production covering only 47% of\nconsumption. In Guinea-Bissau, the livestock sector\ncontributes 17% to the national GDP and 32% of the\nagrarian sector GDP. According to the livestock\ncensus conducted in 2009 by the Directorate\nGeneral of Livestock (DGP) under the PRESAR / BAD,\nit is estimated that the total number of cattle rounds\n1 325 412, distributed mainly in eastern and northern\nareas5.\n\nN'Dama cattle breed\n\n1.4.2 Fishing\nThe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) runs along 270\nkm of coastline and has 105.740 square kilometres\nfor a continental shelf of 45 000 km². The fisheries\nsector is one of the most important for the country’s\n\n2 Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du fleuve Gambie\neconomy and directly employs around 15 000\npeople or indirectly 120 000 workers. Fishing\ncontributes to about 7-10% to GDP and around\n3.9% in exports contributing with 40% to the state\nbudget (The World Bank, 2018). Fishing in GuineaBissau has a potential estimated at around 523 160\ntons, corresponding to a pelagic potential of\naround 212 500 tons and demersal (bottom\ndwelling) species equal to 310 660 tons. Artisan\nfishery accounts to about 35 000 t (2010). Artisan\nfishery\nhas\nincorporated\nsome\ntechnical\ninnovations, such as certain kinds of nets, new\nrefrigeration techniques and, mostly, motorization\nwith the introduction of outboard motors. This\nfishery is done in a complex, fragile and mobile\nmarine ecosystem (Nahada, et al., 2012).\n\n1.4.3 Energy\nEnergy consumption in Guinea-Bissau is mainly\nbased on biomass (90%), oil products (8%) and\nelectricity\n(2%).\nBiomass\nenergy\nresources\nencompass wood, coal and agricultural / forest\nproducts. At the level of subsistence communities,\nthe collection and use of wood / coal for heating\nand cooking uses enormous resources in biomass\nand hand labour. The hydroelectric potential of\nGuinea Bissau is high, however only 33.84MW of\nhydropower capacity has been identified so far\n(including Saltinho (14MW) and Cusselinta (13MW))\nin studies carried out in the 1980’s. Therefore, in\nGuinea-Bissau the production of electricity is\nexcessively dependent on imported diesel fuel. The\ncountry’s energy strategy pursues to increase\nreliance on local energy sources, by placing more\nemphasis on the utilization of renewable energies\nto gradually lessen the dependency on the\ntraditional\nenergy\nsources,\nespecially\noil\nimportation. Guinea Bissau has only one solar\nphotovoltaic power plant of 314kW to produce\nelectricity (which was expected to start operating in\n2014), and a pilot projects for energy cogeneration\nwith cashew shells, whose energy sources or\nresources are abundant in the country. In addition,\nthere are projects being developed in the context\nof hydroelectric plants, for example, the OMVG2,\n(the\nGambia\nRiver\nBasin\nDevelopment\nOrganization) Saltinho/Cusselinta and Banbadinga.\n\n 19 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\n1.4.4 Coastal Zones and Biodiversity\nGuinea Bissau’s biodiversity constitutes a significant natural asset for the country that, if protected, has the\npotential to serve as the backbone of a future tourism industry. Possessing an incredibly diverse set of ecosystems ranging from dense tropical forests to mangrove swamps, Guinea-Bissau has become increasingly\nmore conscious of the value of its natural wealth, investing substantially in conservation to the extent that\napproximately 26% of its national territory is protected (The World Bank, 2015).\n\nGuinea-Bissau’s Bijagós Archipelago is one of these\nprotected areas made of a collection of 88 islands\nthat guard the country’s capital Bissau. A UNESCO\nMan and Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO, 2017). the\narchipelago contains both national protected areas\n(Orango, João Vieira-Poilão) and community\nreserves (Urok)6 all haven for hundreds of species\nof birds, fish, and mammals. Poilão is amongst the\n10 most important nesting sites for green turtle\npopulation (Figure 1.3) making one of the greatest\nbiodiversity values of Guinea-Bissau. At the same\ntime, the coastal zone also provides valuable\necosystem services now, including nursery and\nbreeding grounds for commercial fish stocks,\ncarbon stocks and a buffer to mitigate against the\nimpacts of climate change. Two additional\nterrestrial national parks (the Dulombi and Boé\nparks) and three environmental corridors (the TcheTche, Salifo, and Cantabane Corridors), which\nconnect areas and permit wildlife movement while\nbuffering human communities, were recentlt\nadded. At present, vegetative cover along the\ncoastline in the identified hotspots has been\ndegraded for several climate and anthropogenicdriven reasons. In Guinea Bissau mangroves are\nexploited to smoke fish and have reduced\nmangrove cover that otherwise function as a\nnatural protective barrier to coastline erosion and\nsustain fishing activity.\nGreen Turtle\nFigure 1.3 - Green turtle in Poilão protected area - GuineaBissau’s Bijagós Archipelago (Seminoff, J.A. 2004)\n\n1.5 Water Resources, Land Use and Forest\n1.5.1 Rivers\nThe country’s water resource consists of surface\nwater, rainwater, and groundwater. From the three\ncategories of water resources the following\nquantities are estimated (DGRH, 2016): Surface\nwater resources: 13,820 million m3 (estimated);\nRainwater resources: 45 million m3; Groundwater\nresources: 1 756 million m3 calculated reserves\n(estimated). These resources have an estimated\nrenewable annual rate of 180 million m3. The\nsurface water includes major rivers and its\ntributaries (the main ones being from North to\nSouth, Cacheu, the Mansoa, the Geba, the Corubal,\nthe Catio, the Rio Grande de Buba, the Cumbijã and\nCacine) and estuaries. In addition, there are\nimportant stationary water bodies including lakes\n(like Cufada pond with an area of 35 000 hectares),\n\nlowlands (bas-fonds) and often temporary water\nbodies (Vendus) a common structure found in the\nEast of the country. Some of the important rivers\nhave a highly seasonal flow and many streams and\nrivers can dry up during the latter part of the\nsummer. The Geba, the Farim and the Corubal\nRivers are the most important in the country, and\nthe first two almost cease to flow in the dry season.\nThe Corubal River has an important dry season flow\n(11 m³/ s on average) becoming the most important\nsurface water resource in the country. The Geba\nRiver contribution is more modest, but with\ndramatic reduction of the flow of some of its\ntributaries during the dry season. Water Resources\nof main water Basins in Guinea-Bissau including the\naverage annual volume is shown in Table 1.3.\n\n 20 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nTable 1.3 - Water Resources of Main Water Basins (DGRH, 2016).\n\nWater Basin\nStation\nSurface\nArea\n(Km2)\nAverage\nAnnual\nVolume\n(Mm3/Ano)\nDry Year Volume\nRecurrence 5 Years (Mm3/Year)\nAnnual Volume\nDecadal\n(Mm3/Year)\nCorubal\nSaltinho\n23 840\n13 200\n8 100\n6 380\nGeba\nBafata\n10 325\n820\n-\n375\nGeba\nGambiel\n590\n58\n-\n-\nCacheu\nJumbembem\n1 722\n96\n-\n34\nCatio\nBalana\n150\n90\n-\n-\n\n1.5.2 Groundwater\nThe renewal of the water resources depends largely on\nthe intensity and regularity of rainfall, whose parameters\nhave been worsening gradually over the years.\nGroundwater and surface water reserves (free aquifers)\nare estimated to be several hundred m³ / year (from 10\nto 250 m³ / year, depending on the zone). However,\nwith high rates exploitation and salinity problems while\nmuch of the river network is actually an estuary with\ntides there is a significant saltwater intrusion extending\n175 km upriver within the territory. This causes\nsignificant saltwater intrusion into the aquifer, which can\ncause problems during the dry season, if the extraction\nexceeds the water filling the aquifer. There is a huge\nwater potential in the regions of Biombo and Cacheu\nOio. However, cases of pollution of aquifers by\nsaltwater, are most common in these regions. Deep\naquifers, though little known in the South, have more\nlimited exploitable renewable resources in the order of\n10 to 30 Mm³ / year. The current exploitation of aquifers\nis estimated at 15 Mm³ / year and only 14% of deep\naquifers are exploited in the region (DGRH, 2012).\n\n1.5.3 Land Use\nGuinea-Bissau continues to have huge agricultural and\nforestry potential, including arable land estimated at\nabout 1.5 million hectares, of which 80% is on plateaus,\n200,000 in freshwater valleys, 106,000 in salt water\nvalleys and more than 100,000 square metres of areas\nwith industrial wood (macauhub.com. 2018)\n The\nsavannas dominate the land cover, accounting for about\n45 percent of the country’s land surface in GuineaBissau. Although the total savanna land surface has\nremained nearly unchanged, the underlying dynamic is\nnot so simple. The rate of deforestation has increased\nfrom about 2 percent per year between 1975 and 2000\nto 3.9 percent over the 2000 to 2013 period. Overall,\nGuinea-Bissau lost about 77 percent of its forests\nbetween 1975 and 2013; only 180 sq km remain, mainly\nin the south near the Guinea border. Likewise,\nwoodlands regresed by 35 percent over the 38 years, a\nloss of 1,750 sq km (eros.usgs.gov. 2013).\n\n1.5.4 Forests\nMore than 70 percent of the country is forested —more\nthan 45 percent of which is primary forest. The south of\nthe country consists essentially of clump forests with\nsome of the country's best-preserved forest patches,\nprobably housing the most dense northern forested\narea in West Africa. The forests of Guinea-Bissau\ncontribute 6% in national GDP and contribute 6.2% in\nthe country's export revenues. While Guinea-Bissau's\nnet deforestation rate has been relatively low at 0.5\npercent per year between 2000 and 2005, there is\nconcern about increasing growth and development,\nespecially in a new era of relative political stability. In\nparticular, coastal mangrove swamps—some of the\nmost important in Africa—are giving way to rice fields\nand hydroelectric projects. Slash-and-burn agriculture,\ncoal production, fires, fuelwood cutting, and logging for\ntimber have resulted in forest loss and subjected\nGuinea-Bissau to serious soil degradation. Actually, new\ndata (Mongabay, 2018) shows that the area of tree cover\n(1,022,708 ha) in 2018 in relation to land area (3,402,910\nha) stands at 30.1% (Mongabay, 2018). Annual loss (ha)\nof primary forest cover and tree cover for Guinea-Bissau\nis rapidily changing as is shown in Table 1.4. The human\npressure in search of spaces for agriculture, construction\nand commercial purposes, and of woody material\n(firewood, coal) for the production of energy, etc., have\nled in particular to the degradation of the clump forests\nof the southern zone.\nTable 1.4 - Annual loss (ha) of primary forest cover and tree\ncover for Guinea-Bissau by year from 2000 to 2018.\nYear\nPrimary forest\nTree cover (30%7)\n2001\n\n2,368\n2002\n137\n6,081\n2003\n14\n1,022\n\n 21 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\n2004\n76\n3,550\n2005\n76\n3,550\n2006\n49\n2,019\n2007\n65\n6,054\n2008\n69\n3,255\n2009\n138\n7,975\n2010\n139\n4,909\n2011\n149\n4,284\n2012\n110\n3,517\n2013\n476\n20,735\n2014\n448\n12,885\n2015\n408\n12,693\n2016\n527\n16,140\n2017\n504\n16,465\n2018\n451\n14,412\nSource:https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Guin\nea-Bissau.htm\n\nDeforestation, that is, the use of forest resources for\nother purposes, is responsible for issuing a large\namount of CO2 by the atmosphere. The estimates point\nto a decrease in the order of 625,000 m3 per year, from\nthe forest surface of the country (The National Strategic\ndocument – Terra Ranka (2015-2025)), i.e.:\n― Reduction of 30% of the dense humid forests of\nTombali;\n― Reduction of 57% of the savannah forests of Bafatá,\nOio and Gabú;\n― Reduction of 19% of Mangrove forests.\nThe forest area of Guinea-Bissu is around 2 072 000 ha\n(CARBOVEG Project, 2007). However, between 60,000\nand 80,000 hectares (Sardinha, 1993) of Guinea-Bissau\nforest are lost every year due to deforestation, illegal\nlogging, uncontrolled forest fires and charcoal\nproduction. The wood is the dominant biomass fuel for\ndomestic consumption, with a demand that probably\nexceeds 500 000 tonnes per year. The vast majority of\nthe population still cooks on firewood and charcoal and\non average, 60 000 hectares (Bianchi et. al., in 1986) of\nland are cleared and/or burned every year in GuineaBissau. The disappearance of the forest and mangroves,\nand the impact on sequestration of the GHGs produced\nthrough fires and smoke form charcoal and wood as\nhousehold energy may probably lead to serious\natmospheric consequences.\n\n1.5.5 Conservation and Management of\nBiodiversity\nCompared to the neighboring countries in the West\nAfrica the biodiversity of Guinea-Bissau is still relatively\nrich, diversified and unique. This can be seen from the\ndata below of species count by taxa for Guinea-Bissau\n(Table 1.5).\n\nTable 1.5 - Species count by taxa for Guinea-Bissau.\nAnimal / plant group\nSpecies count\nBirds\n456\nAmphibians\n21\nReptiles\n69\nFishes\n677\nMammals\n123\nVascular plants\n1000\nSource: Amphibians - amphibiaweb; Reptiles - reptile-database; Fish -\nfishbase; Birds - birdlife; Mammals - IUCN; and Plants - World\nConservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP-WCMC).\n\nNevertheless, the pressure has been increasing on the\nrenewable natural assets, in these most recent years,\ndriven not only by natural factors, but mainly by the\nanthropological activities, which have been increasing\nintensively every year due to market demands and the\nextremely poor people's need for survival. As the flora\nof Guinea-Bissau is very rich, plants are intensively used\nin the traditional pharmacopoeia; this practice is deeply\nrooted among the rural communities of the country.\nThese medicinal plants are essentially for the cure of the\nmost frequent diseases, such as: malaria, diarrhea, skin\ndiseases, hepatitis, hypertension, diabetes, snake bites,\namong others. There are however several factors of\npressure on biodiversity mostly originated by human\nactivities. Among others the (i) effects of extensive\nlivestock practiced in the country, mainly in the east and\nnortheast zones, (ii) forest fires sometimes uncontrolled,\nwhich have negative impact on the fauna and floristic\ncomposition; (iii) the pressure of the exponential growth\nof\npopulation\nwith\nrapid\nurbanisation\nwith\ncorresponding needs, including that of woody fuel\n(firewood and coal), (iv) the practice of the traditional\nagriculture based on slash and burn; the wild expansion\nof cashew orchards; the growing production vegetable\ncoal for domestic use as source of energyl and firewood\nsearch, (v) wood exploitation leading to a frightening\ndegradation of the forest potential taking place\nparticularly in the east frontier zones, namely Pirada,\nCanquelifá, Pitche and surroundings, accentuating\nclimate change impacts (GoGB, 2015). Therefore due to\nall these pressures there are currently several species\nunder threat in Guinea-Bissau (Table 1.6).\n\n 22 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nTable 1.6 - Data on threatened species in Guinea-Bissau as of\n2017.\nTaxa\nSpecies count\nThreatened mammals (2018)\n14\nThreatened birds (2018)\n12\nThreatened fishes (2018)\n41\nThreatened higher plants (2018)\n6\n\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau (GoGB), aware of the\ncurrent challenges of this sector has put forward an\nAction Plan for the Strategy for the Biodiversity of\nGuinea-Bissau with the objective to identify solid\nmeasures to accomplish its goals which include:\n• Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and to\npromote its sustainable use;\n• To address the fundamental causes of the biodiversity\nloss, making sure that concerns about the biodiversity\nare\nintegrated\nand\nare\nappropriate\nfor\nthe\ngovernment and for the society in general;\n• To improve the biodiversity situation, protecting\necosystems, species and genetic diversity;\n• To increase the biodiversity benefits and ecosystem\nservices for all;\n• To increase the implementation of the Action Plan\nthrough participating planning, knowledge and\ntraining management.\nThis action plan includes, not only measures of the\nnational responsibility, but also activities to be\nundertaken by the regions and the local communities\nand by other actors that interact with the biodiversity\nand that benefit from the services rendered by the\necosystems.\n\n1.5.6 The National Protected Areas\nThe creation of the Protected Areas for the conservation\nand management of natural resources, one of the\ngreatest achievements of the country and was expected\nto rise to 24% by 2015 and now set at 26.3% in 2017.\nIndeed the Government of Guinea Bissau has\nestablished new protected areas, including the\nDulombi-Boe-Tchétché complex that consists of two\nnational parks and three ecological corridors. So far, the\ninvestment priorities of the country in the area of\nconservation related to the creation of protected areas\nalong the coastal and island area (the Bijagos\nArchipelago) covering almost 15% of the national\nterritory. In order to protect a more complete and\nrepresentative sample of key habitats, efforts made in\nrecent years consisted in developing the national parks\nof Boé and Dulombi on the country’s mainland, close to\nthe border with Senegal and Guinea. These parks now\noffer protection for a remarkable biodiversity such as\nlions, panthers, chimpanzees or elephants. Comprising\nof a Ramsar site, called Wendu Tcham, that is home to\nmajor waterbird populations, in addition to three (3)\nwildlife corridors, the Boé National Park ensures\nconnectivity between the two parks and with the Lagoas\nde Cufada Natural Park and the Cantanhez National\nPark.\nThe National System of Protected Areas of GuineaBissau corresponds to seven protected areas (SEA.\n2019): Parque Natural das Lagoas da Cufada (PNLC),\nParque Nacional de Cantanhez (PNC), Complexo\nDulombi, Boé e Tchetche (DBT), Parque Nacional das\nIlhas de Orango (PNO), Parque Natural dos Tarrafes de\nCacheu (PNTC), terrestrial part of Parque Nacional\nMarinho João Vieira e Poilão (PNMJVP) and Área\nMarinha Protegida Comunitária das Ilhas de Urok\n(AMPCIU). The national protected areas system now\ncovers 26.3% of the national territory, with an extension\nof approximately 750,000ha representing 12.4% of\nmarine protected areas and 13.9% of terrestrial\nprotected areas, which is by and large compliant with\nthe Aichi Targets of the Convention on Biological\nDiversity (CBD).\nThis set of protected areas (Figure 1.4) and their\nrespective area of influence contain the most relevant\nforest, woodland and mangrove patches of the country\nInstitute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP) has\nbeen working in close collaboration with many partners\nto manage these areas, including the Fondation\nBioGuinée, now at the capitalisation stage, which will\nprovide an essential sustainable funding tool for the\nproper management of protected areas (prcmarine,\n2019).\n\n 23| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nFigure 1.4 - The National System of Protected Areas of Guinea-Bissau with corresponding seven protected areas\n(Source: SEA. 2019).\n\n1.6 Key development policies relevant to climate change\n\n1.6.1 Mitigation Policies\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau has elaborated and implemented a wide range of policies that relate\ndirectly or indirectly to climate change and GHG mitigation.\n\n• The Terra law was approved by the National\nAssembly.\nThis\ninstrument\nregulates\nthe\nmanagement of space in the national territory and,\nin particular, brings discipline and minimizes the\nproblems associated with land concessions for\ndifferent purposes. However, this law recognizes\ntwo fundamental aspects: Forest reserves and the\nrecognition of customary law of community land\nmanagement.\n• Framework Law on Protected Areas (PA), an\ninstrument that aims above all to create a legal\nframework conducive to the conservation of fragile\necosystems in Guinea-Bissau. It also regulates the\nclassification system and the declassification of\nprotected areas at national level.\n• Forestry Law: This law updates the rules and forest\ntaxation and are being applied throughout the\nnational territory. This new forestry law attaches\ngreat importance to aspects of reforestation,\noverexploitation in areas where there are sawmills\nand areas with potential problems of land\ndegradation.\n• Mining and Minerals Law. This Law regulates the\ndifferent forms of exploitation of mineral resources\nin the country. Most minerals in the country are in\nforest areas susceptible to degradation in case of\npoor management. The law can contribute to meet\nthe standards of concern for environmental\nprotection. The holder of the operating license\nmust, under penalty of sanctions, strive to reconcile\nthe work of exploitation with the environment. For\nexample, the operating licenses granted to quarries\nin general will only be issued if they are discovered\nthat do not adversely affect the environment.\n• The National Forest Action Plan contains a\ndetailed analysis of the situation based on which\npolicies are defined, strategies, actions and goals to\nbe achieved, to use durable forestry resources, It\n\n 24| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\nalso\ndefines\nthe\nmeans\nnecessary\nfor\nits\nimplementation in the following main issues:\n- Techniques for the use of forest space by the\npopulation to combat food insecurity;\n- Burning for changing in cultivation and for\nhunting;\n- Extensive livestock and increased transhumance;\n- The use of fire as the main instrument of\n\ndeforestation and renovation of pastures;\n- The process of deforestation to create new\nagricultural land for cash crops (especially cashew\nnuts, peanuts and cotton);\n- Overexploitation of forest species of high\ncommercial value;\n- Increase in hunting sites and illegal hunters;\n- Increase in population density and appearance\nof new Tabancas (small villages) in the wildlife\ncorridors.\n• The National Environmental Management Plan\n(NEMP), the main document and regulator of\nenvironmental\nissues\nin\nGuinea-Bissau.\nThis\ndocument contains the main concerns of other\ndevelopment sectors, not only in terms of\nconservation, but also of development itself. The\nplan, through programs and projects, seeks\nsolutions\nto\nensure\nfood\nsecurity,\npoverty\neradication, pollution control and environmental\nsanitation; conservation of natural resources and\ncontrol of the spreading of desertification and soil\nerosion, in addition to minimizing the anthropic\nimpacts that influence climate change. (NEMP,\n2002).\n• The Agenda of action for sustainable Energy for\nall in Guinea-Bissau, accession to the initiative of\nTHE UN Secretary-General, in November 2011, on\nSustainable Energy for all;\n• National Action Plans: Renewable Energies\n(PANER); investment in sustainable energy and\nenergy efficiency in Guinea-Bissau, 2015-2030; In\nthe framework of accession to ECOWAS/UEMOA\nregional policies through the white Paper on\nrenewable energy policy and energy efficiency.\n\n1.6.2 Strategies, plans and objectives linked\nto climate change\nIn order to stabilize the concentration of\ngreenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere at\nlevels that prevent dangerous interference with the\nplanet's climate system, the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climatic Changes\n(UNFCCC) was adopted at 1992. The Kyoto\nProtocol, currently ratified by 192 parties, entered\ninto force in February 2005, and constitutes an\ninstrument that concretizes a global reduction of\nGHG emissions of 5% in the period 2008 to 2012,\ncompared to emissions recorded in 1990. GuineaBissau ratified the UNFCCC on 27 October 1995,\nthus becoming a Contracting Party to the\nConvention, and undertook to develop, update and\nreport to the Conferences of the Parties (COP) The\nnational inventories of GHG emissions and\nremovals. The country ratified the Kyoto Protocol\non 18 November 2005. Being part of the UNFCCC is\nthus committed to participate in the GLOBAL GHG\nreduction efforts, that is, to prevent the planet's\ntemperature from increasing 2ºC and cause\nirreversible damage to the balance of natural\nsystems. Guinea-Bissau has been making efforts\ninternally to become resilient to the effects of\nclimate change, namely:\n• Drafted\nnational\nreports\non\nNational\nCommunications 1, 2 and 3, the National Action\nplan for Adapting to Climate Change;\n• The expansion of its national system of terrestrial\nand marine protected areas is under way, which will\npass from around now 12% of the national territory\nto 26% in 2020;\n• Finalized the National Action Plan for REDD+ as a\ncontribution to the mitigation of greenhouse Gases;\n• The effort to integrate environmental dimension\ninto public policies, promotion and introduction of\nenvironmental education in school curricula and in\nthe preparation of the National Strategy for\nSustainable Development, to influence the Socioeconomic development based on respect for\nenvironment paradigms.\n• In 2012 the United Nations Programme (UNDP)\nfinanced a consultation work aimed at identifying\nbarriers, gaps and capacity needs at institutional,\nhuman and systemic level for a successful\nformulation of Strategy Development to low carbon\nemission (LEDS), NAMAs and MRV system.\nThis work has laid the foundations for adopting the\ncountry with a national greenhouse gas emission\nReduction (GHG) strategy.\n\nWith regard to the implementation of the Kyoto\nProtocol,\nthe\nCARBOVEG-GB\nproject\nwas\nimplemented which brought to light data on the\nquantification of stored carbon and the sink\ncapacity of the forest vegetation of the country.\nHowever, the rate of deforestation at national level\npoints to worrying parameters, and the main\nreasons for this dynamic are itinerant farming, over-\n\n 25| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\ngrazing-exploitation, logging, excessive use of\nfirewood and coal as a source of energy mitigation\nand proliferation of cashew monoculture, among\nothers.\n1.6.3 Institutional arrangements relevant to climate change\nThe country ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 27\nOctober 1995 and ratified also the Kyoto Protocol on 18 November 2005 (IGEE, 2008) thus becoming a\ncontracting Party to the Convention, committed to develop, update, publish the National Communications\non Climate Change and other strategic documents on the same theme and participate in the Conferences\nof the Parties (COP). The national structure that the Guinea-Bissau Government has put in place for the\nregular preparation and reporting of national communication to UNFCCC had evolved from ad-hoc\nworking groups that were set up aiming at attaining permanent decentralized institutional representations\n(see Figure 1.4). The institutional arrangements for national communications and Biennial Update Reports\nare intertwined and integrated into the superstructure for coordination of planning and implementation\nof climate change. Linkages have been established with the National Programme on Climate Change\nCommittee (NPCCC) and the National Climate Change Commission, research and knowledge generation\nstructures.\n\nFigure 1.4 - Institutional arrangement for preparation of BUR 1 in Guinea-Bissau\nCONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (COP)\nUNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC)\nREPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU\nSECRETARIAT OF SATE FOR ENVIRONMENT AND\nBIODIVERSITE (SSEB)\n\nUNFCCC FOCAL POINT\n\nGEF FOCAL POINT\nNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE\nCOMMISSION\nInterdisciplinary Environment Body\n Government\nPrime Minister\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Intl.\nCooperation\nMinistry of Education and Scientific\nResearch\nMinistry of Natural Resources\nMinistry of Public Work, Housing and\nUrbanism\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment\nMinistry of Public Health\nMinistry of Interior\nMinistry of Energy and Industry\nMinistry\nof\nTrade,\nTourism\nand\nHandicraft\nMinistry of the Economy and Finance\nMinistry of Family, Woman and Fight\nagainst Poverty\nSecretariat of State for Environment\nSecretariat of State for Fishery and\nMarine Economy\nSecretariat of State for Transports and\ncommunications\nOther National Stakeholders\nLocal Government\nAcademic and Research Institutions\nWorkers Unions\nCommunity-Based Organizations (CBO)\nEnvironment NGOs\nAd-Hoc Project Steering\nCommittees\nNATIONAL PROGRAMME ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nCOMMITTEE (NPCCC)\nInterdisciplinary Members\nI\nBUR1 PROJECT COORDINATION UNIT:\nProject National Director (PND)\nProject National Coordinator (PNC)\nAdministrative and Financial Assistant\n(AFA)\n\nAdaptation Team Leader\nCross-cutting Issues\nTeam Leader\nMitigation Team Leader\n\n 26| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 1: National Circumstances\n\nBelow in Table 1.4 is the description of the main stakeholders involved in the preparation of the BUR 1 as\nwell as their main responsibility.\n\nTable 1.4.

Introduction\nGuinea-Bissau is a non-Annex-I Party and a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. National communications (CNs) and the biennial\nupdate reports (BUR) are part of all the obligations of the country’s parties to the UNFCCC, through which\nthey disclose the state of implementation of the Convention at national level in its different modalities.\nWhile the CNs provides Information on GHG emissions, vulnerability and climate change adaptation\nmeasures, mitigation or emission mitigation options, etc., bi-annual reports (BUR) on their side seek to\nupdate and strengthen the information contained in the CNs. Consequently, within this framework, GuineaBissau is preparing its First Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange to the COP. This First Biennial Update Report (BUR) seek to update and strengthen the information\ncontained in the Third National Communication. Therefore, the inventory estimate carried out under this\nBUR covers anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all GHG not controlled by the\nMontreal Protocol and greenhouse gas precursors and include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and\nnitrous oxide (N2O) and the indirect gases nitrogen oxides (NOx). This section of the report presents a\nsummary of the GHG results for the period 2006 -2012 (based on emission inventory statistics from 2010).\n\n 31| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.2. Socio-economic characterization\nof the country\nBissau the capital, is the largest urban centre and\neconomic and institutional centre of the country\nwith approximately 20% of the total population. The\nother major urban centres are the cities of, Gabu,\nBafatá, Canchungo and Bassorã, where there are\nsome important economic activities in the\nagricultural areas and the main transport routes.\nBesides these, there is another group of secondary\ncenters that in the past reflected some economic\nglow, such as Catió, Cachéu, Bolama and Bubaque.\n\nBissau City Center Bissau, - Francisco Mendes Avenue\nThe economy of Guinea-Bissau is mainly based on\nthe primary sector and international aid. The\nagriculture sector (mainly cashew cultivation) and\nfisheries contribute to about half of GDP, with\nservices being the second main contributor. The\nindustry sector is very poorly developed and\ncontributes less than 15% to the formation of\nnational GDP (Figure 2.1).\n\nFigure 2.1 – Guinea-Bissau’s GDP breakdown for 2016.\nThe trade balance (imports/exports) was always\nnegative, although it had presented a positive trend\nin recent years. Unilateral bank transfers represent\nan important part of GDP, taking into account that\nthey\nalso include\ntransfers\nfor\ncommercial\npurposes. The following table presents some\neconomic and social indicators relevant to the\ncontext of the present study.

The energy sector characterization\nThe energy Sector of Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed in the West-African sub-region,\nreflecting the low level of access of its populations to modern energy. In fact, the rate of access to energy\nof 16% in 2015 versus 11.5% in 2010 (of which only 10% relative to the network) reveals the undeniable delay\nof the country in relation to the same context in the sub-region and evidences, in particular, the perverse\neffects of erratic socio-economic development status of the country over the last decades. Apart from the\nfossil energy resources to be confirmed, it is considered that Guinea-Bissau is a country with many primary\nenergy resources, especially renewable, such as sun, wind, water and forests. The latter are the most\nexploited resource, due to the low technical and financial costs associated with its exploitation. It is\nimportant to underline that given the weak level of access to energy in Guinea-Bissau, all the production\nof primary energy is normally consumed in its entirety. According to the Energy Master Plan of 2013, the\nAgriculture\n49%\nIndustry\n14%\nServices\n37%\nGDP Breakdown (%), 2016\n\n 32| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nin-country supply of energy is mainly based on woody biomass (firewood and coal), which represents 87%\n(360.21 ktoe) of total primary energy production, supplemented by petroleum products (13%,\ncorresponding to 52.38 ktoe) which the latter is mostly imported (Figure 2.2).\n\n2.3.1 Electricity\nThe energy Sector of Guinea-Bissau is among the\nleast developed. The national electricity sub-sector\nhas evolved in line with the country's socioeconomic development profile, often with abrupt\ndeclines following timid progress. Since its\nindependence, Guinea-Bissau has known countless\nsocio-political crises that have had as its outcome\nrecurrent periods of instability in the sector's\npolicies\nand\nlegislations/regulations.\nThe\ninvestments for their development were postponed\nand delayed for decades, mainly due to the lack of\nconfidence of the private sector and development\npartners. However, currently the Government\nlaunched The National Action Plans for Renewable\nEnergy and Energy Efficiency to provide a coherent\nvision how to achieve universal access to\nsustainable energy services so to rapidly reduce the\ncountry’s dependence on diesel imports for power\ngeneration.\n\nFigure 2.2 – Partitioning of supply of primary energy in\nGuinea-Bissau for 2013.\n\n2.3.2 Energy consumption\nEnergy consumption in Guinea Bissau is still\ndominated by the Residential Sector, with almost\n92%, corresponding to 339 ktoe, followed by the\nTransport Sector.\nResidential Sector ― Biomass (firewood) continued\nto determine domestic consumption, with more\nthan 95%, followed by oil derivatives with about 5%.\n\nThe\ncountry's\nweak\nelectrification\nrate has\ncontinued to constrain household access, especially\nin rural areas, to modern electricity services,\njustifying\nnegligible\nelectricity\nconsumption.\nFirewood is by far the main fuel, with a demand of\nthe order of 89% of total consumption of biomass\nin rural households. Next comes the charcoal, fuel\nmainly used in the capital Bissau and which leads to\nexaggerated quantities of wood being cut from\nnational forests. Petroleum fuels, whether kerosene,\ndiesel or domestic gas, are rarely used in the\nkitchen. Kerosene and diesel fuel are mainly used\nfor home lighting, which reflects the low\nconsumption of electricity. But butane gas (LPG) is\nalso mostly used in urban centres, particularly in the\ncapital, although not massively, as most city\ndwellers remain dependent on coal and firewood,\nsuch as the bakery, military barracks and hospital\ncentres (Figure 2.3).\n\nFigure 2.3 – Consumption by type of energy in the\nResidential Sector of Guinea Bissau.\nTransport Sector ― In the Transport Sector, energy\nconsumption is dominated by the Road Transport\nSubsector (83%) in the form of diesel and gasoline,\nfollowed at a distance (6%) by the Air Subsector (Jet\nA or Gasoline Aviation) and by 1% of inland\nMaritime Navigation. essentially characterized by\ncabotage and artisanal fishing. In total, the final\nenergy consumption of the Transport Sector\nreached 34.07 ktoe in 2010.\n\nWoody\nBiomass\n(firewood\nand coal)\n87%\nOil\nProducts\n13%\nSupply of Primary Energy\nFirewood\n88,73%\nCharcoal\n6,42%\nDiesel and\nLubricants\n4,56%\nGasoline\n0,08%\nLPG\n0,18%\nElectricity\n0,03%\nConsumption by type of energy,\nResidential Sector\n\n 33| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.4. Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nThe inventory estimate carried out in the context of this BRU1 covers anthropogenic emissions by\nanthropogenic sources and removals by sinks of all GHG not controlled by the Montreal protocol and the\nprecursors of gas greenhouse effect and includes carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide\n(N2O) and indirect gases oxides of nitrogen (NOx).\n\nForest resources constitute more than 87% of the\ncountry's domestic energy needs, of which wood is\nthe most used by the population. Problems in this\nsector are related to deforestation, pastoralism, soil\nerosion, irregularity and reduced rainfall and\nincreasing population in forest areas, in short,\npressure on biodiversity.\nWhether from clearing for cultivation, local\nharvesting of wood, or for external commercial\nmarkets, the forest resources have been heavily\ndegraded by rapid exploitation. The rate of\ndeforestation has increased from about 2 percent\nper year between 1975 and 2000 to 3.9 percent over\nthe 2000 to 2013 period. Overall, Guinea-Bissau lost\nabout 77 percent of its forests between 1975 and\n2013; only 180 sq km remain, mainly in the south\nnear the Guinea border. Likewise, woodlands\nregressed by 35 percent over the 38 years, a loss of\n1,750 sq km (USAID, 2015). Successive cutting of the\ntrees and their commercialization by the population\nis currently under way to guarantee the financial\nmeans for their subsistence in rural areas. Even with\nthe extensive practice of pastoralism, logging, the\ntraditional practice of highland agriculture on tree\ncutting and burning of forests are major causes of\nforest degradation in the country. According to\nGovernment authorities, it is estimated that\nbetween 50,000 and 80,000 ha of forests are\nburned annually for farming and hunting. The\ninventory carried out from 1978 to 1985 showed\nthat the forest space had decreased about 31,500\nha in this period being Afzelia africana, Khaya\nsenegalensis and Pterocarpus erinaceus the three\nspecies most sought.\n\nHowever more recent data indicate an alarming scenario on forest degradation in the country.\nDeforestation measured as tree cover loss assessed from 2001 to 2018 for different \"tree cover threshold\"\nused for defining the tree cover area from dense forests (≥75% close canopies) to open forests (≥10%\nsparse canopies) indicate systematic losses across all threshold values (Figure 2.4).\n\nFigure 2.4 – Deforestation measured as tree cover loss assessed from 2001 to 2018 for different \"tree cover threshold”\nfor Guinea-Bissau 2001-2018 (Data Source: https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Guinea-Bissau.htm)\n\nForest degradation in open canopies are extremely high with more than 230,000 ha lost in the open forests\nof Guinea-Bissau. Yearly average losses varied from 6064 ha during the 2001-2010 period to 21,176 ha\nbetween 2011 and 2018. Forest degradation gradually decreases with increasing cover threshold (≥75%\nclose canopies) reaching 1,213 ha of tree cover within the 18 years period.

Even though the total land\nsurface covered by savanna has stayed virtually\nunaffected, the underlying dynamic is not so simple.\nThe Agricultural areas have doubled since 1975\ncovering 13 percent of the national land surface in\n2013 and becoming the second most extensive land\ncover class. Forest clearance for cultivation has\ninfringed into natural habitats in all of Guinea-\nBissau’s ecoregions except the Zone de Colline de\nBoé (ZCB – Boé Hill or Upland Zone). Whereas\nagricultural expansion explains the loss of about\n2,500 sq km of savannas (or 16 percent of their 1975\ntotal land surface), the degradation of woodlands\nand forests from logging and clearing has\nproduced open landscapes that take on the\ncharacteristics of tree and wooded savannahs,\nincreasing the area mapped as savannah in the\nsame period. Deforestation for wood production is\nresponsible for 65 percent of forest habitat losses\n(forests, woodlands, gallery forests), or 1,700 sq km\nof forest that have become savannahs in 2013.\nAgriculture in shallows and recession, in particular\nrice cultivation, colonizes alluvial floodplains in the\nZone des Estuaires (E-GB – Estuary Zone) and the\nZone Côtière (ZC-GB – Coastal Zone). Rice\ncultivated areas have slightly increased in GuineaBissau since 1975, encroaching into wetlands,\ngallery forest and mangroves. Mangroves are one\nof the major land cover classes in Guinea- Bissau,\naccounting for over 9 percent of the country’s land\nsurface. This fragile ecosystem is critical to coastal\npeople who take advantage of its rich fisheries and\nwood resources. They also use the tidal flats for\ntraditional rice cultivation (Corcoran, Ravilious, and\nSkuja, 2007). Between 1975 and 2013, mangroves\ndecreased by 6.4 percent, or 220 sq km. Bowé,\nlateritic landscapes that characterize Guinean\nplateaus, cover 3.2 percent of the country’s land\nsurface and are mainly found in the Colline de Boé\n(ZCB – Boé Hill or Upland Zone) ecoregions. These\nrocky, impenetrable soils are usually devoid of\nwoody vegetation but support an herbaceous cover\nduring the rainy season. As a result, bowé is one of\nthe most stable landscapes in Guinea-Bissau. Bowé\nis ill-suited to agriculture but conducive to grazing\n(USAID, 2015). All these partial losses in the various\ntypes of forest stand explain the staggering amount\nof total tree cover loss of 1,019,531 ha within the 18\nyears period which leads to an average yearly rate\nof tree cover loss of 56, 640 ha/year.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is an essentially agricultural and subsistence economy and agriculture remains a dominant\neconomic activity contributing to over 50% of GDP and over 80% of exports and employing around 82%\nof the working population. Rice ranks first in the government's medium- and long-term priorities for its\nplace in Guinea-Bissau's food and economy. According to estimated data from the Ministry of Agriculture\nand Rural Development (MADR) Agricultural Statistics Department, the country has 1,410,000 ha of arable\nland (agricultural potential), of which 200,000 ha of land with rice (bas-fonds rice), 106,000 ha of land with\nmangrove rice, and 110,000 ha land with pam pam rice, where forests are also found (Table 2.3).\n\n 35| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nTable 2.3 - Agricultural Statistics of the country.\n\nHowever, a growing expansion of cattle ecosystem (Table 2.4), and cashew cultivation, with the appearance\nof uncontrolled burning of forests that can significantly alter these data. This practice of extensive cattle\nranching has caused many conflicts between cattle breeders and farmers and other impacts (positive and\nnegative) in the agricultural system.\n\nTable 2.4 - Evolution of National livestock herd (extrapolated data 2013).\n\n2.5.

To overcome this\nhandicap and with a view to accomplish the\nobjectives of the BUR1, an update of sectoral data\nand information was carried. Data was gathered\nfrom sources of activities through observations,\ninterviews and surveys of the actors. During the\ninterviews and surveys, the researcher collected two\ntypes of data: primary and secondary. The primary\ndata were collected through interviews conducted\nat different public, private, NGO and communitybased organizations, including women responsible\nfor households. Teams financed by the BUR1\nproject, consisting of administration technicians,\nuniversity students and young people residing in\nthe visited locations, conducted the scheduled\nsurveys according to a mobilization plan that was\nstretched to most representative centres of the\nnational territory, involving not only the rural\ncommunities where the consumption of firewood is\npredominant and where the coal farmers produce\nthe charcoal, but also the secondary centres\n(regional and sectoral capitals), and finally the city\nof Bissau, which concentrates the main economic\nactivities using the final energy.\n\nWood Charcoal selling in Guinea-Bissau. Photo credit: LOPES\nJ.R., 2018\n\nAccording\nto\nthe\nnational\ncommunications\nprepared to date, the Energy Sector, has been\nconsidered one of the catalysts of economic\ndevelopment by the Strategic and Operational Plan\nfor 2015-2020 – “TERRA RANKA” Therefore the\nenergy Sector-is part of the preparation of the\nBiennial Update Report (BUR1) of Guinea-Bissau.\n2.6. Methodology\nAccording to the secretariat of the UNFCCC, the\nBUR of non-Annex I countries, of which GuineaBissau is part, will undergo an international\nverification\nprocess\nthrough\ninternational\nconsultancy and analysis. The inventory is at the\nnational level and covers all the IPCC sectors subject\nto availability of activity data. As per the IPCC 2006\nGuidelines, emission estimates have been compiled\nfor the four sectors: Energy, Agriculture, Forestry,\nand Other Land Use (AFOLU), Industrial Processes\nand Product Use (IPPU) and Waste. The gases\ncovered in this inventory are the direct gases\ncarbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous\noxide (N2O) and the indirect gases nitrogen oxides\n(NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane\nvolatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and sulphur\ndioxide (SO2).\n\nEmissions are attributable to the combustion of\nfossil fuels, but also to the burning of plant biomass,\ni.e. firewood and charcoal. Taking into account the\nuncertainties associated to the data used for the\nactivity sectors, given the different constraints and\nstructural gaps referred to in the preceding\nchapters, it was decided to apply the tier 1 (or Level\n1) method, recommended in the manual \"IPCC\nGuidelines, 2006 \" for situations when the body in\ncharge of the inventory has few resources and\nlimited data gathering structures. This method is\nbased in fuel, with the assumption that the\nattributable emissions from combustion sources\ncan be calculated from the quantities of burnt fuels\nand the average emission factors (F). Emissions of\ngases other than CO2 contain small amounts of\ncarbon. In relation to estimates of CO2 and, in Tier\n1, it becomes more correct to base the calculation\nof CO2 in total amount of carbon contained in the\nfuel. In fact, while the total carbon in the fuel\ndepends only on the type of fuel, emissions of other\ngases other than CO2 depend on numerous factors,\nsuch as the type of technology, maintenance, etc.,\nwhich, in general, are not known. As known, the\nemission factors vary according to the type of gas\nunder analysis Therefore, CO2 emissions can be\naccurately calculated based on the total quantity of\nburnt fuels and the average carbon content of the\nfuels.\n\n 37| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.7. National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory\n2.7.1 National emissions and removals (Gg)\nGHG emissions were calculated (Table 2.5) using the IPCC Inventory software program created for this\npurpose and based on information on the energetic balance (Reference Year: 2010). The results from these\nemissions calculations indicate that the bulk of GHG emissions in the energy Sector, in the referential year\nof 2010, was concentrated in the residential subsector and represented by carbon dioxide emissions (94%).\nThese results also suggest a high consumption of firewood and charcoal in households both in urban\ncentres and in Rural areas. Emissions are attributable to the combustion of fossil fuels, but also to the\nburning of plant biomass, i.e. firewood and charcoal.\n\nTable 2.5 – Summary of Green House Gas Emissions in the Energy Sector (extrapolated data 2013).\nSectors of\nActivity\nEnergy consumed\nTJ\nGreenhouse Gases emitted\n(Gg)\nCO2\nCH4\nN2O\n1.

In\naddition to the mandatory ' top-down ' approach\nfor\nestimating\nGHG\nemissions\nfrom\nfuel\ncombustion, the bottom-up methodology was used\nas much as possible for key inventory categories,\nusing the existing databases available in GuineaBissau. The majority of GHG was emitted (Gg\nCO2eq) in the Energy and Agriculture and Livestock\nsectors. The contributions of Industry and Waste\nsectors were marginal. The summary of the results\nbased on the data of 2010 is shown in Figure 2.5.\n\nEnergy\n\nAgriculture\n\nWaste\n\nIndustry\n\nFigure 2.5 – The contributions of GHG emissions in the Energy sector, Agriculture, Industry and Waste sectors in\nGuinea-Bissau (2010).\n\n94%\n2%\n4%\nSolid waste\nWaste water and\nSludge\nHuman waste\n27%\n10%\n4%\n1%\n58%\nLivestock\nPaddy Rice\nAgriculture Waste\nBurning of\nSavannahs\nLand Cultivation\n35%\n3%\n3%\n2%\n0%\n1%\n54%\n2%\nTransport\nComercial &\nInstitutional\nSelf-generation,\nown generation\nInternational\nBunkers\nAgriculture &\nFisheries\n Industrial Sector\nOil products\n2%\n70%\n28%\nCashew nut wine\nCashew nut bandy\nSugar cane brandy\n\n 41| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nThe graphs below show the percentage values according to the contribution of different sub sectors that\nmake up the AFOLU sector in Guinea-Bissau (Figure 2.6a) and the GHG emissions according to gases for\n2010 inventory (Figure 2.6b).\n\nFigure 2.6 – a) The percentage contributions of the AFOLU sub sectors; and b) distribution of emissions by gas (2010).\n\nIt can be observed that GHG emission from Land\nUse and Change dominated the AFOLU sector\nfollowed by the Livestock sub sector. CO2 emissions\ndominate the total GHG emissions by representing\n-573.6 Gg CO2eq, followed by CH4 with 112.3, N2O\nwith 7.5 and halogenated gases with 0.02.\n\n2.8. Projections of Greenhouse Gases\nThe projection of GHG emissions serves to estimate\nthe future evolution of the country's emissions\nprofile in the context of the sector's activities and to\nmake sure that they maintain their normal course\nand pace, without the need for interventions that\nmay influence the socioeconomic activity. After the\ncalculations using the IPCC methodology, the\nemission results for Guinea-Bissau and all these\nyears ahead 2020, 2030 and 2050 correspond to\nzero (0). That is to say that, until the last year of this\nprojection, Guinea-Bissau will not be a net emitter\nof none of the AFOLU-related greenhouse gases\ndue to the high sequestration capacity of the\nnational forests.\n\nIt is true that under the baseline scenario, all GHG emissions are projected to gradually rise from the base\nyear (2010) to 2050 particularly in the Agriculture and Livestock and the Waste sectors, that are expected\nto experience a dramatic increase in GHG emission. These GHG emission increases are made markedly\nfrom an accentuated growth in CH4 gas. This can be seen in Figure 2.8 showing the evolution of GHG\nemissions for 1994, 2006 and 2010, aggregated in Gg CO2-eq and Gg by gas in Guinea-Bissau.\nTable 2.8 – Emissions for 1994, 2006 and 2010, aggregated in Gg CO2-eq and Gg by gas in Guinea-Bissau.\nSource\nBase Year\nGreenhouse Gas Emission\nTotal\n(Gg-Eq CO2)4\nCO2\n(Gg)\nCH4\n(Gg)\nN2O\n(Gg)\nNC 1\n1994\n178.58\n0.36\n0.99\n179.90\nNC 2\n2006\n156,00\n79.59\n6.20\n241.79\n\nBUR 1\n2010\n1338.79\n87.26\n130.58\n1556.64\n\n4 The Total was obtained after application of the Global warming potentials of the Gees Referenced (GWP: CO2 = 1; Ch4 = 21; N2O =\n310, established by the IPCC in its report AR5 of 2014).\n112.3\n-573.6\n7.5\nTotal Emissions by Gas\nCH4\nCO2\nN2O\nNox\nCO\n15%\n2%\n-82%\n-1%\nAmounts as a percentage of emissions in\nthe AFOLU Sector\nGado\nEmissões de\nGases ñ CO2 em\nTerras Quiemadas\nTerras\nOutros\nLivestock\nNon-CO2 gas\nemissions in\nburned land\nLand Use &\nChange\nemissions\nOther\n\n 42| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nThe rising demand for food (paddy rice crop and\nmeat production) will drive the expected increases\nin emissions of CH4 in the baseline scenario\nespecially in the Agriculture & Livestock sector. The\nrelease of CH4 will stem mainly from the decay of\nflooded organic matter in paddy rice crop and from\nenteric fermentation from the livestock sub-sector.\nGHG emission from enteric fermentation from\nLivestock sector will keep its growing pace as\nthe Guinea-Bissau agriculture system is still\ndominated by the practice of extensive cattle\nranching characterised by sedentary livestock\nbreeding as well as transhumance livestock\nproduction. In addition, there are expectation\nthat the Industry sector of Guinea-Bissau will\nincrease, given the population growth and the\ntechnological advance expected to see happening\nin the current industry sectors and those new\nemerging activities so that the GHG emission in this\nsector\nmay\nalso\nincrease.\nFurthermore,\nDeforestation is also responsible for the release of\nlarge amounts of CO2 by loosening up carbon\nstored in forest soils, increasing the chances it will\nreturn to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and by\nreducing the carbon sequestration capacity of the\ncountry.\n\nNotwithstanding the above expected rises in\nGHG emission, the Land Use, Land-Use Change\nand Forestry (LULUCF) is still the highest single\nsector acting as a net sink of GHG amounting to 10718 Gg for the year 2010. Therefore, GuineaBissau is and will remain as an absolute sink of\ngreenhouse gases, given the high potential for\nsequestration by the Forestry sub-sector and the\nFramework Law on sustainable development\npromoting the expansion of the national Protected\nAreas as well as the implementation of the country's\nbiodiversity protection policy.\n\n 43| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 2: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory\n2.9.

However, Guinea-Bissau being\ncommitted to fulfil the objectives of article 2, of the\nConvention,\nspecifically\nthe\n\"stabilisation\nof\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere at a level that would prevent\ndangerous anthropic interference in the climate\nsystem\", has developed several policies and\nstrategies that guide its development agenda,\npromoting sustainable development, minimizing\nthe social, environmental and economic impacts of\nanthropogenic\nactivities\nthat\ncontribute\nto\ngreenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, to global\nwarming. Guinea-Bissau has been involved in\nvarious projects and activities aimed at reducing\nGHG emissions and increasing its sink capacity,\nparticularly through its\nEnergy, Forest and\nBiodiversity sectors.\n\n3.2.1 The national mitigation System\nGuinea-Bissau's\nNational\nMitigation\nSystem\nconsists of an entire institutional, legal chain of\nprocesses and arrangement made to estimate\nemission reductions, as well as the reporting and\narchiving of mitigation information. The Directorate\nGeneral for the Environment (DGA) of the Republic\nof Guinea-Bissau is the designated mitigation\nassessment agency and hosts the UNFCCC and GEF\nfocal points. It is responsible for National Climate\nChange Communications and is also the state\nauthority\nresponsible\nfor\ndeveloping\nand\npromoting policies and strategies for mitigating /\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country\nin the short, medium and long term through\nenvironmental protection, rational use of natural\nresources and biodiversity conservation. The other\nmain national bodies relevant to the climate change\nmitigation legal framework are:\n1. The National Authority designated for the Kyoto\nMechanisms (DNA)-created by Decree No. 11/2006,\ndated August 22nd. DNA is a national body that\ndeals with the approval and monitoring of the\nimplementation of projects under the Clean\ndevelopment Mechanism and REDD framework.\n2. The National Committee on Climate Change\n(NCCC)-is supervised by The Secretariat of State of\nEnvironment and Biodiversity (SEAB) and consists of\nan advisory board, a Scientific Council and a\ntechnical committee. The role of the NCCC is to\nstimulate the awareness and mobilization of\nGuinean Society for discussion and position in\nrelation to the phenomenon of climate change, with\nthe following main mitigation objectives:\n▪ Discuss and validate the mitigation/mitigation\nmeasures of greenhouse gas emissions in the\ncountry, in the short, medium and long term;\n▪ (b) Discussing and validating measures to adapt\nto the adverse effects of climate change;\n▪ c) Discuss and validate the implementation of\nincentive instruments and measures to mitigate the\nimpacts of climate change and natural disasters;\n▪ d) Discuss and validate ways to stimulate the\nconsumption or use of products with zero carbon\ncontent;\n▪ e) Promote the implementation of projects under\nthe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as well\nas other innovative forms of mitigation/reduction\nfinancing.\n\nWithin SEAB, the NCCC unit carries out the daily\nsupervision of the mitigation assessment and is\nresponsible for organizing and developing the\nactivities included in the annual work plan for the\nsector mitigation teams, assisting in the request for\ndata and Ensuring that tasks are submitted on time.\nThis unit is also responsible for identifying the\nvarious institutions that constitute the mitigation\nassessment\nWorking\nGroup.\nThe\nNational\nmitigation\nWork\nGroup\nincludes\nministerial\nrepresentatives from the main sectors involved in\nthe national mitigation inventory, such as energy,\nwaste management, AFLOU and cross-cutting\nissues.\n\n3.3 Voluntary Pledge\nNotwithstanding the expected rises in GHG\nemission in Guinea-Bissau, as deliberated in\nthe preceding chapter, the quantum of\nGuinea-Bissau’s total GHG emissions (including\n\nLULUCF) in 2010 was: -10718 Gg/year. This level of\nemission is far lower than GHG emissions of China,\nUSA, the EU and for example India’s per capita GHG\nemission in 2010 which was 1.56 metric tonnes\nCO2eq. The Guinea-Bissau’s emission pattern is\n\n 48| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nsuch that Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry\n(LULUCF) is still the highest single sector acting as a\nnet sink of GHG in 2010. By contrast, GHG emissions\nfrom oil products and transport are significant in\nthe Energy Sector and so does the GHG emissions\nfrom land cultivation and livestock in the\nAgriculture and livestock sectors.\n\nDeforestation and wildfires are also responsible for\nemitting\nlarge\namounts\nof\nCO2\ninto\nthe\natmosphere. It is therefore, under this background\nand in accordance with the provisions of Article 12,\nparagraphs 1(b) and 4, and Article 10, paragraph\n2(a), of the Convention, that Guinea-Bissau\ncommunicated its voluntary pledge to reduce the\nemissions\nintensity.\nConsequently,\nthe\nmain\nmitigation measure to be adopted by the country,\nas\na\nnational\ncontribution,\nis\nrelated\nto\nreforestation. The second sector that the country\nplans in using to contribute to the mitigation\nstrategy is the Energy sector even though the\naverage electrification rate of the country is about\n12% and Guinea-Bissau remains one of the\ncountries facing the greatest need of access to\nmodern forms of energy in Africa and the world.\n\nWildfires in Guinea-Bissau\n\n3.3 National Mitigation Policies\nThe above legal structure that supports the processes and arrangements to estimate the emission\nreduction, as well as the monitoring of the results, is sustained mainly in:\n• The new forestry Law, Decree-Law 5/2011, establishes the rule of law concerning the management of\nforest heritage, forestry planning, sale of forestry products, forest management and exploration contracts,\nforest cleaning, prevention and combating Forest fire and community forests.\n\nHowever, the Government of Guinea-Bissau has\nelaborated and implemented a wide range of\npolicies that relate directly or indirectly to climate\nchange and GHG mitigation:\n• The Land Law (“Lei de Terra”) was approved by the\nPopular National Assembly (ANP). This instrument\nregulates the management of space in the national\nterritory and, in particular, brings discipline and\nminimizes the problems associated with land\nconcessions for different purposes. However, this\nlaw recognizes two fundamental aspects. Forest\nreserves and the recognition of customary law of\ncommunity land management.\n• Framework Law on Protected Areas (PA), an\ninstrument that aims above all to create a legal\nframework conducive to the conservation of fragile\necosystems in Guinea-Bissau. It also regulates the\nclassification system and the declassification of\nprotected areas at national level.\n• Forestry Law-2011: The rules and forest taxation\nhave been updated and are being applied\nthroughout the national territory. This new forestry\nlaw attaches great importance to aspects of\nreforestation, overexploitation in areas where there\nare sawmills and areas with potential problems of\nland degradation.\n• Mining and Minerals law. This Law regulates the\ndifferent forms of exploitation of mineral resources\nin the country. Most minerals in the country are in\nforest areas susceptible to degradation in case of\npoor management. The law can contribute to meet\nthe standards of concern for environmental\nprotection.\nProtected Area Cacheu -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\n\n 49| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nThe holder of the operating licence must, under\npenalty of sanctions, strive to reconcile the work of\nexploitation with the environment. For example, the\noperating licenses granted to quarries in general\nwill only be issued if they are discovered that do not\nadversely affect the environment.\n• The National Forest Executive Plan (National\nForest Action Plan) contains a detailed analysis of\nthe situation on which policies are defined, the\nstrategies, actions and goals to be achieved, the use\nof durable forestry resources amongst others. It\nalso\ndefines\nthe\nmeans\nnecessary\nfor\nits\nimplementation in the following main issues:\n\n-Techniques for the use of forest space by the\npopulation to fight food insecurity;\n-Burning linked to shifting cultivation and hunting;\n-Extensive livestock and increased transhumance;\n-The use of fire as the main instrument of\ndeforestation and renovation of pastures;\n-The process of deforestation to create new\nagricultural land for cash crops (especially cashew\nnuts, peanuts and cotton);\n-Overexploitation of forest species of high\ncommercial value;\n-Increase in hunting camps and illegal hunters;\n-Increase in population density and appearance of\nnew Tabancas (small villages) in the wildlife\ncorridors.\n• The National Environmental Management Plan\n(NEMP), the main document and regulator of\nenvironmental\nissues\nin\nGuinea-Bissau.\nThis\ndocument contains the main concerns of other\ndevelopment sectors, not only in terms of\nconservation, but also of development itself. The\nplan, through programs and projects, seeks\nsolutions\nto\nensure\nfood\nsecurity,\npoverty\neradication, pollution control and environmental\nsanitation; Conservation of natural resources and\ncontrol of the spreading of desertification and soil\nerosion, in addition to minimizing the anthropic\nimpacts that influence climate change. (NEMP,\n2002).\n• The Agenda of Action for Sustainable Energy for\nAll in Guinea-Bissau, accession to the initiative of\nThe UN Secretary-General, in November 2011, on\nSustainable Energy for all;\n• National Action Plans: Renewable Energies\n(PANER); investment in sustainable energy and\nenergy efficiency in Guinea-Bissau, 2015-2030; In\nthe framework of accession to ECOWAS/UEMOA\nregional policies through the white Paper on\nRenewable Energy Policy and the Energy Efficiency\n\n3.4 Mitigation Policy Measures\nThe Guinea-Bissau mitigation strategy encompasses the implementation of unconditional actions and\npolicies complemented by other conditional measures supported mainly by bilateral or international\nfunding. Unconditional mitigation actions include legislative initiatives (laws, acts, policies, regulations and\nmandates) that are promulgated to protect and administer the environment and are adopted by the\nGovernment of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to facilitate reduction of GHG emissions. In addition, this is\ncomplemented by the national implementation of specific energy-saving policies and the prolonged use\nof alternative energy sources, in accordance with the measures provided for in the existing national strategy\npapers. These strategic documents include the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP II) and the\nnational strategic document-TERRA RANKA 2015-2025.\n\nThe mitigation measures are based on published\ndocuments and the consultation carried out by the\nnational\nteam\nwith\nstakeholders\nfor\nthe\ndevelopment of the third communication. Due to\nthe lack of detailed preliminary studies to formulate\nquantifiable concrete actions, the period up to 2020\nshould be devoted to in-depth studies to enable\nthe implementation of measures in forestry,\nindustry and energy. For example, reforestation,\nconservation of other forests and a program for the\ninclusion of renewable energy sources in the\ncountry's energy mix.\n\n3.4.1 Mitigation measures in the\nAgriculture and Forestry sector (AFLOU)\nIn comparison with other countries in the subregion, Guinea-Bissau seems to have preserved its\nenvironmental\nequilibrium.\nHowever,\nthe\nintensification of economic activities in certain\nareas, such as agriculture and fisheries, and in the\nextractive industries in particular, can be a real\nthreat to the ecosystem and the sustainability of\nnatural resources. The problems of this specific\nsector are related to deforestation (through forest\nfires, illegal timber extraction, removal of firewood\n\n 50| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nused directly or to produce coal), excessive grazing,\nsoil erosion, irregularity and decreased rainfall and\nincreased population in forest areas, finally,\npressure on forest and soil degradation and\nconsequently the loss of biodiversity. Therefore,\nthere is an urgent need to act in order to adapt and\nmitigate the adverse effects of climate change and\nanthropogenic damage to the country's natural\nresources.\n\nProtected Area -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\n\nSince the mitigation actions available, such as\nnatural regeneration, short-spin forestry and\nbioenergy for replacing fossil fuels, are not currently\npracticable mitigation options, the Government of\nGuinea-Bissau has capitalized efforts to Mitigation\nin the action of forest protection with a focus on the\nestablishment and effective management of\nprotected areas (APs).\n\nProtected Areas (APs) are areas normally classified\nby Decree with the purpose of safeguarding certain\necosystems as well as the populations of animals\nand plants that housed by them, their ecological\ndiversity as well as promoting their sustainable\nsocial and economic use. The Guinea-Bissau\nNational Protected Areas Network currently has six\nMarine and Coastal Parks, and the expansion\nprocess to 26.3% of the national territory was\naccomplished through the \"Support Project for the\nConsolidation of a System of Protected Areas in the\nForest Belt\". Guinea-Bissau \", which aimed at the\ncreation of the last five new Protected Areas in the\nDulombi, Boé and Tchetche (DBT) complex. These\nnew areas just being created retain biodiversity\nvalues of rare importance, such as chimpanzees and\nsub-humid Guinean forests with high development\npotentials, particularly in the tourism sector\n(ecotourism). Examples of Guinea-Bissau Protected\nAreas are:\n\n• Bolama Bijagós Archipelago Biosphere Reserve\n• Urok Islands Community Protected Marine Area\n• Cantanhez National Park\n• João Vieira Marine National Park and Poilão\n• Orango Islands National Park\n• Cufada Ponds Natural Park\n• Cacheu Mangrove Natural Park (“Tarrafes”)\n• Dulombi, Boe and Tchetche Complex (DBT)\n\nThe above complex represents the National System\nof Protected Areas (SNAP). Currently, the National\nSystem of Protected Areas (SNAP) covers a total\nsurface of about 750,000 ha, or about 26,3% of the\nNational\nTerritory,\nunder\nthe\nadministrative\nresponsibility of the Institute for Biodiversity and\nProtected Areas (lBAP). Two thirds of the protected\nsurface correspond to marine or estuarine spaces.\nMarine Protected Areas and regulated fishing zones\nare at the centre of concerns of IBAP and other\ninstitutions in the subregion, grouped under a\nRegional\nCoastal\nand\nMarine\nConservation\nPartnership in West Africa (PRCM). These areas play\na central role in the reproduction and regeneration\nof fish, shrimp and shellfish stocks, ensuring the\nsustainability of the exploitation of these strategic\nresources.\n\nProtected Area -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\nTwo programmes are being used to start the\nconstruction of key and lasting structures, at the\nlevel\nof\nbiodiversity\nin\nGuinea-Bissau:\nThe\nFramework Law on Protected Areas and the\nstrengthening of the Institute of Biodiversity and\nProtected areas (IBAP) under the supervision of the\nSecretariat of State of Environment and Biodiversity\n(SEAB) and the BioGuinea Foundation, which will\ncomplement the current financing model for the\ncontinuation\nof\nfinancial\nsupport\nthrough\nsustainable financial flows. IBAP is responsible for\nthe management of the National System of\n\n 51| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nProtected Areas (SNAP) and the implementation of\nthe country's biodiversity protection policy.\nThe entire set of protected areas and their\nrespective range of influence covers a significant\npart of the territory (26,34%), containing the most\nimportant and more relevant countries forest and\nmangrove forest spots.\n\nProtected Area -\nhttps://ibapgbissau.org/Home/Galeria?Length=4\nThe mitigation action involves the effective\nmanagement and implementation of regulations\non APs to improve biomass volumes and including\nthe upgrading of deforestation and carbon\nemission baselines and field data collection for\nmonitoring in two Protected areas: Cacheu and\nCantanhez through the National System of\nProtected Areas (SNAP) this implies that the benefit\nof the carbon increment would be harvested\nthrough increases in biomass above the soil and in\nthe soil carbon densities. The Annual Carbon\nIncrement (IAC) has not yet been estimated, but the\nassumption is that above-ground biomass and soil\ncarbon densities would increase annually and\nwould be considered as potential carbon reduction\nresulting from the direct Forest protection or\nconservation action. As regards this issue and the\nadditional mitigation measures undertaken by the\nGovernment of Guinea-Bissau in this sector, it is\nworth highlighting the following key milestones:\n\nForestry sector\nThe\ncreation\nof\nprotected\nareas\nfor\nthe\nconservation\nand\nmanagement\nof\nnatural\nresources, one of the largest achievements in the\ncountry that currently correspond 26.34%. Other\nkey and relevant measures for Mitigation include:\n• In spite of all deficiencies in combating illegal\ntimber extraction and forest degradation, the\ngovernment of Guinea-Bissau signed the United\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification,\nwhich led to the creation of the Action Plan to fight\nDrought and Desertification in order to develop\nstrategies and actions to combat the phenomena of\ndesertification in the country;\n• The development of the National Forest Action\nPlan in the years 90 at the legislative level;\n• The recent launch of the Community Forestry\nManagement initiative using integrated land\n\nmanagement approaches in the Tabancas (small\nvillages) (GITT);\n• The approval of the new forestry law,\nencouraging\nthe\ncreation\nof\ncommunity\nmanagement forests at the level of the DirectorateGeneral for Forest management;\n• As described in above, the current extension\nprocess of protected areas, at national level, with\nthe specific inclusion of the forests of Dulombi Boé\nand the respective corridors that interconnect, still\nin progress.\nIn short, this sector lacks the establishment and\nscheduling of a new forestry policy. The vision is a\nsustainable management of forest resourcesincluding through the conservation and restoration\nof forests-to improve a socioeconomic balance that\nmeets the needs of communities and guarantees\ntheir responsibility;\n\nLivestock sector\nLivestock products account for about 30% of agricultural GDP. Despite the importance of livestock farming\nin the economic, socio-cultural and nutritional level, the public investment portion planned for this\nsubsector remained relatively low and steadily decreasing in the last 30 years. However, the Government\nhas taken some measures that contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change. This includes:\n• The outline of the Charter of Livestock Development Policy, which provides, among others, pastoral\nvocational areas and the conception of water withholding structures;\n• The development of studies to support the development of production of short-cycle animals ensured\nmainly by women who can also decrease the CH4 emission of enteric fermentation.\n\n 52| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\n\n3.4.2 Mitigation measures in the Energy\nsector\nThe widespread absence of basic infrastructure is,\nfor many years, one of the most serious restrictions\nwith which the national economy is confronted. The\nconsumption of electricity in Guinea-Bissau is one\nof\nthe\nlowest\nin\nthe\nworld:\nabout\n0.3\ntoe/person/year, and only 40% of the inhabitants of\nthe capital, Bissau, have access to electricity\ncompared to 20% of rural areas (PRSP II, 2011). In\ngeneral, GHG emissions in the residential subsector\nare extremely dependent, on the pace of\npopulation growth and the number of households\non the one hand, and on the other hand in the\nelectrification rate, which usually determine the\nlevel of the emission category. Therefore, the\nprojected growth in emissions of this sector\ncorresponds to the energy demands of urban\nhouseholds, followed by the emissions of rural\nhouseholds and the use of energy in transportation\n(land, sea and air). In Guinea-Bissau, stoves for\ncooking fed on wood and coal constitute the largest\nsource of emission, thus becoming a priority area of\nmitigation.\nThe general objectives of the Government's\napproach to the implementation of prioritized\nmitigation measures are to ensure the continuous\nreduction of GHG emissions while safeguarding\nsustainable growth and development. At this stage,\nthe implementation of these actions is through:\ni) integration of these mitigation objectives into\nnational,\ndistrict\nand\nsectoral\nplans\nand\nprogrammes;\nii) promotion of specific and personalized actions,\ninvolving the mobilization of adequate resources\nfrom international sources; and\nIII) facilitating the implementation of specific actions\nin the subcategories of energy production and\nconsumption, domestic energy and renewable\nenergy; and\nIV) conducting studies on the energy potential of\nthe country and defining the energy development\nby incorporating the greatest possible potential of\nrenewable energies in the energy mix;\n\nEnergy production and consumption\n• The recent approval of the Energy sector\nDevelopment Policy Charter;\n• The formulation of the National Policy for the\nPromotion of Renewable Energy (wind, solar,\nbiomass);\n• The implementation of programs financed by the\nCILSS and the World Environmental Fund, UNDP,\nwhich allowed the installation of small-scale solar\npanels to provide electrical energy and collective\nneeds of the country (basic health centers, Schools\nand telecommunications);\n• The ongoing construction of a new power plant\nto replace the current plant of Bissau, which does\nnot\ncomply\nwith\nenvironmental\nregulations,\nparticularly in terms of GHG emissions;\n• Completion of the energy master plan to support\nthe restoration and promotion of the electricity\nproduction system financed by the World Bank and\nthe EU.\n\nDomestic energy\nWood fuel (firewood and charcoal) provides\napproximately 90% of the energy consumed in the\ncountry. Currently, the country's forest formations\nsuffer strong pressure due to increasing population\ndemand and growth, especially in rural areas, which\nare heavily dependent on traditional energy (8595% of the population uses coal and wood for\ncooking). The following steps have been taken so\nfar, by the GoGB, to mitigate the GHG release\nassociated with the production of wood fuel:\nFirewood\n• In this context, national authorities, NGOs and\nbasic associations have undertaken various actions,\nsuch as monitoring, dissemination of improved\nstoves and braziers, improvement of carbonization\ntechniques and promotion of other types of fuel,\nsuch as butane gas, solar energy, etc.;\n\n• The Government also integrated its internal\nEnergy Policy into the NEPAD Energy Strategy,\nwhich could substantially improve the achievement\nof domestic targets for reducing energy scarcity.\n\n 53| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\nRenewable energy\nRenewable energies (water, solar, wind, biomass)\nare potential sources for Guinea-Bissau, since the\nresources are abundant. In this sector, the following\nsteps were undertaken to mitigate the GHG release:\n• Three biomass-based energy production pilot\nunits were built with the support of UEMOA (Union\nEconomique and Monétaire Ouest Africaine);\n• The\nCharter\nof\nthe\nNational\nEnergy\ndevelopment Policy, now in force, was drafted in\n2007 to (i) accelerate rural electrification by means\nof local initiatives; and (ii) prepare the guidelines for\nthe wood fuel supply scheme;\n• Organization of the Investment Program in the\nconstruction of the hydroelectric dam under the\nenergy project of the Gambia River Basin\nOrganization (OMVG) in West Africa;\n• Three rural electrification projects based on\nsolar energy and biofuels financed through the\nEnergy facility II (European Union) mechanism;\n• The planned development of two hydroelectric\npower plants identified so far: dams of Saltinho\n(14MW) and Cussilintra (13MW);\n\nBambadinca Solar Plant - Guinea Bissau\nhttp://suniaenergy.com/trabajos/central-solar-de-bambadincaguinea-bissau/\n\n3.4.3 Mitigation measures in the Waste sector\nIn the solid waste category, the growing trend in emissions is closely linked to population growth,\nurbanization rate and population living standards. With a national population projected in Guinea-Bissau\nto be well above the 3 million in 2050 and with a per capita waste production of 0.32 kg/day, the total\nannual solid waste should reach more than 1 million tons per year. Therefore, the management of such\ngenerated waste volumes represents a major logistical problem and challenges the municipal financial\ncapacity to solve the waste problem.\n\nThe main problem currently faced by urban centers\nin the main cities of Guinea-Bissau is the project of\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects for\nthe construction of controlled dumps and sanitary\nlandfills. Therefore, the Government should soon be\nable to complement the current efforts to build\nlandfills with exploiting the recycling potential and\nderive energy production from waste. Waste\nrecycling is a process of emission reductions,\ncontributing to the development of agriculture, the\nproduction of electricity from biogas and fuel\nbriquettes for cooking. In fact, local communities\nthat are already aware of waste-related problems\ndo\nnot\nreadily\naccept\nthe\ncreation\nof\ndumps/landfills in their respective communities.\nThus, the degree of awareness of open-pit waste\nhelps them to play a very important role in the\nacceptance or not of the development of the\nproject.\n\nCurrently the technology used in Guinea-Bissau for\nthe treatment of waste is rudimentary and restricted\nto the burning of open-air debris, with the emission\nof CO2, CO, N2O into the atmosphere. Therefore,\nthere is a great need to implement sophisticated\ncomposting and incineration technologies, if\npossible, depending on the cost-benefit analysis\nand also the involvement of the private sector.\n\n3.5 Mitigation Scenario\nA mitigation scenario reveals a future in which explicit policies and measures are adopted to reduce the\nsources (or increase the sinks) of the GHGs. These measures can be carried out as a way of having the\nprojects to be implemented in a specific sector or subsector of GHG.\n\n 54| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\n3.5.1 Projects in the mitigation scenario\n\"Business as Usual\" (BAU) is the base scenario for\nGHG emissions considered for the evaluation of\nprojections of elected categories of GHG emission\nsources. This scenario assumes the continuation of\ngeneral practices and relations at national level. The\nestimates of GHG projections were, therefore,\nobtained from the evolution of the variables usually\nresponsible for emissions or removals. The fuel\ndemands to meet future energy needs, projected\nnumber of vehicles, expected changes in land use,\nforest\nmanagement\nand\namount\nof\nwaste\ngenerated are some of these variables considered.\nOther factors that could potentially affect the\nunderlying stability in the evolution of GHG\nemissions and removals are the socio-economic\ndynamics. The projections in the basic scenario\n(BAU) for industrial production are associated with\nthe growth of GDP, since it is such a dynamic sector,\nwith new industries initiating operations and others\nclosing as the country advances. The list of projects\nthat Guinea-Bissau proposed during the initial\ncommunication is presented below (Table 3.1).\nAmong them, there are several mitigation projects\nthat still require funding to be implemented and\ncontribute to a potential reduction of GHG\nemissions. Based on this valuation of GHG\nemissions and projections of this inventory, it is\nnecessary a renewed cost and prioritization of\nmitigation projects and evaluation of the reduction\nor potential improvement of GHG during the years\n2020, 2030 and 2050.\n\nTable 3.1 – List of projects that Guinea-Bissau proposed during the initial communication.\nOrder of\npriorities\nProject designation\nGeographic area of intervention\n1\nProject\nsupporting\nthe\ndiversification\nof\nproduction and diet (Quinara and Tombali\nregions)\nSouthern Province (Quinara and Tombali regions)\n2\nRural Drinking Water Supply Improvement\nProject\nSouthern Province (Quinara and Tombali regions) Eastern\nProvince (Bafata and Gabu regions)\n3\nProject for strengthening the Capacity for\nProtection of Mangrove rice fields against high\ntide Water Invasion\nSouthern Province (Tombali and Quinara Bolama/Bijagós\nregion) Northern Province (Cacheu region)\n4\nClimate Change Impact Assessment Project for\nProducing Sectors\nNorthern Province (Cacheu) region South Province\n(Bolama region/Bijagós)\n5\nCoastal Zone Erosion Monitoring Project\nProvince of the north (Cacheu) Province of the South\n(Bolama region/Bijagós)\n6\nEvaluation of the impact of climate change on\nthe project sectors of producers\nThroughout the national territory\n7\nSmall-scale Irrigation development Project over\nGeba and Corubal River Banks\nEast Province (Bafata and Gabu province) Northern\nProvince (Oio region)\n8\nNatural Disaster Prevention Project\nThroughout the national territory\n\n9\nFisheries and Coastal Resources Protection,\nConservation and Valorization Project\nCoastal Zone (North and South Province)\n10\nIntegrated Food Safety Information System\n(SISA) Project\nThroughout the national territory\n11\nCoastal\nEnvironmental\nEducation\nand\nCommunication Project\nCoastal Zone (North and South Province)\n12\nProject for Rehabilitation of Mangrove plots for\nrice growing in Tombali, Quínara, Bafatá and Oio\nEast Province (Bafatá region) Northern Province (Oio\nregion) Southern Province (Quinara and Tombali)\n13\nShort Cycle Animal Production Support Project\nEast Province (Bafatá region) Northern Province (Oio\nregion) Southern Province (regions of Quinara and\nTombali)\n14\nProject for Reforestation of Degraded Areas\nEastern Province (Bafatá region)\n\n 55| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 3: Mitigation Actions\n\n3.6 State of Implementation of Mitigation Actions and their Effects in GuineaBissau\n\n3.6.1 Consumption pattern in the Energy Sector\nAccording to UNIDO (2017), Guinea‑Bissau is confronted with serious energy supply problems, which are\nmainly occurring due to the need for importation of petroleum products to meet the demand of the\ntransport, industry, part of mechanized agriculture and the residential sector (lighting oil and liquefied\npetroleum gas) and the excessive exploitation of biomass resources. The importation of petroleum\nproducts accounts for about 8% of the nominal GDP and 12% of the actual GDP and the depletion of the\nsupply resources of the biomass amounts to about 82% of the total consumption of the country. In 2012,\nthe final energy consumption increased by 23% compared to 2010, reaching 4,941.63 GWh (Table 3.2).\n\nTable 3.2 – Final energy consumption by sector and by category (Adapted from UNIDO, 2017).\n\nAs shown before in the emission section, the\nresidential sector continued to be the sector that\nrecorded the highest consumption, and responsible\nfor almost all consumption in 2012 (83%) and in\n2010 (94.8%). Firewood was the preferred form of\nenergy used. This sector is followed by the tertiary\nsector (6.8%), by transport (4.9%) and the industrial\nsector (3.6%). Thus, the energy needs of the\nresidential sector were ensured in its entirety by the\nconsumption\nof\nfirewood.\nHence,\nfirewood\n(3,704.00 GWh) and charcoal (720.51 GWh) were the\nforms of energy most in demand in 2012, followed\nby petroleum products (484.46 GWh), electricity\n(27.49 GWh) and others (5.17 GWh). Petroleum\nproducts are the energy form most used in the\npublic electricity production of and transport\nsectors.\n\nAccording to UNIDO, electricity demand in 2010\nwas about 141 GWh, with the residential sector\naccounting for about 56% of this. Between 2010 and\n2013, electricity demand increased at an average\nannual rate of about 3.2%, reaching 182 GWh in\n2013, and although the residential sector remains\nresponsible for a large part of the demand, other\nsectors were responsible for the increase.\n\nElectricity demand is expected to increase to 546\nGWh by 2030 - which was estimated on the basis of\nlast years' supply as well as the recorded output.\nThus, there is an urgent need for mitigation actions\ntargeted at the residential sector, particularly for\nprojects leading to a decrease in the use of\nfirewood and charcoal as sources of domestic\nenergy\n\n3.6.1 Mitigation Actions in the Energy\nSector\nBased on the BUR guidelines and as described in\nDecision 2 / CP.17, Annex III, Section IV information\non mitigation actions and their effects will be\nreported here, as far as possible.

Thus,\nin the framework of the application of this Article 4 in conjunction with Article 12 - Decisions 10 / CP2 and\n17 / CP8, the country is required to periodically submit its National Communications (NCs) by providing\ninformation through GHG inventories (emissions and absorption sources), vulnerability assessment and\nclimate change adaptation measures, emission mitigation or mitigation options, among others. UNFCCC\nDecisions 1 / CP.16 and 2 / CP.17 urge Non-Annex I Parties to submit their Biennial Update Reports (BUR)\nto provide an update on the data and information contained in the most recent CNs on adjustments related\nto climate change. The Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report (BUR 1) aims, on the one hand, to\nstrengthen national technical and institutional capacities for the preparation of national circumstances and\nBiennial Update and, on the other hand, to update the data and information contained in recent NCs, in\nparticular those related to national circumstances and institutional arrangements, Greenhouse Gas (GHG)\ninventories, constraints, gaps and needs related to technical and financial capacities, support received and\nall Monitoring information, Reporting and Verification (MRV).\nUrok Community Protected Marine Area - , Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau\n\n 70| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 4: Financial, Technology, Capacity Needs and Support\nReceived\nThis Chapter intends to report the results on\nidentified constraints and gaps, financial, technical\nand capacity-building needs and to describe the\nsupport received for the implementation of Climate\nChange-related Activities / Projects / Programs,\nincluding the preparation and presentation of this\nBUR 1.

The country has not yet\nestimated the cost-benefit of climate change (costeffectiveness\nof\nadaptation,\nmitigation\nand\ntechnology transfer). Regarding adaptation, the\n\n 81| Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 4: Financial, Technology, Capacity Needs and Support\nReceived\nProject “Strengthening Resilience and Adaptability\nof the Agrarian and Water Sector Climate Change\nin Guinea-Bissau” carried out the cost-benefit\nanalysis of adaptation in the Gabu region,\nconsidering the reference development trend. In\nthis context it has been shown that Guinea-Bissau is\nnot in itself able to financially support climate\nchange adaptation efforts. Initiatives that may exist\nwill most likely be through international programs\nand the efforts of some NGOs. Alternatively, the\ncountry should strengthen its capacity at national\nand local levels to plan and implement measures to\nincrease\nthe\nresilience\nof\nits\ncommunities,\nequipment and ecosystems to climate change. This\nwill be done within the framework of a climate\nchange\nresilience\nprogram,\nintegrated\ninto\nmultisectoral rural development and based on upto-date and accurate data and forecasts.\nAt national level, government agencies should\nassume a coherent leadership role within a strong\nlegislative and policy framework. The national\ngovernment should make an additional effort to\neffectively allocate human and financial resources\nto overall environmental management for climate\nresilience. The national government should be able\nto use greater capacity to absorb and attract new\nand\nadditional\nclimate-related\ninternational\nfunding. National administrative and technical\nagencies,\nin\npartnership\nwith\ninternational\ncooperation\nagencies\nand\ncivil\nsociety\norganizations, can provide timely and accurate\ntechnical support to local governments and\ncommunities. This will be based on enough\nunderstanding of climate change, climate variability\nand its implications through a prioritization process.\n\nAt local level, communities should identify and\nprioritize measures and undertake programs and\nprojects that incorporate captivities into their\nlivelihoods; activities that reduce their vulnerability,\nin particular as regards climate change and climate\nvariability.

Measurement is needed to identify emissions trends, determine\nwhere to focus greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts, track mitigation-related support, assess whether\nmitigation actions planned under NDCs or otherwise are proving effective, evaluate the impact of support\nreceived, and monitor progress achieved in reducing emissions. Reporting and verification are important\nfor ensuring transparency, good governance, accountability, and credibility of results, and for building\nconfidence that resources are being utilized effectively.\nPecixe Island – Guinea Bissau\nhttps://kalmasoul.com/kalma-blog/pecixe-um-paraiso-remoto/\n\n86 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\n\n5.2 MRV Concepts and Definitions\nMany countries have engaged in MRV to serve a\nvariety of domestic and international purposes. This\nterm is widely used in the climate change field, but\noften without a clear reference to the type of MRV\nbeing discussed. This often leads to confusion\nbecause the underlying nature of MRV-related\nactivities differs according to their context and\napplication (Singh, N., J et al., 2016).\n\nBOX 1 | Measurement, Reporting, and Verification of\nNationally (MRV) Determined Contributions - Concept and\nDefinitions\n\nThe term MRV first appeared in the context of\nclimate change mitigation policy as part of the Bali\nAction Plan (2007), which called for “measurable,\nreportable, and verifiable nationally appropriate\nmitigation commitments or actions” and stated that\nthey should be “supported and enabled by\ntechnology, financing and capacity-building, in a\nmeasurable, reportable and verifiable manner”\n(UNFCCC 2007). Subsequently, efforts have been\nmade to fill in the details and define what should be\nmeasured, reported, and verified, how, by whom,\nand for what purpose. Most recently, under the\nParis Agreement, it was agreed that all countries will\nprovide emissions data and track progress against\ntheir contributions. MRV systems will be a\nsignificant component in effectively tracking and\nimproving the implementation of mitigation goals\nand policies articulated under countries’ Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (NDCs) (CDKN Global\n2016).\n\n5.2.1 MRV in Guinea-Bissau\nEven before the term MRV emerged under the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC), some form of monitoring and\nevaluation (M&E) was routinely been used by\ngovernment institutions and other agencies to\naccurately and transparently assess their actions\nand goals within the government legislation\nframework. However, in the context of GHG the\nprocess of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) follows\na given classification and depends on objective\n(emission, mitigation actions or support) so that the\nM&E for mitigation can be named MRV (see Box 1\nfor details) and categorized into three types (Pang\net al. 2014) (Figure 1).\n\nMRV of GHG emissions refers to estimating,\nreporting, and verifying actual emissions over a\ndefined period of time. This type of MRV can be\nperformed at national level, or by organizations and\nfacilities. For example, national GHG inventories\ninclude an account of emissions from a country for\na particular period, are reported to UNFCCC, and\nundergo some form of review.\nMRV of mitigation actions involves assessing (ex-\nante or ex-post) GHG emissions reductions and/or\nsustainable development (non-GHG) effects of\npolicies, projects, and actions, as well as monitoring\ntheir implementation progress. It also involves\nassessing progress toward mitigation goals. An\nexample would be a national government\nestimating the GHG and job growth-related\nimpacts of its home insulation subsidy program.\nWhile MRV of GHG emissions measures actual\nemissions, MRV of mitigation actions estimates the\nchange in emissions and other non-GHG variables\nthat results from those actions.\nMRV of support focuses on monitoring the\nprovision and receipt of financial flows, technical\n\n87 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\n\nknowledge, and capacity building, and evaluating\nthe results and impact of support. An example of\nthis kind of MRV would be developing countries\ntracking climate- specific finance received through\nbilateral or multi- lateral channels.\n\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau, through its\nvarious\ninstitutions\nand\nagencies,\nregularly\nconducts surveys and censuses to complement\nusual data collection, especially in areas covered by\nregular organizational activities. This type of\nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) is usually\nperformed according to the resources and skills\navailable to the government and its institutions,\ntaking into account the financial, technical and\ntechnological aspects, including availability of\nfunds, level of knowledge, appropriate staffing and\ntechnologies such as the necessary hardware and\nsoftware. Unfortunately, data for compiling GHG\ninventories is not traditionally part of the\ngovernment's M&E system and that is why such\nM&E processes, that is MRV have not yet been fully\ninstalled to establish systematic procedures for the\nperiodic compilation of GHG inventories. However,\ndespite these constraints, the country adhered to\nthe international agenda and Guinea-Bissau signed\nand ratified the UNFCCC, thus becoming a\ncontracting party\n.\n\nFigure 5.1 – The MRV categories of mitigation into three types. Adapted from: Singh, N., J et al., 2016\n\n5.3 Information on Domestic MRV\n5.3.1 Development of MRV in Guinea-Bissau\nAccording to the past GHG inventories (2006), the main GHG emission sectors identified were: (i) Land Use\nChange and forest use; (ii) Energy and (iii) Waste. In order to adopt the country's emission reduction\nstrategy, the UNDP financed in 2011 a consultation work aimed at identifying barriers, gaps and capacity\nneeds at the level of Institutional, human and systemic for a successful formulation of development Strategy\nfor Low Carbon Emission (LEDS), NAMAS and MRV system. The identified gaps and barriers regarding the\nimplementation of the MRV, LEDS and NAMAS initiatives in the country were at five levels: human\nresources, material, technical, financial and institutionally in which a coordinate structure is required.\n\nAt the human resources level\nThe following points stand out:\n• Poor development of climate change education,\ntraining and research, in particular as regards\nvulnerability,\nadaptation\n/\nmitigation\nand\ntechnology transfer;\n• Lack\nof\nmastery\nof\ninstruments\nand\nmethodologies for inventorying GHG, adequately\nassessing",
