In the same year, the sector’s GHG\nemissions accounted for 35,411.9 ktCO2eq., increasing by 6.4 % since 1990, mainly due to the increase in the country’s energy consumption, which includes the consumption of diesel and natural\ngas for electricity generation, as well as the consumption of liquid\nfuels for land transportation, mostly diesel and gasoline.\nIn 2016, the IPPU sector accounted for emissions of 776.3 ktCO2eq., representing only 1.6 % of the country’s total emissions\nexcluding FOLU, 73.6 % less than 1990, as it was the sector most\naffected by the economic crisis that the country endured in early\n1990s, and has not yet recovered, which is evident throughout the\nseries.\nThe AFOLU sector is the second most important as regards\nemissions in the country. It is also the only sector that acts as a\nCO2 sink. In 2016, it represented 20.1 % of GHG emissions in the\ncountry. In the same year, the balance of GHG emissions in the\nsector was negative, which shows that removals from forestry activities were higher than emissions from agricultural activities. The\ntotal resulting from the AFOLU sector accounted for an absolute\nremoval of 17,037.8 ktCO2eq., increasing by 1,431 % since 1990. This\n\n45\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsignificant increase is mainly due to the increase in the country’s\nforest areas since the beginning of the analyzed period, which has\nmaintained a marked increment throughout the series, increasing\nthe removal of emissions by 67.2 % since 1990.\nThe Wastes sector accounted for 7.8 % of total GHG emissions\n(excluding FOLU) in 2016. In the same year, the sector’s GHG\nemissions accounted for 3,916 ktCO2eq., increasing by 24.8 % since\n1990. The main cause is attributed to the sustained increase in the\ngeneration of solid wastes and their final disposal in uncategorized\nlandfills.\nMitigation actions\nPrioritized sectors for mitigation\nactions\nEnergy, AFOLU\nMain characteristics of mitigation\nactions\nA systemic process of identification and follow-up of mitigation\nactions began, in a more harmonized manner and with monitoring\nby the Government, from Cuba’s\nincorporation to the Paris Agreement and the implementation of\nthe Task Life.\nThe mitigation actions shown in the table below have been identified and are in different statuses of design and implementation.\nNone of them is still under an MRV system. The establishment of\nsuch a system for mitigation actions is one of the priorities included in the document General Bases for the establishment of an\nMRV System in Cuba. The country’s approach to establishing a\nreinforced transparency system under the Paris Agreement is expanded in point 4.1 of this Report.\nFor the implementation of the outlined mitigation strategy, it\nis necessary to overcome a set of important barriers, among which\nstand out:\n• Incorporation of the mitigation dimension into the strategies,\nplans and projects of the sectors and territories;\n• Design of new mechanisms and incentives for the implementation of mitigation actions;\n• Lack of personnel with sufficient training in the subject of cli-\n\n46\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nmate change, and specifically in mitigation, in the different\nsectors, territories and development projects where the mitigation dimension should be taken into account;\n• Information gathering systems designed for other purposes\nthat are inappropriate for mitigation purposes;\n• Lack of financing for the implementation of mitigation actions;\n• Difficulties in accessing the most appropriate technologies to\nface climate change, due to the regulations related to the US\nblockade against Cuba.\n• The implementation of the Life Task has achieved multisectoral and territorial approaches; however, there is still insufficient connection among sectors and between these and the\nterritories.\n• Insufficient systematization, in correspondence with the new\nrequirements of the reinforced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement, of the methodological, data and calculation basis for ex-ante evaluations, systematic monitoring\nand ex-post evaluations. For example: methodologies adopted for the determination of baselines, emission reduction\npotentials, national emission factors, among others.\n• Lack of national emission factors that more truly reflect the\ncharacteristics of fuels, technologies, processes and activities\nin the domestic context.\n• Lack of MRV systems required for the sectors, actions and\nprojects with the greatest impact on mitigation.\n\nMitigation\naction\nSector / Scope\nObjective /\nActions\nStatus\nBase year (base\nvalue) / target\nyear (target value)\nObtained Results\nImprovement\nActions\n1.

It is estimated that, if the necessary support were received, the country\nwould have a basically Enhanced Transparency Framework implemented in 2025.\nThe report presents the general Governance scheme of the\nMRV system, which will be legalized once the Decree for Confronting Climate Change is passed. Its draft is in the approval phase\nand recognizes the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (CITMA) as the body responsible for the general coordination of the transparency framework, to ensure compliance with\nthe international commitments assumed by the country related\nto the subject. In relation to mitigation and the transparency framework, the rest of the Agencies of the Central State Administration (OACE) are assigned, among others, specific functions related\nto the assessment and incorporation of the GHG mitigation dimension into their programs, plans and investment projects; as\nwell as the identification and contribution of the information required to control GHG emissions, as a tool to plan future actions\nand establish the necessary procedures to control and report these\nactions; and the management and use of available international financial resources, both from global and regional climate funds, as\nwell as from bilateral sources, to execute the investments, projects\nand actions that fulfill the priorities for tackling climate change.\nThe National Office of Statistics and Information, together\nwith the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment,\nis entrusted with the establishment of the bases of an information\nsystem for climate change that allows capturing the necessary information to fulfill the commitments assumed by Cuba, with the\nparticipation of the agencies of the Central State Administration,\nnational entities, Administration Councils, Higher Organization of\nBusiness Management, as well as any state or private entity, which\nare under the obligation to provide information directly related to\nclimate change.\nThe BUR presents the progress of the MRV system for the inventory, its objectives, governance, institutional arrangements, the flow\nof processes to develop the GHG Inventory, the phases/stages and\ntasks to be carried out in each phase of the inventory cycle, as well\nas its coordinators, participants and main verification indicators.\n\n52\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nSimilarly, for the MRV system of mitigation actions, the report\nshows its objectives, the mitigation measures to which the MRV\nsystem is applied, the governance system, requirements and form\nof presentation and registration of mitigation actions, as well as\nthe requirements and form of presentation of progress reports on\nmitigation actions.\nFinancing, technology and capacity building needs, and\nsupport received\nThe MRV subsystem for support is not designed yet in the country.

Circunstancias nacionales y\narreglos institucionales relativos a la\npreparación del Primer Informe Bienal\nde Actualización de Cuba\nEn respuesta a la decisión 2/CP17 de la CMNUCC, la República\nde Cuba como Estado Insular en Desarrollo, puede presentar a su\ndiscreción informes bienales de actualización. Cuba se ha comprometido a producir su Primer Informe Bienal de Actualización\n(IBA).\nEl primer Informe Bienal de Cuba se presenta en conjunción\ncon la Tercera Comunicación Nacional del país. Por consiguiente,\neste Capítulo ofrece una visión muy sintética de las circunstancias\nnacionales más relevantes a la formulación del presente Informe.\nEn ese sentido, se muestra una panorámica básica de la caracterización general del archipiélago cubano, estructura y condiciones\neconómicas actuales, la situación de sus principales recursos naturales y se amplía en la consideración de los principales sectores\neconómicos con mayor influencia en las emisiones y remociones\nde GEI y en las acciones de mitigación, al tiempo que se apuntan\nsus capacidades y limitaciones para lograr una mitigación efectiva\ndel cambio climático.\nFinalmente, se describen los arreglos institucionales bajo los\ncuales se formuló este Informe.\nEste capítulo ofrece una caracterización general del archipiélago cubano, de su estructura y condiciones económicas actuales, el\nestado del medio ambiente nacional, la situación de sus principales recursos naturales y de los principales sectores económicos con\nmayor influencia en las emisiones y remociones de GEI y en las acciones de mitigación. Además, se evidencian sus capacidades y limitaciones para lograr una mitigación efectiva del cambio climático.\n1.1 Perfil físico-geográfico\nLa República de Cuba se localiza en el llamado Mediterráneo\nAmericano, entre los 19° 49’ y 23° 16’ de latitud norte, y los 74° 08’\ny 84° 57’ de longitud oeste (ONEI, 2018). Los límites geográficos se\npueden observar en la Figura 1.1.\n\n56\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 1.1 Límites geográficos del archipiélago cubano.\nEl archipiélago cubano está formado por la isla de Cuba, la Isla de\nla Juventud y más de 1,600 islas, islotes y cayos. Cuenta con una\nsuperficie total de 109,884 km2 (Tabla 1.1), convirtiéndolo en el Estado más extenso del Caribe insular y uno de los mayores de toda\nMesoamérica. En su conjunto, la costa norte y sur, abarcan 5,746 km\nlongitud.\nTabla 1.1 Datos de extensión superficial del archipiélago cubano5\nExtensión superficial (km2)\nIsla de Cuba\n104,338.33\nIsla de la Juventud\n2,419.27\nCayos e islotes\n3,126.41\nPlataforma insular\n67,832\nDesde el punto de vista político-administrativo, Cuba se divide en\n15 provincias y 168 municipios, incluyendo al Municipio Especial\nde la Isla de la Juventud; y atendiendo a las características geoeconómicas se reconocen tres regiones: Occidente, Centro y Oriente.\nExisten 117.6 km2, con 17.5 km de costa, usurpados y ocupados ilegalmente por los Estados Unidos de América, donde mantienen,\nen contra de la voluntad del pueblo y Gobiernos de Cuba, una base\nnaval. Cuba no es responsable de las acciones nocivas al medio\nambiente y al clima que en ese lugar se generan.\n5 Anuario Cuba 2018\n\n57\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nCon una longitud de 1,250 km su parte más ancha alcanza 191 km,\nmientras que la más angosta es de solo 31 km. Esta configuración,\njunto con su orientación de este a oeste, no permite la existencia\nde ríos largos y caudalosos (el 85 % con extensión inferior a 40 km),\nlos que en su mayoría presentan cuencas pequeñas (menores de\n200 km2), cursos cortos de poco caudal, con una evacuación rápida\nde las avenidas al mar. Los recursos hídricos superficiales y subterráneos son limitados, mientras que las cuencas subterráneas están\nvinculadas a un fuerte desarrollo cársico y se destinan a satisfacer\nlas principales demandas de agua, de la producción y la población.\nLa insularidad del territorio cubano y la morfología de sus costas cubiertas en un 70 % por manglares, 20 % por costas arenosas o\nplayas y un 10 % de costas rocosas o acantilados, aumenta la vulnerabilidad ante los posibles impactos del cambio climático. La gran\nextensión del litoral cubierta por zonas bajas e inundables hace\nque la vulnerabilidad al impacto del incremento del nivel del mar\nsea muy alta. En este sentido, la protección que brindan los ecosistemas marinos y costeros sanos, sobre todo los manglares, que\nademás de cubrir el 70 % del litoral de la isla principal conforman la\nmayor parte de los 4,000 cayos e islotes que bordean los extremos\nde la plataforma insular cubana, es esencial para el sostenimiento\nde las actividades socioeconómicas del país, al propio tiempo estas formaciones de manglar y otros ecosistemas costeros, pueden\nofrecer co beneficios de mitigación, todo lo cual se encuentra hoy\nbajo estudio.\n1.2 Perfil climático\nEl clima se caracteriza por ser cálido tropical con estación lluviosa en el verano, aunque es bastante aceptado expresar que el\nclima de Cuba es tropical, estacionalmente húmedo, con influencia marítima y rasgos de semicontinentalidad. Como factores determinantes en su formación se encuentran: la radiación solar,\nla circulación atmosférica, y las características físico-geográficas\npropias del territorio.\nLos ciclones tropicales y las tormentas locales severas (tornados, granizadas, trombas marinas y vientos lineales superiores a\n90 km/h) son los fenómenos meteorológicos a los que se asocia\nel mayor peligro de desastre, y son responsables de algunos de los\nextremos climáticos observados. La temporada ciclónica va del\n1 de junio al 30 de noviembre, en la cual el bimestre septiembre\n\n58\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n- octubre resulta el de mayor afectación, con el mayor reporte de\nhuracanes intensos.\nCuba es signataria y aplica los acuerdos internacionales para la\nreducción de desastres en el marco de SENDAI.\n1.3 Población, salud, educación. Índice\nde Desarrollo Humano\nEn diciembre 2017, la población cubana había llegado a 11.2 millones de habitantes, con un equilibrio entre los sexos (unos 991\nhombres por cada 1,000 mujeres); el 77 % del total de habitantes del\npaís vivían en zonas urbanas.\nCuba se ubica entre los países más envejecidos de América Latina y el Caribe, y dentro de dos o tres décadas pasará a ocupar el\nprimer lugar. Esta situación está influida por una tasa global de\nfecundidad, francamente descendente que al cierre de 2017 era de\n1.6, a la vez que la eficiencia de los sistemas de salud incrementó\nla esperanza de vida a 78.45 años en 2018. Esto se resume en una\nreducción de la población entre 0 y 14 años, el estancamiento de la\npoblación entre 15 y 59 años y el crecimiento de la población mayor de 60 años, que en 2017 llegó a ser el 20 % de la población total.\nA partir de la proyección 2015-2050 habrá alrededor de 1.4 millones de personas mayores de 60 años más que en 2015, mientras\nque la población entre 15 y 59 años se habrá contraído en 0.7 millones de personas en ese mismo intervalo. Ello constituye un reto\npara la sociedad cubana y su desarrollo, y demanda atención priorizada, así como la elaboración de políticas y programas acorde a\nla reducción de la población en edades laborales proyectada y la\natención a las especificidades de la población envejecida.\nEl comportamiento de la migración general en Cuba se muestra en la Figura 1.2.\nEl sistema de asentamientos humanos (SAH) en Cuba está conformado por un total de 7014 asentamientos (ONEI, 2014), de los\ncuales 6,417 son rurales y 597 urbanos. Al cierre del año 2012 residían en ellos 10.6 millones de personas de forma concentrada,\nmientras que otros 569.9 miles lo hacían de manera dispersa.\n\n59\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nFigura 1.2 Tasa de migración externa (izquierda) e interna (derecha) al cierre de\n2017.\nEn Cuba se ha trabajado con indicadores proxy de salud, educación, seguridad social y otros, y más recientemente se ha obtenido\nel Índice Global de Pobreza Multidimensional (IPM), de la iniciativa de igual nombre de la Universidad de Oxford de Gran Bretaña,\nel cual se acompaña de otros indicadores y resultados de índices\ncomo el de desarrollo Humano (IDH) que de manera inclusiva\nconstatan y evidencian los resultados en la eliminación de la pobreza en Cuba y la creación de bienestar creciente con sostenibilidad para su población.6\nCuba, de forma preliminar y en fase de validación, es el segundo país en el mundo de 105 que participan en el cálculo del IPM\ncon el valor más bajo en este índice de 0.0005 y una tasa de pobreza multidimensional de 0.15 por ciento de su población para 2017.\nEn los 10 indicadores estudiados en las dimensiones de salud,\neducación y condiciones de vida, los de mortalidad infantil, acceso\na electricidad y asistencia escolar tienen los menores porcientos de\npoblación con privaciones.\nOtro indicador vinculado con la eliminación de privaciones y\nla consecuente creación de capacidades es el Índice de Desarrollo\nHumano (IDH), calculado por la oficina homónima del Programa\nde Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD).\nEl IDH es una medida resumen de los logros del promedio en\nlas principales dimensiones del desarrollo humano: una vida larga\ny saludable, estar bien informados y tener un nivel de vida digno.\nSu cálculo y evolución se considera como el criterio más impor6 Oficina Nacional de Estadística e Información (2018).

Boletín No.1 Ministerio de la Agricultura\n2016\nLas tierras agrícolas se distribuyen en cuatro categorías, identificadas del I al IV en orden descendente de agroproductividad. En este\npotencial el 76.8 % de los suelos son de categoría IV y III, estos suelos menos productivos están más presentes en la región oriental\ndel país; mientras los suelos I y II (23.2 %), de mayor agroproductividad están más presentes en las regiones occidental y central.\nLos principales factores limitantes de la agroproductividad son\nla salinización y la erosión (natural y antrópica) a los que se unen,\nla baja presencia de materia orgánica, la acidez, la compactación,\nentre otros.\n1.6 Agricultura\nEn Cuba 6 300 175 ha son tierras agrícolas, encontrándose cultivadas 2 765 212 y no cultivadas el resto que son 3 534 962 hectáreas.\nDe la superficie agrícola, están dedicadas a cultivos temporales\n1 151 131 hectáreas; a cultivos permanentes se dedican 1 454 239\nhectáreas y a la ganadería, 3 694 804 hectáreas.\nEl 79 por ciento de las tierras agrícolas es propiedad estatal, el\n14 por ciento es propiedad de Agricultores Pequeños y el 7 % es de\npropiedad cooperativa. Un total de 303 424 personas naturales poseen tierras en usufructo y 131 802 son propietarios.\n\n63\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas áreas ociosas han ido disminuyendo gradualmente a partir\nde 2008. Desde ese año hasta la fecha, se han entregado para la línea fundamental de producción de ganadería 1 200 299 hectáreas\nde tierra. De ellas, 1 71 748 hectáreas a 105 061 personas naturales,\nlo que promedia a 10.2 ha/usufructuario.\nPara producciones agrícolas, se han otorgado 624 938 hectáreas, de ellas, 433 086 a 144 962 personas naturales, lo que promedia a 3 hectáreas por usufructuario. Para la actividad forestal, se\nhan otorgado 14 826 hectáreas, de las cuales 9 793 a 1 253 personas\nnaturales, con un promedio de 7.8 hectáreas.\nEl área cultivada es de 2 765 213 ha. Se consideran áreas donde\nse practica agricultura sostenible por estar sometidas a procesos de\nmanejo sostenible de suelos un total de 1 051 000 ha, lo que equivale a 60 % del área. Para 2030 se proyecta alcanzar el 100 % de las\náreas de cultivo y con ello además de otras medidas de tipo agrotécnicas lograr rendimientos superiores. Para lograr esto, se aplica\nuna estrategia para la conservación y mejoramiento de suelos que\nincluye un diagnóstico y las acciones estratégicas.\nEntre las acciones o líneas estratégicas para alcanzar las metas\npropuestas por el país al 2030 se encuentran:\n• Incrementar hasta el 2030 en un millón de hectáreas la superficie agrícola beneficiadas por el Programa Nacional de\nMejoramiento y Conservación de Suelos con el propósito de\ngarantizar el manejo sostenible de los suelos.\n• Aumentar hasta el 2030 en un 10 % el rendimiento productivo\nen áreas beneficiadas por el Programa Nacional de Conservación y Mejoramiento de Suelos, para contribuir a la seguridad\nalimentaria.\n• Extender hasta el 2030 en 150 000 hectáreas las áreas bajo categorías de Manejo Sostenible de Tierras asegurando la productividad de los suelos con enfoque integrado y sostenible\nde los recursos naturales, para contribuir a alcanzar la soberanía alimentaria del país.\n\nLa superficie bajo riego actualmente es de 459 008 hectáreas, representando 7.4 % con relación a la superficie agrícola\n(6 240 263 hectáreas) y 17 % de la superficie cultivada, indicador por\nel cual se mide la superficie con riego en otros países. Se proyecta\npara el período 2019-2030 llegar al 30 %, que representa 1 413 000\nha más, con lo cual, los rendimientos agrícolas y ganaderos se incrementarían.\n\n64\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.7 Bosques y prácticas de gestión forestal\nLos bosques cubanos se clasifican en siete categorías, sobre la base\nde un conjunto de elementos de orden físico, biológico, ecológico\ny social 9 (Tabla 1.3).

La expansión futura de la generación del SEN se sustentará esencialmente en el incremento de las\nfuentes renovables de energía, en el fortalecimiento de la generación térmica convencional y la instalación de nuevas capacidades\nen Ciclos Combinados a gas.\nUna transformación esencial del marco legal nacional, ocurre\ncon la promulgación del Decreto-Ley no. 345, de 23 de marzo de\n2017, 15 “Del desarrollo de las fuentes renovables y el uso eficiente\nde la energía”, Este Decreto Ley tiene como objeto (Artículo 1), establecer las regulaciones para el desarrollo de las fuentes renovables y el uso eficiente de la energía, a fin de contribuir con:\na.\tLa elevación de la participación de las fuentes renovables de\nenergía en la generación de electricidad;\nb.\tla sustitución progresiva de los combustibles fósiles;\nc.\tla diversificación de la estructura de los combustibles fósiles\nempleados en la generación de energía eléctrica;\nd.\tla elevación de la eficiencia y el ahorro energéticos;\ne.\tla estimulación de la inversión, la investigación y la elevación\nde la eficiencia energética, así como la producción y utilización de energía a partir de fuentes renovables, mediante el\nestablecimiento de incentivos y demás instrumentos que estimulen su desarrollo;\nf.\tel desarrollo de la producción de equipos, medios y piezas de\nrepuesto por la industria nacional, para el aprovechamiento\nde las fuentes renovables y la eficiencia energética; y\ng.\tel establecimiento en el sector estatal de un sistema de trabajo que incluya la planificación de las tareas que posibilite el\ncumplimiento de los objetivos trazados.\n1.10 Transporte\nEn Cuba las diferentes categorías pertenecientes al subsector transporte, se caracterizan por proceder de diferentes zonas geográficas y tener un variado conjunto de técnicas de fabricación, lo que\n15 Aparecido en la Gaceta Oficial No.95, Edición Ordinaria, la Habana, 28 de noviembre de\n2019 Año cxvii.\n\n75\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nunido al envejecimiento técnico ocasionado por el prolongado\nperíodo de explotación, y al uso de tecnologías de baja eficiencia\nenergética, promueven altos niveles de emisiones de gases producto a la combustión. Esto se ve agravado por una no adecuada\ncalidad de los combustibles que se producen en el país, que específicamente para los medios de transporte automotor de carretera\nconstituye una limitante en la adquisición de tecnologías de última generación.\nEn el período se han realizado acciones de desarrollo en el\nsector transporte. Entre las principales acciones se encuentran la\nintroducción, en el modo automotor, de vehículos eléctricos e híbridos (ómnibus para el transporte público y vehículos eléctricos\nen algunas empresas de servicios) y la entrada masiva de motos\neléctricas privadas. En cuanto al sector ferroviario se tiene la materialización, en su primera etapa, del proceso inversionista relacionado con la adquisición de 240 coches de pasajeros nuevos\nprocedente de la República Popular China, a razón de 80 coches\nanuales entre el 2019 y 2021 y 70 locomotoras rusas objetivo contemplado en el Programa de Recuperación y Desarrollo del Ferrocarril (2016-2028).\nA continuación, se ofrece una panorámica sobre los diferentes\nmodos de transporte en el país.\n1.10.1 Transporte automotor\nEl transporte automotor es el principal responsable de las emisiones\ndel subsector transporte. Más del 50 % de la flota vehicular presenta\nuna situación técnica deficiente,16 debido al régimen de explotación\nexcesivo al que es sometido como consecuencia de la poca disponibilidad de vehículos, el mal estado de las vías, la carencia de piezas\nde repuestos y la no periodicidad de los mantenimientos.\nEn el año 2017, la edad promedio de todo el parque vehicular\nera de 35.2 años (Figura 1.11), siendo los más envejecidos los autos,\nlos jeeps y las camionetas. La mayor incidencia en este envejecimiento lo tienen los vehículos particulares. Los paneles, ómnibus\ny microbuses están alrededor de los 20 años de explotación. En la\nactualidad el 89 % de los vehículos automotores, son equipos tractivos17 y se encuentran en buen estado de funcionamiento.\n16 Biart H. Rafael, et al.

Fuente:\nDatos del Registro de Vehículos y elaboración propia.\n1.10.2 Transporte ferroviario\nLa transportación de pasajeros por este modo de transporte se ha\ncaracterizado por el decrecimiento continuo del parque de equipos,\nel que se encuentra en mal estado técnico por ser de segunda mano y\ntener largos años de servicio, con reparaciones diferidas, bajo Coeficiente de Disponibilidad y un elevado Índice de fallos. Esto ocasiona\natrasos en la corrida de los trenes y alteración en la circulación ferroviaria, problemática que se extiende también a los coches motores.\nEsta situación ha originado la necesidad de sustituir algunos\nservicios por ómnibus y disminuir la frecuencia de salida de los\ntrenes nacionales a cuatro días. La calidad del servicio es deficiente, así como su confort, no existiendo una logística que garantice el\nsuministro de piezas de repuesto de manera estable. La velocidad\nde circulación de los coches ha tenido que ser reducida por su mal\nestado técnico\nEn el caso de la carga las transportaciones se han visto afectadas\npor la baja disponibilidad de locomotoras de alto porte, así como alto\níndice de fallos, alta rotación de los medios de transporte, bajo coeficiente de disponibilidad técnica de los vagones e incumplimientos de\nlos plazos de descarga de casillas en los Centros de Carga y Descarga.\n\n78\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nA partir del 2016 se ha visto una revitalización en este modo de\ntransporte, fundamentalmente con la adquisición de nuevos equipos tractivos y arrastres lo que favoreció el incremento del nivel\nde actividad del sector en la transportación de pasajeros y carga\nrespectivamente. El incremento de aportación del ferrocarril en el\nmovimiento de las cargas, conllevó una sensible disminución de la\nmisma para el automotor.\n1.10.3 Transporte marítimo\nEste modo de transporte en el país está subdivido en flota auxiliar de puerto y la de cabotaje, presentando cada una las siguientes\nproblemáticas.\nFlota auxiliar de puerto\nSe cuenta con 34 remolcadores; 20 lanchas de prácticos; siete (7)\nnaves auxiliares; 12 naves de consignatarios; una (1) patana taller;\ncinco (5) grúas flotantes; una (1) patana de carga PC-400; una (1)\ndragalina; cuatro (4) lanchas limpia-bahías y una (1) patana para\nrecogida de basura. Las naves auxiliares del puerto han sido operadas por alrededor de 23 años como promedio, estando el 21 % en\nmal estado técnico o no operacional.\nEn cuanto a los remolcadores se han operado por 17 años como\npromedio. A pesar de su relativo poco tiempo de uso, el deterioro\nde los mismos es más severo que en las otras naves.\nCon relación a la mitad de la flota de combustible esta se encuentra en mal estado, no siendo así el caso de las lanchas de prácticos que están en buenas condiciones.\nFlota de cabotaje\nSe cuenta con seis (6) buques RO-RO, 12 patanas, 10 de ellas destinada a la transportación de combustible y 11 remolcadores. La\nmayoría de estos medios presentan un gran deterioro causado por\nalrededor de 35 años de explotación sin una reparación adecuada.\nEn el caso de los remolcadores aunque presentan un estado\naceptable, llevan explotándose más de 40 años lo que inciden en\nsu capacidad técnica. Estos medios no son suficientes lo que motiva\nque a veces es utilizado en varios puertos, provocando mayores gastos de combustible y demoras para los barcos entrando al puerto.\n\n79\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.10.4 Transporte aéreo\nActualmente el número de vuelos totales programados publicados\npor día (llegadas y salidas) es de alrededor de 40, las cuales están\nprincipalmente concentrados durante las horas tempranas de la\nmañana y al final de la tarde, con escasos vuelos durante el día. La\ndemanda potencial para los vuelos nacionales es alta, especialmente\nentre turistas extranjeros, sin embargo como el número de naves es\nlimitado, no es posible incrementar el tráfico aéreo en las rutas\nLa flota de operación de Cubana está limitada a seis (6) pequeñas aeronaves operadas para vuelos nacionales/regionales y tres\n(3) Ilyshin IL 96 que son aeronaves de gran ancho de fuselaje para\nvuelos de largas distancias. Para rehabilitar los vuelos y remplazar\nlos aviones inmovilizados, Cubana está alquilando aeronaves (con\ny sin tripulación) de varios operadores extranjeros.\n1.10.5 Estrategias y planes del sector relacionadas\ncon la mitigación\nEntre las nuevas estrategias del sector está la promoción del uso de\nvehículos eléctricos, para lo que se ha elaborado una Propuesta de\npolítica para el uso y desarrollo perspectivo de los vehículos eléctricos en el transporte automotor 2020– 2030.\nEn estos momentos se explotan 40 ómnibus híbridos (eléctrico-Diésel) en la transportación de pasajeros en la capital, del tipo\nrígido de la firma Yutong. Funcionan con baterías eléctricas dos\ntaxis de la Empresa Taxi Cuba, una flota de 24 paneles de la Empresa Aguas de La Habana y un ómnibus operado por la Empresa\nde Ómnibus Urbano de la capital.\nSe continúa con el proceso de remotorización de los vehículos,\ncomo una forma de ahorro energético y por ende como una medida de mitigación.\nSe trabaja en el incremento de las transportaciones de pasajeros\npor ferrocarril, a partir de la adquisición de nuevos coches ferroviarios, así como el traspaso de carga del transporte automotor a\nferroviario para medianas y largas distancias.\nA escala de proyecto se trabaja en la implementación de un sistema de transporte bajo en carbono para La Habana, que permitirá evaluar y medir los resultados del mismo a partir del uso de la\nenergía eléctrica.\n\n80\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.11 Construcción\nLas principales emisiones de CO2 y partículas sólidas en este sector se derivan de la producción de materiales para la construcción (Tabla1.8). Además, en el sector están promoviendo una serie\nde acciones relacionadas con el cambio climático debido a lo cual\ncomo política está el incremento en cantidad de proyectos de investigación y como línea de deseo la introducción de tecnologías\nahorradoras de portadores energéticos (mediante paneles solares)\ny de recursos hídricos dentro de los procesos de producción industrial y de otra índole en el sector.\nTabla 1.8 Principales materiales de la construcción producidos en\nel país\nProducciones (Mt)\n2014\n2016\nCal\n51.5\n48.6\nCemento\n1,579.9\n1,492.6\n1.12 Desarrollo local\nEl desarrollo local en Cuba se asume como un proceso esencialmente endógeno, participativo, innovador y de articulación de\nintereses entre actores, territorios y escalas (municipal, provincial\ny sectorial/nacional). Se sustenta en el liderazgo de los gobiernos\nmunicipales y provinciales para la gestión de sus estrategias de\ndesarrollo dirigidas, desde la gestión del conocimiento y la innovación, al fomento de proyectos que generen transformaciones\neconómico-productivas, socioculturales, socioculturales, ambientales e institucionales, con el objetivo de elevar la calidad de vida\nde la población.\nLa visión del desarrollo territorial al 2030 se caracteriza por\nla objetividad de estrategias de desarrollo municipal y planes de\nordenamiento territorial y urbano que constituyen la base del proceso de planificación e inversión, que contribuyen a reducir las\ndesproporciones territoriales.\nEn el contexto nacional actual, se avanza hacia un proceso de\ndescentralización a partir del otorgamiento constitucional de una\nmayor autonomía municipal, con lo cual el desarrollo local adquiere mayor relevancia.\n\n81\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos municipios que se incorporan a esta perspectiva, orientan\nsu proceso de desarrollo sobre la base de su Estrategia de Desarrollo Municipal (EDM), conformada por programas y proyectos que\nresponden a políticas locales. Este instrumento rector del sistema\nde planificación a nivel municipal, se compatibiliza con el Plan\nGeneral de Ordenamiento Territorial y Urbano, lo cual propicia el\nestablecimiento de relaciones horizontales a través de la articulación multiactoral y multisectorial, permitiendo un uso más efectivo de los recursos disponibles.\nLos efectos del cambio climático tienen una expresión más concreta a escala local, pero también desde ella pueden acometerse\ngran parte de las acciones necesarias para su enfrentamiento, tanto en términos de mitigación como de adaptación, constituyendo\nuna prioridad orientada a garantizar la sostenibilidad del desarrollo. En este sentido, se promueve la inserción de este enfoque en\nlas políticas, programas y proyectos asociados a las EDM, así como\nla gestión de diversas fuentes de financiamiento para reducir las\nvulnerabilidades de cada territorio conforme a sus particularidades sociales, económicas y ambientales.\n1.13 Prioridades y objetivos de desarrollo\nLa sociedad cubana se encuentra en proceso de actualización de\nsu modelo económico y social de desarrollo socialista. En abril de\n2016, el 7mo. Congreso del Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) analizó y aprobó la Conceptualización del Modelo Económico y Social\nCubano de Desarrollo Socialista, las Bases del Plan Nacional de\nDesarrollo Económico y Social hasta el 2030: Visión de la Nación,\nEjes y Sectores Estratégicos y los Lineamientos de la Política Económica y Social del Partido y la Revolución para el período 20162021. Estos documentos fueron sometidos a un amplio proceso de\nconsulta popular y posteriormente se aprobaron por la Asamblea\nNacional del Poder Popular el 1 de junio de 2017.\nEn las Bases del PNDES hasta el 2030, se establecen seis ejes\nestratégicos, diseñados bajo un enfoque sistémico, que articulan\nla propuesta de desarrollo económico y social hasta el 2030 y\ncontribuyen, desde su área de influencia, a la consecución de ese\npropósito a largo plazo.\n\n82\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos seis ejes estratégicos son:\n1.\tGobierno socialista, eficaz, eficiente y de integración social;\n2.\tTransformación productiva e inserción internacional;\n3.\tInfraestructura;\n4.\tPotencial humano, ciencia, tecnología e innovación;\n5.\tRecursos naturales y medio ambiente\n6.\tDesarrollo humano, equidad y justicia social.\nEn torno a estos ejes estratégicos se establecen veintidós objetivos\ngenerales y ciento once objetivos específicos.\nEl planteamiento programático del país para la determinación\nde su futuro es que “La Visión de la Nación, entendida como el\nestado o situación que se desea alcanzar, se define como soberana,\nindependiente, socialista, democrática, próspera y sostenible. Entre los retos futuros que asume están los asociados a los constantes\ncambios en términos científicos, tecnológicos y climáticos”.\nCon estas premisas el modelo económico que se promueve\nconsidera vital el enfrentamiento al cambio climático y se plantea: Implementar de manera eficaz y eficiente los programas y acciones\npara el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, con énfasis en la adaptación, la reducción de la vulnerabilidad, y la introducción de estrategias\nsistémicas e intersectoriales, así como, Elevar la eficiencia energética y\nel desarrollo de fuentes renovables de energía, lo que contribuye, entre\notros beneficios, a reducir la generación de gases de efecto invernadero, a\nmitigar el cambio climático y a promover un desarrollo económico menos\nintenso en carbono.\nPara cumplir sus metas de desarrollo y de enfrentamiento al\ncambio climático, Cuba, como muchos países en vías de desarrollo, se enfrenta a gigantescos desafíos económicos, a lo cual se\nsuma la aplicación y el recrudecimiento de la política de bloqueo\neconómico, comercial y financiero impuesto por el gobierno de\nEstados Unidos por casi 60 años, que le impide acceder a financiamientos de las principales instituciones financieras internacionales\ny además, mantiene una férrea persecución financiera a aquellos\nrecursos a los que el país ha podido acceder, o a sus transacciones\nfinancieras resultado de su comercio exterior. El bloqueo impide al país acceder a tecnologías, equipamientos y conocimientos\ncientíficos y técnicos requeridos, para su desarrollo sostenible.\nMás recientemente el bloqueo ha continuado recrudeciéndose\ncon la aplicación del Título III de la Ley Helms-Burton, que ataca\nla libertad de comercio y refuerza el carácter extraterritorial de las\n\n83\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsanciones contra Cuba, además de dañar las relaciones económicas y comerciales del país con la Comunidad Internacional.\nLa política de bloqueo constituye el principal obstáculo al\ndesarrollo económico de Cuba y, por ende, a la implementación\ndel PNDES 2030, la Agenda 2030 y sus ODS, la Tarea Vida y las\nNDC.\n1.14 Prioridades relacionadas con la mitigación\ndel cambio climático\nLa contribución de Cuba a las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero es mínima y no rebasa el 0.08 %. No obstante, Cuba\nha realizado esfuerzos importantes en la reducción de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. Fue uno de los primeros países\nen el mundo en iniciar el reemplazo de las bombillas incandescentes (2005), y ha mantenido desde 1959 un incremento sostenido de\nsu cubierta boscosa.\nLa mitigación es apreciada en las políticas nacionales como una\ndimensión esencial del desarrollo que contribuye a la modernización y el desarrollo tecnológico sobre bases de sostenibilidad, al\nfortalecimiento de sus capacidades, la mejora de la efectividad y\neficiencia de los procesos al disminuir el consumo de portadores\nenergéticos de origen fósil, a un uso de tecnologías más eficientes,\na una mejor gestión de los residuos, entre otros elementos importantes y transversales a toda la actividad económica del país.\nCuba produce cerca del 96 % de su energía eléctrica a partir del\nempleo de combustibles fósiles, con una alta dependencia de la\nimportación, elevados costos de generación y una infraestructura\ntecnológica de altas emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero.\nEn respuesta a estas coyunturas, el Consejo de Ministros aprobó\nen 2014 la “Política para el Desarrollo Perspectivo de las Fuentes\nRenovables y el Uso Eficiente de la Energía”, dirigida a aprovechar\nal máximo los recursos renovables disponibles en el país.\nEl Plan Nacional de Desarrollo Económico y Social al 2030\n(PNDES 2030), introduce por primera vez en las políticas públicas\ndel país, el concepto de un desarrollo menos intenso en emisiones\nde gases de efecto invernadero.\nEl 25 de abril de 2017 el Consejo de Ministros aprobó el Plan de\nEstado para el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, conocido también como Tarea Vida. Este Plan tiene un alcance y jerarquía superiores a todos los documentos elaborados anteriormente sobre\n\n84\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\neste tema, además de actualizarlos e incluir la dimensión territorial. El Plan requiere concebir y ejecutar un programa de inversiones progresivas, a corto (2020), mediano (2030), largo (2050) y\nmuy largo plazos (2100).\nEn la “Tarea Vida” aparece una referencia particular a la mitigación y a su implementación en 12 sectores claves del desarrollo:\nseguridad alimentaria, energía renovable, eficiencia energética, ordenamiento territorial y urbano, pesca, agropecuaria, salud, turismo,\nconstrucción, transporte, industria y manejo integral de los bosques.\nEs importante considerar que, desde el punto de vista legal,\nCuba asume compromisos de mitigación, bajo la CMNUCC y el\nAcuerdo de París.\nCuba es parte de la CMNUCC, desde el cinco de marzo de 1994\ny es parte del Protocolo de Kioto desde julio de 2002. Firmó el\nAcuerdo de París el 22 de abril de 2016 y lo ratificó en enero de\n2017. Al ser parte de estos instrumentos internacionales, Cuba adquiere las responsabilidades que derivan de lo dispuesto en ellos.\nCuba presentó su propuesta de Contribución Nacionalmente\nDeterminada (INDC por sus siglas en inglés) el 23 de noviembre\ndel 2015, la cual se convirtió automáticamente en su CND al ratificar el Acuerdo de París. En ella se incluyen contribuciones en\nadaptación, reconocida como prioridad y contribuciones en mitigación. Las CND comunicadas por Cuba están en concordancia\ncon el Plan de Estado para el Enfrentamiento al Cambio Climático\n(Tarea Vida) y con el Programa de Desarrollo Económico y Social\ndel país al 2030 (PNDES 2030).\nSin embargo, mientras que la actual Contribución Nacionalmente Determinada (CND) de Cuba (2015) se concentra en el\nsector de la energía, con un peso importante en las energías renovables, el Plan de Estado amplía las exigencias de la mitigación\na otras políticas sectoriales, incluyendo el sector agropecuario,\nel turismo, la construcción, el transporte, la industria y el manejo de los bosques (Tarea 8), lo cual es potenciado por el llamado a “la promoción de un desarrollo menos intenso en carbono”,\nen las Bases del Plan de Desarrollo Económico y Social al 2030,\nesta extensión de las acciones de mitigación, incluye iniciativas\nvinculadas al uso de la bioenergía, la promoción de la movilidad\nsostenible, el papel de los bosques en la remoción de carbono y la\npromoción de estrategias de desarrollo bajo en carbono.\n\n85\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n1.15 Arreglos institucionales relativos\na la preparación del Primer Informe Bienal\nde Actualización de Cuba\nLa República de Cuba presenta su Primer Informe Bienal de Actualización (IBA) a la Convención Marco de Naciones Unidas sobre\nCambio Climático (CMNUCC). El IBA se ha elaborado con el apoyo financiero del Fondo para el Medio Ambiente Mundial (FMAM)\ny está siendo implementado por el Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología y Medio Ambiente, con el apoyo del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD).\nEl Primer IBA se elaboró bajo las Directrices de la CMNUCC\npara los IBA de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención adoptadas en la 17 Conferencia de las Partes (Anexo III de la\nDecisión 2/CP.17).\nPor la parte cubana, el Centro de Gestión de la Información y\nDesarrollo de la Energía (CUBAENERGÍA), bajo la coordinación\ngeneral del Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología y Medio Ambiente,\ncoordinó, a nivel técnico-ejecutivo, las actividades fundamentales\ncon los organismos y entidades nacionales para la conformación\ndel IBA. La elaboración del IBA se desarrolló en el marco y con el\napoyo del proyecto Tercera Comunicación y Primer Informe Bienal de\nActualización, financiado por el FMAM, con el acompañamiento\ndel PNUD como entidad implementadora y el INSMET como entidad ejecutora cubana.\nEl informe contiene una recopilación de los principales elementos de las circunstancias nacionales con mayor influencia en\nlas emisiones y remociones de GEI y en las acciones de mitigación,\nel inventario nacional de gases de efecto invernadero (INGEI) con\nbase en los datos del año 2016, la información sobre las acciones\nde mitigación, el estado de desarrollo e implementación del sistema MRV y el apoyo recibido y el requerido.\nPara la ejecución de todo el trabajo fue necesario de una coordinación muy estrecha de muchas instituciones nacionales. Un esquema general de los arreglos institucionales para la elaboración\ndel IBA se muestra en la figura 1.13.\nCada uno de los OACEs y ENs designaron funcionarios y especialistas para la conformación de los equipos técnicos que trabajaron cada uno de los capítulos del IBA.\n\n86\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos equipos técnicos estuvieron integrados por funcionarios\ny especialistas de los ministerios y entidades nacionales como el\nMINEM, MINAG, MITRANS, MINDUS, ONEI, IPF, INRH; por entidades y empresas como la UNE, ONURE, CUBAENERGÍA, UH,\nINAF, GEGAN, EIIP, INSMET, CIMAB.\nLa información requerida fue suministrada por la ONEI, por\nlos sistemas estadísticos complementarios de los organismos y por\nentidades y empresas. La coordinación para la elaboración del capítulo 2, referido al INGEI se realizó por el Equipo Técnico del\nINGEI del INSMET. La coordinación para la elaboración del resto\nde los capítulos se llevó a cabo por el Grupo de Cambio Climático\nde CUBAENERGÍA. La redacción final del informe se llevó a cabo\npor CUBAENERGÍA.\nFigura 1.13 Esquema general de los arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del IBA. Fuente: Equipo técnico mitigación CUBAENERGÍA.\nEl trabajo se inició en el año 2017 con un taller, donde participaron\nespecialistas y funcionarios de los organismos, entidades nacionales, centros académicos, universidades, instituciones proveedoras\nde datos e información, todos vinculados a las emisiones y remociones de gases de efecto invernadero y a las acciones de mitigación. Con ese taller quedaron esclarecidos los principales objetivos\ndel trabajo para la elaboración del IBA, las principales actividades\n\n87\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\na abordar y los principales resultados a obtener. En lo fundamental\nquedaron definidos los principales roles y responsabilidades de las\ninstituciones para la conformación del IBA.\nA partir de ese momento se efectuaron un total de 6 talleres,\ncon la participación de los principales especialistas y funcionarios\nvinculados con la elaboración del IBA, donde se iban exponiendo\nlos resultados obtenidos y la marcha de las actividades principales.\nEn los períodos intermedios de los talleres se efectuaron más de\n20 reuniones técnicas con las instituciones involucradas para tratar aspectos específicos del trabajo. En tres ocasiones la marcha del\ntrabajo de elaboración del IBA fue expuesto en el Grupo Nacional\nde Cambio Climático, que dirige la ministra del CITMA y donde\nparticipan representantes de los ministros del resto de los ministerios. Estas reuniones fueron muy importantes para socializar el\ntrabajo, intercambiar experiencias y tomar decisiones importantes\npara dar impulso al trabajo que se desarrollaba.\nUna vez concluida la etapa técnica, el IBA pasó a un nivel de\nconsulta amplio, bajo la coordinación de la ministra del CITMA,\ncon la participación de los representantes de los Jefes de todos los\nOACE y EN implicados. Finalmente, el IBA fue aprobado por el\nGobierno.\n\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nDE LA REPÚBLICA DE CUBA\n\n89\n2. Inventario Nacional de Gases de\nEfecto Invernadero\n2.1 Introducción\nDando cumplimiento al Artículo 4, párrafo 1a y al Artículo 12, párrafo 1a de la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre\nCambio Climático (en lo adelante CMNUCC), Cuba en el marco de\ndos comunicaciones nacionales, ha presentado el reporte de emisiones y absorciones de gases de efecto invernadero (en lo adelante\nGEI) para los años pares de la serie 1990-2002 con las actualizaciones correspondientes (Tabla 2.1).\nTabla 2.1 Inventarios Nacionales de GEI de Cuba comunicados a la\nCMNUCC\nReporte\nAño de entrega\nAños incluidos en el INGEI\nPrimera Comunicación Nacional\n2001\n1990,1994\nSegunda Comunicación Nacional\n2015\nAños pares Serie 1990-2002\n(actualizaciones de 1990,1994)\nFuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.\nEn la 16 Conferencia de las Partes (COP16) con el propósito de\nreportar los avances en la implementación de los objetivos de la\nCMNUCC se estableció que los países en desarrollo deben entregar Informes Bienales de Actualización (IBA) con información actualizada sobre\nlos inventarios nacionales de gases de efecto invernadero18 (en lo adelante INGEI).\nPosteriormente, en la COP17 de 2011 se definió que los países en desarrollo deberían presentar su primer IBA (…) abarcando, como\nmínimo, un año civil anterior en no más de cuatro años a la fecha de\npresentación.19\n18 Decisión 1, párrafo 60(c) del Informe de la Conferencia de las Partes sobre su 16º período\nde sesiones, celebrado en Cancún del 29 de noviembre al 10 de diciembre de 2010.\n19 Decisión 1, párrafo 41(a) Informe de la Conferencia de las Partes sobre su 17º período de\nsesiones, celebrado en Durban del 28 de noviembre al 11 de diciembre de 2011.\n\n90\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nPara la elaboración de estos documentos los equipos técnicos de\nINGEI de los países se basan en las siguientes guías metodológicas:\n• Directrices de la Convención para los IBA de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención (Anexo III de la Decisión 2/CP.17)\n• Directrices para la elaboración de las Comunicaciones Nacionales de las Partes no incluidas en el Anexo I de la Convención\n(Anexo de la Decisión 17/CP.8)\nCuba, simultáneamente con su 3CN, presenta su primer IBA, que\nincluye el INGEI para el año 2016 y la serie 1990-2016. El inventario se elaboró siguiendo las Directrices del Panel Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (Directrices del\nIPCC 2006) según la disponibilidad de datos de actividad para los\ncálculos y siguiendo los principios de transparencia, exhaustividad, coherencia, comparabilidad y exactitud.\nAbarca todo el territorio nacional e incluye las emisiones y absorciones de GEI de origen antropogénico no controlados por el\nProtocolo de Montreal. En este capítulo se describe el proceso llevado a cabo para la elaboración del INGEI, la metodología empleada, los resultados de las emisiones y absorciones de GEI del\npaís, así como las actualizaciones y mejoras incorporadas respecto\na reportes anteriores, entre otros aspectos relacionados con el reporte de los inventarios nacionales de GEI.\nEn la Tercera Comunicación Nacional (TCN) también se incluye un reporte de este capítulo para la misma serie de tiempo.\n2.1.1 Arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del\ninventario\nDesde mediados de la década de 1990 el INSMET coordina la elaboración y presentación del INGEI, bajo la responsabilidad de un\n“Equipo Técnico de Gases de Efecto Invernadero” (ETGEI). Este\nequipo lo lidera un Coordinador General y está integrado por expertos del INSMET y de los equipos de trabajo de cada sector involucrado en el inventario. El ETGEI responde por la elaboración,\nverificación, validación, y actualización sistemática del INGEI, la\npreparación de los informes para las comunicaciones nacionales y\nlos IBA, y por la información que requiera el Sistema Nacional de\nInformación y Estadística.\n\n91\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas instituciones que participan en la elaboración del INGEI\npertenecen a los ministerios relacionados con los sectores que generan las emisiones y las absorciones de GEI; también participan\nautoridades ambientales, instituciones públicas, académicas y productivas. Entre los participantes es relevante la Oficina Nacional de\nEstadísticas e Información (ONEI), institución transversal para todos los sectores, que compila y certifica los datos oficiales del país.\nLas instituciones involucradas con el inventario proveen datos\nde actividad, así como paramétricos y específicos necesarios para\nlas estimaciones. Por otra parte, aportan juicio de expertos, certificación de datos y revisión de informes, como parte del control de\nla calidad, exhaustividad y transparencia requeridos. Lo anterior\npermite refinar las estadísticas nacionales y determinar factores de\nemisión propios de país.\nLos sectores incluidos en el inventario, según las Directrices del\nIPCC de 2006 son: Energía, Procesos Industriales y Uso de Productos (IPPU por sus siglas en inglés), Agricultura, Silvicultura y Otros\nUsos de la Tierra (AFOLU, por sus siglas en inglés) y Desechos.\nLos arreglos institucionales del INGEI se muestran en la figura 2.1.\n Figura 2.1 Arreglos institucionales para la elaboración del INGEI en Cuba. Fuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.20\n20 Se ha comenzado a trabajar según estos arreglos, en correspondencia con lo propuesto\nen las Bases Generales del Sistema MRV del país, que deberá ser formalizado en el futuro.\n\n92\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.1.2 Proceso de preparación del Inventario\nLa elaboración del INGEI contempla una serie de actividades que\nse realizan de manera cíclica, comenzando cada vez que se hace\nnecesario actualizar el inventario para ser sometido a revisión por\nexpertos de la CMNUCC para los IBA y las CN.\nLa duración del ciclo del inventario depende de las circunstancias y los requerimientos de los informes nacionales. El diagrama\ndel ciclo del inventario, que se muestra en la figura 2.2, comprende\nseis ciclos de diferente duración en los cuales se exponen las actividades fundamentales para la elaboración del INGEI.

Para la\nestimación de la incertidumbre se tienen en cuenta además las\norientaciones del IPCC contenidas en las Directrices de buenas prácticas (GPG, 2000). La implementación de las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006 constituye un paso significativo respecto a reportes anteriores en los cuales se seguían fundamentalmente las Guías Revisadas\ndel IPCC de 1996.\nSe incluyen las emisiones y absorciones nacionales anuales de\nla serie 1990-2016 para los cuatro sectores contemplados en las\nDirectrices del IPCC de 2006.\n2.1.3.1 Metodologías\nLas metodologías utilizadas para compilar los datos de cada sector\nson comparables, lo que posibilita la comparabilidad de los resultados obtenidos. En cada sector, se incluyeron las categorías y subcategorías fuentes de emisiones y absorciones existentes en el país\nen las cuales se contó con la información necesaria para realizar\nlas estimaciones correspondientes al nivel de desagregación de las\nDirectrices del IPCC de 2006. Algunas categorías y subcategorías no\nfueron estimadas por la falta de datos de actividad.\nTomando en consideración la disponibilidad de datos de actividad, la información sobre los factores de emisión y los parámetros\nnecesarios para las estimaciones, se aplicaron, fundamentalmente,\nmétodos de Nivel 1, con factores de emisión por defecto y datos\nde actividad generados por instituciones nacionales. En algunas\nfuentes se aplicaron métodos de Nivel 2, con factores de emisión\npropios de país y por defecto. Estos métodos de estimación son:\nMétodo de Nivel 1: Es el “método por defecto”, la instancia metodológica más simple, aplicable cuando no se cuenta con datos de\nactividad propios o factores de emisión país específicos. Si bien el\nmétodo Nivel 1 permite hacer el cálculo, tiene el riesgo de que las\ncircunstancias nacionales no sean debidamente reflejadas.\n\n96\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nMétodo de Nivel 2: Se basa en el mismo procedimiento metodológico del Nivel 1, pero con factores de emisión o datos de actividad paramétricos propios del país o de una región. En estas\ncircunstancias, es altamente probable que las estimaciones de absorciones y emisiones de GEI sean más precisas, por lo cual esta\nopción debiera aplicarse a las categorías principales.\nMétodo Nivel 3: Corresponde a métodos específicos de un país\n(modelos, mediciones in situ censos y otros), cuya aplicación se\nrecomienda siempre que hayan sido debidamente validados.\nLos cálculos se realizaron a partir de la ecuación base que se muestra a continuación utilizando el software del IPCC del 2006 y hojas\nde cálculo desarrolladas por el ETGEI en base a las Directrices del\nIPCC, 2006.\nEcuación 2.1. Método de cálculo de las emisiones de GEI.\nEmisiones=Datos Actividad (DA) *Factor de Emisión (FE)\nTras estimar las emisiones y absorciones de cada GEI en las diversas fuentes se reportan los valores de GEI en forma agregada,\nexpresados en dióxido de carbono equivalente (CO2eq). Fueron\nusados los Potenciales de Calentamiento Global (PCG o GWP por\nsus siglas en inglés) proporcionados por el IPCC en su Segundo Informe de Evaluación en 1995 (SAR por sus siglas en ingles), que se\nbasan en los efectos de los GEI en un horizonte temporal de cien\naños. La tabla 2.3 muestra dichos PCG para los tres GEI estimados\nen el INGEI.\nTabla 2.3 Potenciales de calentamiento global de los GEI directos\nGas\nFórmula Química\n Potencial de Calentamiento\nGlobal a 100 años\nDióxido de Carbono\nCO2\n1\nMetano\nCH4\n21\nÓxido Nitroso\nN2O\n310\nFuente: Segundo Informe de Evaluación del IPCC (SAR, 1995)\n\n97\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.1.3.2 Datos de actividad\nLos datos de actividad provienen de diferentes fuentes teniendo\nen cuenta los sectores del INGEI. La información primaria utilizada proviene de los Anuarios Estadísticos publicados por la ONEI,\nsin embargo, en la actualidad, estos datos cubren solamente solo\nuna parte de la información necesaria para realizar las estimaciones, por lo que se solicita información a los diferentes ministerios\ne instituciones (según figura 2.1) ya que estas no son publicadas por\nla ONEI. A continuación, se describen de forma general las principales fuentes de información para cada sector.\nSector Energía. La ONEI y el Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MINEM) son las dos principales fuentes de información sobre datos\nde actividad (consumo y producción de combustibles) en el país.\nDichas instituciones son las encargadas de la elaboración del Balance Energético Nacional (BEN) en el cual se encuentra la información de producción, oferta interna y consumo nacional de todos los\ncombustibles por los diferentes sectores económicos del país.\nSe obtuvo además, información complementaria desde el Centro de Gestión y Desarrollo de la Energía (CUBAENERGÍA), el\nCentro de Investigaciones y Manejo Ambiental del Transporte (CIMAB), el Ministerio de Transporte (MITRANS), el Ministerio de\nIndustrias (MINDUS), el Grupo Empresarial AZCUBA, el Ministerio de la Agricultura (MINAG), el Ministerio de la Construcción\n(MICONS), así como otras pertenecientes al MINEM.\nSector IPPU. Se cuenta con datos de actividad estadísticos fundamentalmente de producción de diversas sustancias publicados\npor la ONEI, además de otros datos de actividad y paramétricos\nmás refinados aportados por el Ministerio de la Construcción (MICONS), por el Ministerio de Industrias (MINDUS), por el Centro\nde Investigaciones de la Industria Química (CIIQ) y el Grupo Empresarial de la Industria Sideromecánica (GESIME). A partir de esta\ninformación más detallada fue posible la aplicación de un método\nde Nivel 2 en algunas fuentes de emisión. Además, por medio de\ncriterio de expertos se determinó la No Ocurrencia (NO) para algunas subcategorías de la Industria Química.\nSector AFOLU. Se utilizaron varias fuentes de información, tanto\nde datos estadísticos como paramétricos. En la ONEI se publica\nuna cantidad significativa de información referente a la ganade-\n\n98\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nría y a los cultivos en Cuba, con datos certificados por el MINAG\ny sus instituciones especializadas, incluido el Grupo Empresarial\nGanadero (GEGAN). Diversos datos paramétricos de alimentación\ny sistemas de manejo del ganado fueron provistos por otras instituciones académicas del Ministerio de Educación Superior (MES),\ncomo el Instituto de Ciencia Animal (ICA), y la Estación Experimental de Pastos y Forrajes Indio Hatuey (EEPFIH).\nEl aporte de estas entidades, de conjunto con un grupo de expertos\ninternacionales,22 fue determinante en la refinación de los datos de\nactividad referentes a poblaciones ganaderas, alimentación animal\ny manejo del estiércol del ganado en el país para la estimación de\nlas emisiones en las categorías 3.A Ganadería y 3.C Fuentes agregadas\ny fuentes de emisión no CO2 de la tierra.\nLos datos de las categorías forestales se obtuvieron desde el\nInstituto de Investigaciones Agroforestales (INAF) perteneciente al\nGrupo Agroforestal del MINAG. Se obtuvieron además datos estadísticos y paramétricos desde el Instituto de Suelos (IS) y para\nel caso del cultivo del arroz criterios de expertos procedentes del\nInstituto de Investigaciones de Granos (IIG).\nSector Desechos. Las fuentes de datos de actividad y paramétricos\nde mayor importancia son la ONEI la cual publica toda la información estadística referente a la cantidad de población en el país; las\nEmpresas de Servicios Comunales y el Ministerio de Economía y\nPlanificación (MEP) que tributan datos referentes a la generación\nde desechos sólidos; el Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hidráulicos (INRH) que provee información concerniente a los sistemas de\nmanejo de aguas residuales tanto domésticas como industriales.\nOtra fuente de información en este sector la constituye el MINDUS para el caso de las aguas residuales industriales.\nPartidas informativas\nComo parte del módulo de energía, también se estimaron los elementos\ninformativos referentes a Bunkers internacionales y Emisiones de CO2\npor quema de biomasa, que se muestran en el Anexo 3.\nComo buena práctica, se realizó la estimación de las emisiones\nde GEI por 1.A. Quema de combustibles por el método de referencia.\nEn el Anexo 4 se presentan los resultados obtenidos.\n22 En julio de 2019 se realizó en La Habana un Taller de fortalecimiento de capacidades para\nel sector AFOLU del INGEI de Cuba con la participación de varios expertos internacionales.\n\n99\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.1.3.3 Factores de emisión\nLos factores de emisión utilizados en su mayoría, fueron por defecto de nivel 1 tomados de las Directrices del IPPC de 2006.\nSector Energía. Para el cálculo de las emisiones de CO2, CH4 y\nN2O para las subcategorías del grupo 1.A. Quema de combustibles y\nsubcategorías del grupo 1.B. Emisiones Fugitivas se emplearon factores de emisión por defecto de Nivel 1. Aunque se han realizado\nestudios de factores de emisión propios para los diferentes combustibles del país, estos aún están pendientes de revisión y ajustes,\npor lo que se utilizaron los factores procedentes de las Directrices\ndel IPCC de 2006. Para el próximo ciclo del INGEI se utilizarán\nlos factores de emisión propios por tipo de combustible en el país.\nSector IPPU. Los factores de emisión empleados en este sector\npertenecientes a las categorías 2.A. Industria de los Minerales, 2.B.\nIndustria Química y 2.C. Industria de los metales fueron por defecto de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 tanto para Nivel 1 como\nNivel 2. Solamente en el caso de las emisiones relacionadas con la\nProducción de cemento fue posible obtener un factor de emisión\npropio de país para cada año de la serie aplicándose un método de\nNivel 2.\nSector AFOLU. Se utilizaron, en mayoría, factores de emisión\npor defecto provenientes de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nSin embargo, para la subcategoría 3.A.1 Fermentación entérica se\nutilizaron factores de emisión propios de país mediante juicio de\nexpertos del sector en Cuba, expertos asesores de Colombia y el\nETGEI de Cuba en el taller realizado.\nSector Desechos. Para este sector se utilizó el método de descomposición de primer orden (FOD, por sus siglas en inglés) de acuerdo con las Directrices del IPCC de 2006, manteniendo algunos\nparámetros por defecto y agregando datos específicos de país. Para\nel caso de las aguas residuales tanto domésticas como industriales\nse utilizaron factores de emisión por defecto provenientes de las\nDirectrices del IPCC 2006.\nLas metodologías y fuentes de información empleadas para la estimación de las emisiones de GEI por componentes, subcategorías, subsectores y sectores se muestran en el Anexo 1.\n\n100\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLos métodos y criterios metodológicos utilizados para la estimación del INGEI de Cuba, serie 1990-2016 se muestran en el\nAnexo 2 (emisiones provenientes de las diferentes categorías y\nsubcategorías de fuente, tanto para los datos de actividad, factores\nde emisión y los diferentes GEI según las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006).\n2.1.4 Evaluación de la incertidumbre\nLa información sobre incertidumbres, no está destinada a disputar\nla validez de los estimados del inventario, sino para ayudar a priorizar los esfuerzos para mejorar la seguridad de este en el futuro y\nguiar las decisiones acerca de las elecciones metodológicas.\nAunque, para la mayor parte de los países y categorías de fuentes, los estimados de emisiones de gases de invernadero son razonablemente seguros, los reportes del inventario preparados\nutilizando las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 normalmente contienen un amplio rango de estimados de emisiones con diferente\ngrado de calidad.\nSegún las Directrices del IPCC de 2006 y sus orientaciones sobre\nbuenas prácticas y gestión de incertidumbre, la propagación de\nerror (Método 1) y el método de Montecarlo (Método 2) son los\nmétodos más utilizados para la estimación de la incertidumbre de\nemisiones.\nLa serie temporal de inventarios reportada en este IBA utiliza\nsolamente el método 1 de propagación de errores que supone que\nlos errores son pequeños y simétricos, requiere de la determinación\nde expresiones matemáticas de la varianza de una estimación. Estas\nexpresiones a veces resultan ser relativamente extensas y complejas\ny, por tanto, son propensas a errores humanos de cálculo.\nEn la sección 2.4 se presenta el resultado del análisis de la estimación de las incertidumbres para este INGEI.\n2.1.5 Análisis de categorías clave\nLas Directrices del IPCC de 2006 establecen dos criterios para la\nidentificación de categorías clave. Cada uno contempla dos análisis:\n• La evaluación del nivel, en la cual se evalúa la influencia de\ncada una de las emisiones en cada categoría con respecto a las\nemisiones totales en el último año del inventario, y\n\n101\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n• La evaluación de tendencia, en la cual se evalúa el aporte del\ncambio de emisiones de cada categoría en el cambio de emisiones o absorciones totales, entre el último año y un año de\nreferencia.\nExisten dos métodos para cada criterio de evaluación (el método 2,\na diferencia del método 1, integra en el análisis el valor de la incertidumbre como criterio de selección).\nPara la selección de las categorías claves del inventario nacional\nde emisiones GEI para la serie 1990-2016, se llevaron a cabo los\ncuatro análisis disponibles apoyados en la herramienta de cálculo\npara categorías claves versión 2.5 procedentes de las Directrices\ndel IPCC de 2006. En la sección 2.5 se muestra un análisis más\ndetallado de las categorías claves.\nTabla 2.4 Métodos y ecuaciones utilizados para la determinación\nde categorías clave\nMétodo 1\nNivel\nEcuación 4.1, volumen 1, capítulo\n4.

No obstante, para la\nelaboración del correspondiente a la serie 1990-2016, se han llevado a cabo acciones encaminadas a mejorar y establecer una ruta de\ntrabajo que garantice la permanencia en el tiempo del análisis, la\ngestión y el aseguramiento de la calidad. Estos procesos de control\ny aseguramiento de la calidad (QA/QC, por sus siglas en inglés)\n\n102\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\ndotan al inventario de una mayor consistencia y certidumbre en\nsus resultados. El control y el análisis están dirigidos a mejorar la\ncalidad de entrada de los datos de actividad y a la verificación de\nlos factores de emisión utilizados.\nEs un proceso continuo que comienza con el análisis de las categorías estimadas y no estimadas. Las categorías que no se han\npodido estimar, por falta de datos de actividad o de las metodologías apropiadas, y las que se certificaron que no ocurren en el país\nse han reportado usando claves de notación en el Anexo 2.\nComo parte del proceso de control de calidad una vez concluidos los informes de cada sector, se compartieron con expertos\nsectoriales, con el objetivo de esclarecer y revisar las estimaciones\nrealizadas. Este proceso contribuyó a mejorar la calidad de los informes, a certificar la información contenida en los mismos y a la\npresentación de los resultados en el primer IBA.\nEn la tabla 2.26 de la sección 2.6, como parte del plan de mejoramiento, se presentan determinadas acciones que responden a un\nproceso más riguroso de control de la calidad en el INGEI del país.\n2.2 Tendencia de las emisiones agregadas por\nsectores para la serie 1990-2016.\nLas emisiones totales brutas en 2016 se contabilizaron en 50,213.7\nktCO2eq., (tabla 2.7 y figura 2.3). Las absorciones de CO2 fueron de\n27,147.2 ktCO2eq., dando como resultado unas 23,066.5 ktCO2eq. de\nemisiones netas (tabla 2.8 y figura 2.4), disminuyendo en un 39.7 %\ndesde 1990 y en 4.7 % desde 2014.\nTabla 2.5 Emisiones y absorciones de GEI (ktCO2eq.) por sectores\n(excluye FOLU), para años seleccionados del período 1990-2016\nSectores\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n1- Energía\n33294.02\n31199.25\n36051.46\n34731.22\n36134.11\n35411.94\n2- IPPU\n2943.46\n958.37\n1032.84\n1093.53\n844.91\n776.32\n3- Agricultura\n15121.57\n10807.14\n9769.76\n9895.47\n10100.40\n10109.44\n4- Desechos\n3138.51\n2907.03\n3432.04\n3537.05\n3770.55\n3915.96\nTotal\n54497.55\n45871.80\n50286.10\n49257.28\n50849.98\n50213.66\nFuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.\n\n103\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.6 Emisiones y absorciones de GEI (ktCO2eq.) por sectores\n(incluye FOLU), para años seleccionados del período 1990-2016\nSectores\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n1- Energía\n33294.02\n31199.25\n36051.46\n34731.22\n36134.11\n35411.94\n2- IPPU\n2943.46\n958.37\n1032.84\n1093.53\n844.91\n776.32\n3- AFOLU\n-1113.02\n-7470.84\n-14283.91\n-14273.39\n-16554.12\n-17037.76\n4- Desechos\n3138.51\n2907.03\n3432.04\n3537.05\n3770.55\n3915.96\nBalance\n38262.96\n27593.82\n26232.43\n25088.42\n24195.46\n23066.46\nFuente: Equipo Técnico de INGEI.\nFigura 2.3 Emisiones y absorciones de GEI (ktCO2eq.) por sectores (excluye\nFOLU), para la serie 1990-2016.

En el mismo año, las\nemisiones de GEI del sector contabilizaron 35,411.9 ktCO2eq., incrementándose en un 6.4 % desde 1990 y disminuyendo en un 2 %\ndesde el 2014.\nEste incremento se debe, fundamentalmente, al aumento del\nconsumo energético, incluyendo el uso de diésel y de gas natural para la generación eléctrica, así como la utilización de combustibles líquidos para transporte terrestre, mayormente diésel\ny gasolina. La disminución con respecto al 2014 fue consecuencia de los bajos niveles de refinación de petróleo en el año 2016,\ndonde se refinó un 18.5 % menos de combustibles con respecto\nal 2014.\nEn cuanto a las categorías generales del sector, en 2016, el 87.9\n% de las emisiones de GEI correspondieron a la categoría 1.A.

La subcategoría 1.A.1. Industrias de la energía es\nla principal emisora representando el 60.2 % de las emisiones\ndel sector y la componente Generación de electricidad como\nactividad principal representa el 43.3 % de las emisiones entre\ntodas las componentes y subcategorías, considerándose como la\nmás importante tanto en el resto de la serie como en el 2016.\n23 El proyecto ENERGAS, empresa mixta entre operada con capital cubano de Cuba a través\nde la Unión CUPET y la UNE y capital de Canadá por medio de la Sherrit International.\nDisponible en https://www.sherritt.com/English/operations/power/default.aspx.\n\n113\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nEsto se debe a que en el país prácticamente toda la electricidad se\ngenera en centrales termoeléctricas, baterías de motores que consumen diésel y fuel oíl y motores de emergencia a base de diésel. A\npartir del año 2006, el país llevó a cabo un proceso conocido como\nla “Revolución Energética” en el que se llevaron a cabo varias acciones en aras de mejorar el sistema eléctrico nacional, con la entrada\nde una mayor cantidad de plantas generadoras y nuevas tecnologías\nde generación en algunas de las termoeléctricas del país.\nA partir de 2007 comienza un convenio de colaboración con la\nRepública Bolivariana de Venezuela (CUVENPETROL), para refinar grandes cantidades24 de carburantes en la Refinería de Cienfuegos al centro de la isla, por ello las elevadas emisiones en los\naños 2007 y 2008 respectivamente.\nLas emisiones de las 1.A.2. Industrias manufactureras y de la\nconstrucción representaron el 16.3 %. Esta subcategoría comprende tres tipos de industrias principales desagregadas en (Industria\nazucarera, Explotación de minas y canteras y Construcción). Las\ndemás industrias se agregaron en la componente Otras industrias\nmanufactureras. Si bien la esfera industrial en el país sufrió un\ndecrecimiento a inicios del período analizado, en la actualidad se\nencuentra en segundo lugar en cuanto a emisiones del sector se\nrefiere. Aunque aún no se rebasan las emisiones del año base, las\nnuevas inversiones y la elevación de los niveles de producción nacional requeridos, producirán un aumento de las emisiones en el\nsector a corto plazo.\nLas emisiones fugitivas de la subcategoría 1.B.2. Petróleo y Gas\nNatural alcanzaron el 12.1 %, experimentando un crecimiento continuo sobre todo a partir de 1997, cuando se comienzan a explotar\nlos yacimientos en la costa norte occidental del país y se crea la\nempresa mixta ENERGAS, la entrada de plantas de ciclo combinado para la generación eléctrica y el creciente consumo de gas en\nel sector residencial, han sido las principales causas del aumento\nen los consumos de gas natural y petróleo crudo cubano y con ello\nun aumento en las emisiones fugitivas asociadas a las actividades\nextractivas.\nEl 1.A.3. Transporte (principalmente el Transporte terrestre)\nemitió el 6.2 %. Este es uno de los sectores que más ha reducido las\nemisiones desde 1990, cuando representaba el 23 % de las emisiones de la categoría y el 22.3 % de las emisiones del sector Energía.\n24 La renovación de la refinería de Cienfuegos se encontraba inactiva y la inversión venezolana llevara su capacidad de producción a unos 50000b/pd (Feinberg, 2011).\n\n114\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nEste gran decrecimiento en las emisiones tiene su causa principal en la crisis experimentada por el país a inicios de la década de\nlos 90, y, posteriormente por el recrudecimiento del bloqueo estadounidense, que trajo consigo un deterioro en todas las ramas del\ntransporte, desplomándose de manera casi total la flota marítima\ny ferroviaria del país. En el transporte por carretera y la aviación\nlos impactos fueron menores, pero también tuvieron sus consecuencias, los bajos niveles de consumo de combustibles, por la disminución de vehículos circulando en el país, y la disminución del\ntransporte aéreo de cabotaje, incidieron de manera importante en\nlas reducciones de las emisiones hacia finales del período analizado.\nPor último, el sector denominado 1.A.4. Otros sectores (principalmente Residencial) representó el 5.3 % de las emisiones totales.\nDentro de este sector también se ha registrado un descenso en las\nemisiones, sobre todo en el sector residencial que representaba en\n1990, el 7.1 % de las emisiones totales de la subcategoría y en 2016\nsolo el 2.4 %.\nEste marcado decrecimiento es debido, casi en su totalidad, a la\nreducción en los consumos combustibles líquidos en los hogares,\ncomo el querosene y la sustitución de este por gas licuado de petróleo y cocinas de inducción que utilizan electricidad. Los componentes Comercial/Institucional y Agricultura/Silvicultura y Pesca,\nmantuvieron un comportamiento similar en toda la serie.

En 2016 las emisiones del sector llegaron a 776.3 ktCO2eq., representando el 1.6 %\nde las emisiones totales del país excluyendo FOLU, estos niveles\nde emisiones fueron un 73.6 % y 8.1 % inferiores a las correspondientes a 1990 y al 2014 respectivamente. Este es el sector que menos emisiones genera en el INGEI.\nEste sector es donde más se evidenció la crisis económica sufrida a inicios de la década de los 90, lo que se manifiesta claramente\nen la serie analizada para el INGEI. Las emisiones de 2016 por categorías, son inferiores a las de 1990, y para algunas categorías del\n2014.\nLa categoría 2.A. Industria de los minerales (tabla 2.15 y figura\n2.15) es la de mayores emisiones del sector con 709.2 ktCO2eq. para\nun 91.4 %, siendo un 57.2 % menores que las de 1990 y en 5.7 % desde\nel 2014.\nLa categoría 2.B. Industria Química con 50.8 ktCO2eq., representó el 6.5 % de las emisiones, siendo inferiores en 94 % con respecto a 1990 y en 29.5 % desde el 2014. La pronunciada caída de\nestas emisiones en comparación con 1990 se debe a que en ese año\nlas producciones de amoníaco generaron el 67.3 % de las emisiones, y a partir de 1992 dejó de producirse en el país.\nPor último, la categoría 2.C. Industria de los metales con 16.4\nktCO2eq. representa el 2.1 % restante, estando por debajo de las\nemisiones de 1990 y 2014 en un 96.3 % y 20.4 % respectivamente.\nEl pronunciado descenso con respecto al año base se debe a que,\nen ese año, funcionaban en la principal acería del país “hornos de\nsolera” (OHF) que, según datos brindados por el GESIME, en 1992\nfueron reemplazados por hornos de arco eléctrico (EAF), lo que\nprodujo un cambio de factores de emisión para realizar las estimaciones según lo establecido en el cuadro 4.1, Volumen 3, Capítulo 4,\npágina 4.28 de las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nLa notable diferencia existente entre los factores de emisión\npara ambas tecnologías (1.72 tonCO2/ton de acero, para hornos de\nsolera y 0,08 tonCO2/ton de acero, para hornos de arco eléctrico)\ninfluyó de manera significativa en la reducción de las emisiones,\nya que en 2016 se produjo un 27.4 % más de acero que en 1992\n(último año de producción con horno de solera), sin embargo, las\nemisiones fueron un 84 % menores.\n\n118\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.15 Sector IPPU.

Producción de carburo de calcio (años pares\ndesde 1990 al 2004).\nEn 2016, la producción de cemento contabilizó 672 ktCO2eq.\nregistrando valores de emisiones inferiores con respecto al año\n1990 en 55.4 % y 5.7 % en relación con el 2014. Es la subcategoría\nque más influye en la tendencia y las principales variaciones a lo\nlargo de la serie. Las causas fundamentales de la disminución de\nlas emisiones se deben al denominado Período Especial en Tiempos de Paz, provocado por la desaparición del campo socialista y el\nrecrudecimiento del bloqueo de los Estados Unidos contra Cuba.\nEn los años 2006 y 2007 aumentan las emisiones, en gran medida por un aumento en las actividades constructivas en el sector\nresidencial y en instalaciones turísticas. Sin embargo, después del\naño 2013, las emisiones generadas por esta subcategoría disminuyeron debido a falta de financiamiento para la modernización del\nequipamiento que permita alcanzar mejores niveles productivos.\nPara el caso de la producción de ácido nítrico en 2016, se emitieron 50.8 ktCO2eq., lo que representó un 80.9 % inferior a las\nemisiones de 1990 y el 29.5 % desde el 2014. La variabilidad de las\nemisiones en la subcategoría responde a la situación económica\ndel país y a la disponibilidad de materias primas para para la producción de ácido nítrico.\nLa producción de cal sumó en el último año de la serie un total\nde 37.2 ktCO2eq. emitidos, siendo inferiores a las de 1990 en un\n72.7 % y 5.6 % con respecto al 2014. Al igual que la producción de\ncemento, la causa principal de las disminuciones en la subcategoría es la crisis económica sufrida en el país a inicios de los 90. Las\ncausantes de la variabilidad de las emisiones a lo largo de la serie\nestán relacionadas con el mantenimiento de las plantas y con la\nobsolescencia y modernización de las tecnologías productivas.\nLa subcategoría que menos emite dentro del sector es la producción de hierro, acero y coque metalúrgico con 16.4 ktCO2eq. en\n2016. Este valor representó una disminución con respecto a 1990\ndel 96.3 % y del 20.4 % desde el 2014. La causante de tal reducción\nfue el cambio metodológico de los factores de emisión asociados a\nnuevas tecnologías para la producción de acero en el país.\n\n120\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.16 Sector IPPU.

Este crecimiento, y,\nen general, los niveles de cobertura boscosa alcanzados, hacen que\nen esta categoría de fuente las remociones de CO2 superen notablemente a las emisiones en los años evaluados.\nLas categorías 3.A. Ganadería y 3.C. Fuentes agregadas y fuentes de emisión no CO2 de la tierra mantienen un comportamiento similar a lo largo de la serie analizada, ocurriendo las mayores\nemisiones en el año 1990 para ambas categorías (tabla 2.19) y el año\n2005 el de menores emisiones tanto para la Ganadería con 4,362.8\nktCO2eq. como para las emisiones de Fuentes agregadas y fuentes\nde emisión no CO2 de la tierra con 4,511.9 ktCO2eq.\nCon respecto a las subcategorías (tabla 2.19 y figura 2.19) la más\nrepresentativa es la 3.A.1. Fermentación entérica con el 36.3 % de\nlas emisiones del sector sin incluir FOLU contabilizando 3,664.9\nktCO2eq., siendo un 3.3 % menores que las generadas por esta subcategoría en 1990 y un 1.5 % menores que en 2014. Esta reducción\nse debe a la disminución en la masa ganadera en el año final con\nrespecto a los dos años de referencia (1990 y 2014) representando\nel 16.3 % y en 2.9 % respectivamente.\nLe siguen en importancia las 3.C.4. Emisiones directas de N2O\nde suelos gestionados, en los que se emitieron 2,814.8 ktCO2eq.,\nrepresentando el 27.8 % de las emisiones sin incluir FOLU, lo que\nrepresentó un 50 % menos que las emisiones generadas en 1990\ny un 2.3 % superiores a las registradas en el 2014. Las reducciones\ncon respecto al año base tienen su origen en la disminución del\nuso de fertilizantes nitrogenados sintéticos ya que se aplicaron casi\n280 mil toneladas menos en 2016 en comparación con 1990, lo\nque representó un 87.5 % menos de fertilizantes usados.\nLas 3.C.6. Emisiones indirectas de N2O generadas por la gestión\nde estiércol representaron en 2016 el 11.9 % con 1,206.04 ktCO2eq.\nde las emisiones sin incluir FOLU, siendo superiores a las de 1990\ny 2014 en 1.1 % y 6.6 % respectivamente. La principal causa del aumento registrado con respecto al 2014 se debió a que en 2016 aumentaron las cabezas de ganado porcino en 274,800 animales para\nun 16.6 % superior.\n\n124\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLa subcategoría 3.A.2 Gestión del estiércol generó 1,148.9 ktCO2eq. en 2016, para el 11.4 % de las emisiones excluyendo FOLU,\nsuperando las emisiones de 1990 en 6.9 % y las de 2014 en un 5 %.\nEste aumento se encuentra originado por el crecimiento de la\nmasa porcina en el país con respecto a esos dos años.\nLa subcategoría 3.C.5. Emisiones indirectas de N2O de suelos\ngestionados representó el 6.9 % del total de las emisiones del sector\nsin incluir FOLU, expulsando 698.3 ktCO2eq. Dicho valor es un\n57.3 % inferior al registrado para 1990 y 0.48 % al alcanzado en 2014.\nEl origen de este decrecimiento se debió se debió a la disminución\nen el uso de fertilizantes nitrogenados.\nLas emisiones relacionadas con la subcategoría 3.C.7 Cultivo\ndel arroz le suceden con 412.2 ktCO2eq., lo que representa el 4.08\n% de las emisiones en 2016 excluyendo FOLU, siendo inferiores a\nlas de 1990 en 9.6 % y a las del 2014 en 18.4 %. Al tener las emisiones\ndel arroz relación directa con el área sembrada, esta constituyó la\nprincipal causa de las reducciones al compararlas con el año base\ny al 2014, ya que se dejaron de sembrar unas 14,880 hectáreas (ha)\ny 31,556 ha con respecto a esos años.\nEl país tiene una política de incrementar la producción arrocera en el país, y, con la introducción de nuevas tecnologías se ha\nlogrado incrementar los rendimientos entre 0,8 y 1,6 t/ha (Pérez y\nPenichet, 2014), lo que hace que las producciones no se vean tan\nafectadas por la reducción de las áreas de siembra.\nLas restantes subcategorías 3.B.1.a.iv.

Por su parte, las incertidumbres introducidas en la tendencia en las emisiones nacionales totales son del 90.1 %.\nEn términos generales, los sectores que más aportan a la incertidumbre (contribución a la varianza) del 2016 son AFOLU y\nDesechos seguidos de Energía e IPPU.\nEn el sector Energía, la incertidumbre combinada total fue de\n-16.0 % y +45.5 % en 2016. Las fuentes de incertidumbre que en\nmayor medida contribuyen a la varianza se encuentran en las emi-\n\n132\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nsiones fugitivas de CH4 en la extracción de petróleo, seguidas\nde las emisiones de CO2 en los combustibles líquidos para las\nindustrias de la energía y las emisiones de CO2 por el consumo\nde combustibles líquidos en Industrias Manufactureras y de la\nconstrucción.\nLa incertidumbre del sector se explica por los altos valores en\nel uso de factores de emisión por defecto, específicamente para\nel caso de las emisiones de CH4 y N2O en el uso de la biomasa en\nindustrias de la energía y en las emisiones fugitivas por petróleo\ny gas natural, más que por los datos de actividad levantados en el\nBalance Energético Nacional y otras estadísticas consultadas.\nEl sector IPPU presentó una incertidumbre combinada de ± 2.1 %.\nLas fuentes de incertidumbre que más contribuyen a la varianza\nson las emisiones de CO2 en la producción de cemento, seguidas\nde las emisiones de N2O en la producción de ácido nítrico. El principal elemento que influye en las incertidumbres del sector es el\nuso de factores de emisión por defecto, sobre todo en el caso de las\nemisiones de N2O en la producción de ácido nítrico.\nEn el sector AFOLU, la incertidumbre combinada total fue de\n-34.3 % y +51.6 % para el año 2016. Las fuentes de incertidumbre\nque más contribuyen a la varianza se encuentran las absorciones\nde CO2 en las tierras forestales que permanecen como tales, así\ncomo las emisiones indirectas de N2O provenientes de la gestión\ndel estiércol y las emisiones directas de N2O en los suelos gestionados, específicamente por la componente orina y estiércol\ndepositado en pastizales, prados y praderas. En general, la incertidumbre del sector se debe a los numerosos datos paramétricos,\nen su mayoría utilizados por defecto, principalmente en la subcategoría 3.C Fuentes agregadas y fuentes de emisión no CO2 de\nla tierra.\nEn el sector Desechos, la incertidumbre combinada total fue\nde -10.2 % y 16.2 % en 2016. Las fuentes que más contribuyen a la\nvarianza son las emisiones de CH4 en los sitios de disposición de\ndesechos sólidos no categorizados, seguidas de las emisiones de\nCH4 en el tratamiento y eliminación de aguas residuales domésticas e industriales. En general, la incertidumbre del sector se debe\nal uso de parámetros y factores de emisión por defecto, tanto en\nlas emisiones de CH4 por la disposición de desechos sólidos como\nen las emisiones de CH4 del tratamiento y eliminación de aguas\nresiduales domésticas.\n\n133\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.5 Análisis de categorías clave\nLa Tabla 2.24 muestra en filas las fuentes de emisión y absorción\nidentificadas como categorías clave marcadas con X, las columnas\nindican el criterio de identificación según las Directrices del IPCC\nde 2006.

Tierras (a excepción de la Subcategoría 3.B.1.a Tierras Forestales que permanecen como tales calculadas usando las\nGuías Revisadas del IPCC de 1996).\nA partir de este notable vacío, la experiencia desarrollada por\nel IDEAM de Colombia en el Sector AFOLU en general y esta\ncategoría en específico, y en el marco del trabajo cooperativo\nde la Red Latinoamericana de Inventarios de Gases de Efecto\nInvernadero (RedINGEI), Cuba solicita el apoyo financiero y\ntécnico del PNUD/GSP para implementar una cooperación entre\nambos países durante 2019 y 2020 con el propósito de estimar las\nemisiones y absorciones de GEI en esta categoría y así mejorar de\nforma considerable el INGEI de Cuba a incluir en los próximos\ncompromisos internacionales.\n\n138\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\n2.6.1 Plan de mejoras\nCon el objetivo de superar estas dificultades se confeccionó un Plan\nde Mejoras como herramienta de apoyo para futuros inventarios,\nen el cual se recogen los puntos críticos y oportunidades de mejoras\ntransversales y sectoriales (tabla 2.26). Este plan de mejoras permite establecer las prioridades para reducir las incertidumbres en los\nresultados y refinar los procesos de transparencia en los reportes en\nfunción de las principales deficiencias encontradas.\nEste plan de mejoras tiene relación con los esfuerzos del país\nen la implementación de las acciones de mitigación, tema de gran\nimportancia a destacar en los futuros INGEI. En el país se han alcanzado avances este sentido con la elaboración de las “Bases generales para el establecimiento de un sistema de Medición Reporte y\nVerificación (MRV) en Cuba” y se encuentra en fase de confección\nla “Hoja de ruta para la implementación de las contribuciones de\nmitigación en las CND en Cuba”.\nLas actividades de mejora planteadas requieren de la participación\nde diferentes entidades del Estado (Ministerios e instituciones asociadas), como de las universidades, centros de investigación, plantas de\nproducción, además de una importante inversión de recursos.\nLas acciones están dirigidas fundamentalmente a dar solución a\nlos vacíos y barreras institucionales encontradas en el proceso de elaboración del último INGEI. Para ello se parte de mapeos, estudios y\nmesas de coordinación con los organismos involucrados en la provisión de datos de actividad, datos paramétricos que permitan refinar\nfactores de emisión propios de país y la determinación de criterio\nde expertos. En dichos estudios y mesas quedarán identificadas las\nnecesidades de datos para las diferentes componentes, las fuentes\nprimarias de los datos, la captación de los mismos por los sistemas\nestadísticos, (territoriales, complementarios y nacional), así como la\ndisponibilidad periódica de los mismos. A partir de ello serán elaborados y formalizados los arreglos institucionales, con amparo legal,\nentre las instituciones identificadas y el ETGEI y un plan de trabajo\nen el cual se definen las principales actividades a realizar por cada\nuna de las partes para el próximo ciclo del INGEI.\nOtro aspecto a destacar es la ejecución, en la actualidad, de un proyecto que tributa a la elaboración de un “Sistema Nacional de Inventario de emisiones de GEI” (SINGEI). Dicho proyecto proveerá las bases\nesenciales para el fortalecimiento de la actividad realizada por el ETGEI y permitirá la permanencia en el tiempo de dicho proceso ya que\ndotará al INGEI de mayor exhaustividad, confiabilidad y transparencia.\n\n139\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nTabla 2.26 Principales vacíos y barreras encontrados en el proceso de elaboración del INGEI 1990-2016 tanto a nivel de aspectos\ntransversales como a nivel sectorial.

Acciones de mitigación\n3.1 Visión general\nComo se abordó en el epígrafe 2.2 de este documento, en el 2016,\núltimo año en el que se estimaron las emisiones de GEI en Cuba,\nen la estructura de las emisiones totales brutas en ese año se contabilizaron en 50,213.7 ktCO2eq., las absorciones de CO2 fueron de\n27,147.20 ktCO2eq., dando como resultado unas 23,066.5 ktCO2eq.\nde emisiones netas. De las emisiones totales brutas de GEI, el 70.5 %\ncorresponden al sector Energía, las que sumadas con las del sector\nAFOLU, totalizan el 90.7 % de las emisiones del país.\nTeniendo en cuenta el aporte sectorial al inventario nacional\nde GEI, los sectores priorizados para la reducción de emisiones,\nen la etapa actual, son el sector de energía y la agricultura. En estos\nsectores se concentran los esfuerzos del país en la identificación e\nimplementación de las medidas de mitigación.\nSi bien Cuba ha realizado un esfuerzo importante en la conducción de programas que han conllevado a la reducción de las\nemisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, en el país no ha existido\nun sistema que identifique claramente, formule, registre y de seguimiento a esas acciones, desde el punto de vista de la mitigación.\nPara superar esta situación se ha adoptado un enfoque general\npara el diseño e implementación de un Marco de Transparencia\nReforzado bajo el Acuerdo de París (ver punto 4.1), que ha incluido el documento Bases Generales para el establecimiento de un\nSistema MRV en Cuba, que incluye el sistema para las acciones\nde mitigación.\nEl primer esfuerzo de análisis colectivo, a diferentes niveles\nsectoriales y de gobierno, enfocado en la identificación de acciones de mitigación, se realizó durante la formulación, análisis y comunicación de las INDC del país en el año 2015.\nEse proceso tendría un importante impacto en la formulación\ny aprobación de prioridades relacionadas con la mitigación, expresadas en el PNDES 2030 y en la Tarea Vida. En esos documentos, como se analiza en los puntos 1.20 y 1.21, se va más allá de lo\ndeclarado en las CND en cuanto a sectores y objetivos estratégicos.\n\n152\nPRIMER INFORME BIENAL DE ACTUALIZACIÓN\nA LA CONVENCIÓN MARCO DE LAS NACIONES UNIDAS SOBRE CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO\nLas contribuciones de mitigación declaradas por el país en su\nCND26 son:\n1.\tLa instalación, sobre la base de fuentes renovables de energía,\nde 2144 MW de potencia conectada a la red eléctrica nacional,\nque incluye la construcción de:\n• 19 bioeléctricas anexas a los centrales azucareros con\n755 MW a partir de la biomasa cañera y forestal.\n• 13 parques eólicos con 633 MW.\n• 700 MW Fotovoltaicos y,\n• 74 pequeñas centrales hidroeléctricas\n2.\tLa instalación de 200 mil m2 de calentadores solares en los\nsectores residencial e industrial.\n3.\tLa instalación de bombas solares en la agricultura.\n4.\tEl aprovechamiento de los residuos orgánicos para la producción de biogás y la obtención de bioabonos que remplazan\nfertilizantes químicos coadyuvará a la reducción de las emisiones y a la disminución de la contaminación de cuencas hidrográficas y bahías.

Este proceso dio inicio de forma más colegiada y con un seguimiento de Gobierno a partir de la incorporación de Cuba al\nAcuerdo de París. En este último período se han estado creando\nlas condiciones para iniciar a partir del 2021 la implementación\nadecuada de las acciones de mitigación contenidas en la CND.\nNo obstante, Cuba participó en los instrumentos de la convención: Protocolo de Kioto; NAMAs.\n3.2.1 Proyectos planificados bajo el Mecanismo\nde Desarrollo Limpio (MDL) en Cuba\nBajo el Protocolo de Kioto, aunque de forma tardía al final del primer período del Protocolo, se realizó un trabajo de identificación\nde proyectos bajo el Mecanismo de Desarrollo Limpio (MDL).\nAl finalizar el primer período de implementación del Protocolo\nde Kioto, en el año 2012 se disponía en Cuba de 4 proyectos MDL,\ncon diferente grado de desarrollo y en diferentes etapas de aprobación.

Necesidades en materia\nde financiamiento, tecnología\ny desarrollo de capacidades y apoyo\nrecibido\n5.1 Necesidades en materia de financiamiento,\ntecnología y desarrollo de capacidades\nEn el transcurso del desarrollo del IBA, se identificaron barreras\ny vacíos relativos al perfeccionamiento del marco institucional, el\nINGEI y las medidas de mitigación. No obstante, aún el análisis de\nnecesidades es limitado.\nPor otra parte, aún no se dispone de la capacidad ni de la información actualizada para diferenciar las necesidades de apoyo\nfinanciero, de la transferencia de tecnología y el fortalecimiento de\ncapacidades. En cuanto a la evaluación de las necesidades tecnológicas, con el apoyo de UNEP-DTU Partnership, se desarrolló un\nproyecto (TNA) en los años 2010-2012, de mucha utilidad para la\nidentificación en ese entonces de metodologías, sectores y tecnologías para el enfrentamiento al cambio climático, que se requeriría actualizar en correspondencia con los cambios y avances que\nse han ido produciendo las políticas de enfrentamiento al cambio\nclimático.\nEl sistema MRV para el apoyo no está aún diseñado en el país.\nEste subsistema no se encuentra aún incluido en el documento\nelaborado Bases Generales para el establecimiento de un sistema MRV\nen Cuba.\nLas necesidades y el apoyo recibido que se reportan en este IBA\nson el resultado de la recopilación de información aportada por\ndiferentes instituciones, por lo que no es una información acabada, ni completa.

Método de referencia para la estimación de las\nemisiones GEI para la categoría 1.A. Quema de combustibles\nPara el año 2016 se realizó la estimación de emisiones de CO2 por\nquema de combustibles usando el método de referencia según\nlas buenas prácticas recomendadas en las Directrices del IPCC de\n2006. El método de referencia es un método de arriba hacia abajo (top-down) que utiliza los datos de estadísticas de energía del\npaís para calcular las emisiones de CO2 procedentes de la quema\nde combustibles fósiles principalmente, y permite obtener una segunda estimación independiente de las emisiones de CO2 procedentes de la quema de combustible real en los diferentes sectores,\ncon una exigencia limitada en cuanto al esfuerzo adicional y a los\nrequisitos de datos. Se lo puede considerar una verificación cruzada y forma parte del proceso de control de calidad y exhaustividad\nnecesario para el sector energético (IPCC, 2006).\nEl Método de referencia se basa en la hipótesis de que se conserva el carbono de modo que, por ejemplo, el carbono del petróleo\ncrudo es igual al contenido total de carbono de todos los productos derivados, además no establece ninguna distinción entre las\ndiferentes categorías de fuente del sector de energía y solo estima\nel total de emisiones de CO2 de la categoría de fuente 1.A Quema\nde combustibles. Las emisiones son el resultado de la combustión\nen el sector de energía, en el que se usa el combustible como fuente de calor para refinar o producir energía, y de la combustión en\nel consumo final del combustible o de sus productos secundarios\npor las restantes subcategorías y componentes del sector.\nMetodología\nFue utilizada la ecuación expuesta en las Directrices del IPCC de 2006.\nEcuación 2.2.
