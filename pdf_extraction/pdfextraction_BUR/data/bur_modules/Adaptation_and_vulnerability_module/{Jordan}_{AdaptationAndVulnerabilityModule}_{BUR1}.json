It was found out that no well-established\nsystems were available at these organizations. The data received were incomplete. Data for example\n(but not limited to) related to the BRT bus developed in GAM, Al-ghabawi landfill, etc. are information\npresent only in the responsible entity and can’t be tracked from other sources.\nAt present, data collection systems for climate finance do not provide specific information on climate\nfinance flows. Tracking progress will therefore entail compiling information on climate finance from\na mix of individual private entities, public sector actors, and international organizations rather than\none focal point (e.g., MOPIC). Table 6.1 provides information on the support received from national,\nbilateral, and multilateral sources since 2013-2019, including funding, technology transfer, capacity\nbuilding, and technical assistance.\nn\nn Table 6.1 includes resources on grants, general budget, or concessional basis received for sustainable\ndevelopment purposes and for national strategies, and not specifically for climate action, in line\nwith the principle of additionality of climate finance, as per article 4.3 of the UNFCCC.\nn\nn Due to the lack of precise guidelines for the MRV system for support and a consequential lack of\navailable information, resources directed to the private sector were not included.\n\nINFORMATION ON SUPPORT RECEIVED\nJordan’s First Biennial Update Report\n155\nTable 6.1: Mapping financial flows of climate change from national and international sources\nSupport Received\nYear\nProject\nDonor/\nImplementing\n Agency\nType of Support\nProject Objectives\nFinancial\nResources\nCapacity\nBuilding\nTechnical\nSupport\n2015-2019\nIncreasing the\nresilience of poor\nand vulnerable\ncommunities to\nclimate change\nimpacts in\nJordan through\nimplementing\ninnovative projects in\nwater and agriculture\nin support of\nadaptation to CC\nDonor: Adaptation\nfund\nImplementing agency:\nMOPIC\nGrant (USD\n9,226,000)\nX\nX\nThe program seeks through\nits 1st component to support\nclimate change adaptation\nin the agricultural and water\nsectors through technology\ntransfer (the use of nonconventional water resources,\nrain water harvesting, and\npermaculture).
