The essence of the issue will be the\ndefinition of indicators for mitigation actions, which\nwill allow the integration into the existing national\nM&E structure, backed by specific training, capacity\ndevelopment, provision of archiving systems and\ndata base as well as computation infrastructure. The\ncurrent annual reports sent periodically by the\nindustry, water, energy, forests, agriculture and\nlivestock sectors as well as other regulatory bodies\nwill be used for monitoring purposes. MRV / M&A\nmodels will be developed in a sectoral approach\nand incorporated into the existing reporting model\nwhile safeguarding the specific objectives outlined\nby the UNFCCC. Practical training of monitoring\nagents should be regular and will be organized for\ndata providers and data network owners.\n\nOn the other hand, the MRV system development\napproach will therefore be twofold, being oriented\ntowards the national and project based NAMAs.\nThus, whenever a project is within a data provider\nor data network owner (Ministry of Energy and\nEnergy, Agriculture and Livestock, Forestry, Water,\nWaste,\netc.,)\nthis\nwill\nbe\nresponsible\nfor\nimplementing, measuring and collecting data\nregarding implementation and monitoring over\ntime with data being logged in specific format and\nscientific units outlined by the IPCC. This data will\nthen be entered into the IPCC 2006 software for\ncalculating emission reductions in databases\nspecifically developed for MRV purposes.\n\nWhenever there are difficulties in having direct and\nreliable measurements or data on impacts such as\nfuelwood consumption or penetration of energy\nefficient household appliances, efforts will be made\nto track emission reduction or absorption in the\nGHG inventory and make estimates for the emitting\nsource. Further details on the MRV system,\nincluding institutions and their respective roles to a\nspecific sector will be applied in the NAMA project.\nThese individual MRV plans will be validated and\napproved when developing the project report on\nthe NAMAs which will be the sole responsibility of\nthe project implementing institutions.\n\n89 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\n5.3.3 M&E and MRV in Guinea-Bissau -\nPast and ongoing initiatives\nThe country has undertaken several initiatives in the\nfield of mitigating the negative effects of GHG.\nThus, with regard to monitoring, reporting and\nverification (MRV/M&E), there are several past and\nongoing initiatives to emphasize:\n1. Project of quantification of stored carbon and\nthe capacity of sink of forest vegetation of GuineaBissau-CARBOVEG-GB (2007-2009) ― monitoring\nand reporting, financed by the Portuguese Agency\nof the Environment – APA , with the overall\nobjective of contributing to the support of the\nGuinea-Bissau forestry sector in the emerging\ncarbon market, both within the framework of the\nKyoto Protocol and in the framework of voluntary\ncarbon markets. In any of these markets, highquality information on two aspects is essential: (i)\nLand Use and Land Use Changes, with special\nattention\nto\nafforestation,\nreforestation\nand\ndeforestation, and (ii) changes in biomass stocks,\ncorresponding to the living forest component\nabove the soil.\n\nPhoto credit: Joana Benzinho & Marta Rosa. 2015\n\n2. Project Think Global and Local Action (20072009) ― monitoring and reporting, funded by the\nUniversity of Twente (Holland), through the FOCAL\npoint of the UNFCCC, TOD/ITC Institute in\ncollaboration with Enda Tiers Monde /Enda Energy\nprogram, aimed at quantifying living biomass\nabove ground (bvas), Carbon stocked (CO2) and\nequivalent carbon (CO2 eq) in the community\nforest reserve of Djalicunda and Madina Djalocunda\n(north and east of the country, respectively).\n3. Forest monitoring System of Guinea-Bissau\n(SiMoFlor-GB)/2nd phase of CARBOVEG-GB ―\nmonitoring and reporting, in Portfolio, has as main\nobjective\nthe\ndesign,\ndevelopment\nand\ncommissioning of a system of Monitoring of forest\nvegetation, natural and planted, for the entire\nterritory of Guinea-Bissau. This project intends to\nequip and empower the country with a knowledge\nbase and a geographic information equipment that\nsupports the development in the agroforestry\nstrand of the national economy, framed in the logic\nof adaptation and mitigation of Climate change\nimpacts. The project contributed to the promotion\nof clean development actions under bilateral and\nmultilateral programmes (such as REDD and REDD\n+), also supporting investment in sustainable forest\nmanagement and certification of products and\nServices provided by them.\n4. National Initial communication on Climate\nChange\n(2004),\n2nd\nand\n3rd\nnational\ncommunications on Climate Change (2011 and\n2015), respectively) ― report, inserted in the\nframework for the application of articles 4 and 12 Of\nthe UNFCCC, signed at the earth/Rio de Janeiro\nSummit in 1992 and decisions 10/CP2 and 17/CP8:\n(i) reflect national circumstances, with a specific\nemphasis on the aspects of development policies\nlinked to the main components of the process of\nClimate change; (ii) Report the national GHG\nemission inventories (year 2000, 2006 and 2010, as\nreference years respectively), according to the\nmethodology recommended for this purpose by\nthe Convention secretariat and the IPCC; (iii) point\nout the mitigation measures of GHG emissions and\nthe capacities linked to the country's social and\neconomic development policies; (iv) Report the\nstudy of vulnerability and adaptation to climate\nchange; (v) point out measures to adapt to climate\nchange, whereby contributions from external aid\nwill be indispensable; (vi) Report the socioeconomic analysis of the impacts of climate change\nin the country; (vii) point to the need for\nstrengthening national capacities in the field of\ntraining, communication, awareness raising, climate\nchange information in Guinea-Bissau and finally\nother relevant information has been presented and\nConstraints and gaps.\n\n90 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\n\n5.4 Information on National Appropriate Mitigation Actions - NAMAS\nThe proposals for National Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) constitute one of the voluntary\ncommitments of countries with the UNFCCC. The NAMAs concept emerged in the Bali COP (Paragraph 1.b\nii)). The Bali action plan called for \"a national easing of appropriate mitigation for developing countries in\nthe context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacitybuilding strengthening\" Measurable, Monitored and Verifiable-MRV \". The NAMAs proposition should\nserve as a bridge between developed countries and developing countries, following the principle of\n\"common but differentiated responsibilities, of agreeing with the national circumstances of each country\".\nThrough international negotiations, NAMAs have been improved. NAMAs can be a simple project or a\nprogram and/or sectoral policies that can generate REDUCTIONS in GHG emissions.\n\nThe NAMAs concept is still in the evolution phase\nand can be implemented differently depending on\nthe type of support expected by developing\ncountries. There are three types of NAMAs: (i)\nUnilateral NAMAs: Actions to MITIGATE/reduce\nGHG emissions produced by developing countries\nwith own resources; (ii) supported NAMAs: Actions\nto mitigate/reduce GHG emissions produced by\ndeveloping countries with support from developed\ncountries in terms of technology transfer, financing\nand training, and (iii) NAMAs credits: Actions to\nmitigate/reduce GHG emissions, resulting in a\nprobability of carbon credits to be placed on the\ncarbon market.\nThe Copenhagen Accord focuses essentially on four\nkey areas: (i) medium-term emission reductions by\nindustrialized countries; (ii) measures to be taken by\ndeveloping countries to limit emissions; (iii) funds to\ncarry out the necessary actions; and (iv) equitable\ngovernance of the regime adopted to combat\nclimate change.\nGuinea-Bissau has acceded to the Copenhagen\nAccord in the same way as the 55 countries that\nacceded to it (until 31 July 2011) and has thus made\ncommitments to draft NAMA ideas with the\nUNFCCC, but as yet the country has not has your\nNAMAs Strategy and / or Policy. For the elaboration\nand implementation of NAMAs the country needs\nfinancial and technical support as well as individual,\ninstitutional and systemic capacity building.\nThe Cancun Conference also succeeded in restoring\nthe content of the Copenhagen Accord under\nUNFCCC auspices. This means that the individual\npromises of GHG emission reductions submitted by\ncountries under the Copenhagen Accord have\nalready been recognized by the Convention. This\nwas a remarkable milestone, because for the first\ntime, both developed and developing countries\nhave agreed on actions to reduce emissions. The\nfinancial\ncommitments\nmade\nby\ndeveloped\ncountries were also taken into account.\n\nWith the final decisions of the UNFCCC, Cancun laid\nthe\nfoundations\nfor\nbuilding\nappropriate\ninstitutions and the MRV funding frameworks for\nactions. NAMAs promise to become a primary\nmechanism\nfor\nachieving\n\"common\nbut\ndifferentiated responsibilities\" in the fight against\nclimate change. The Cancún Agreement and the\nDurban COP brought significant milestones in\nrelation to NAMAs. At the COP 18 in Doha, Qatar,\nthe operationalization of the Green Climate Fund\n(GCF), a central register and guidelines for MRV\nreporting\nis\nexpected\nto\nbe\ncreated\nand\nimplemented to increase the NAMA framework for\ncarbon reduction actions in the developing\ncountries.\n\n5.4.1 Development of NAMAs\nGuinea Bissau has developed legal and institutional\narrangements for the implementation of NAMAS.\nThe National Designated Authority for Kyoto\nMechanisms (AND-GB) was established by Decree\nNo. 11/2006 of the Council of Ministers of 11 August,\npublished in Official Bulletin No. 34 of 22 August\n2006 and has Competences include approving and\nfollowing up on the implementation of projects\nunder the Kyoto Flexibility Mechanism - Clean\nDevelopment Mechanism. It is an inter-ministerial\nbody composed of several ministries and is in the\nprocess of raising international financial resources\nfor the elaboration of the operating regulations of\nits National Designated Authority for the Kyoto\nMechanisms, in order to enable it to fulfil the\npurposes for which it was created.\nFollowing this, a document titled \"subsidy for\ndevelopment of proposals for national action for\nAppropriate mitigation (NAMA)\" was prepared.\n\n91 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\n1. The 2011 African Development Bank (ADB) -\nfunded National Appropriate Mitigation Action Plan\n(NAMAS) grant was part of the AfDB's support to\nhelp the 13 African countries that had not\nresponded to UNFCCC on the development of its\nNAMA proposals before the 17th Conference of the\nParties (COP 17) held in Durban from 28 November\nto 9 December 2011. As a result of this work, a\nportfolio list of projects that were submitted to the\nUNFCCC Secretariat prior to COP 17 was prepared\nand it was concluded that Guinea-Bissau needs\nsupported NAMAs as the country needs foreign\nresources to support NAMAs.\nSince then several initiatives were undertaken not\nexactly as NAMAs but in the context of Low\nEmissions and Development Strategies - LEDS\ninitiatives.\n\n5.5 Information on Low Emissions and Development Strategies - LEDS\nLow Emissions and Development Strategies - LEDS initiatives provides a direct link between mitigation and\nachieving sustainable development, while climate change is a cross-cutting issue across all the sustainable\ndevelopment goals (SDGs) particularly the SDG 13 (climate action). The Strategy allows the country to\ndecarbonize the economy without threatening the country’s long-term development objectives or limiting\nachievement of the SDGs. The LEDS also provides the opportunity to integrate national sustainable\ndevelopment objectives into the context of “deep decarbonization” and vice versa, Regrettably, GuineaBissau has not yet developed and submitted its LEDS, but it has developed a number of initiatives which\nmay be framed within the LEDS context.\n\n5.5.1 Initiatives in the context of LEDS in\nGuinea-Bissau\nAs for the Low carbon Development Strategy\n(LEDS), several past and other initiatives have been\nundertaken which falls into the context, namely:\n1. Project rational use of forest heritage -\nCARBONIZATION (1997-2000)- financed by the\nEU/FAO whose objective was to allow a rational use\nof forest heritage using new and improved\ntechniques of wood processing and organize new\nforest stands.\n2. PREDAS Project (2005) – Regional Project,\naimed at ensuring the supply of residential or urban\nand rural households in domestic fuels, on the basis\nof participatory, integrated management and\nLasting the natural resources of the territories of the\n“tabancas”, accelerating and modernising the\nsubstitution of the trade in woody energies;\nImprove the living conditions of rural and urban\npopulations, develop modern technologies and\nactivities\nthat\ngenerate\njobs\nand\nincomes,\nstrengthen the coherence, coordination and\nefficiency of actions and develop the capacity to\nintervene Private, local actors in the implementation\nof activities with a view to improving the sub of\ndomestic energy.\n3. Butanisation Project -This is an initiative\nlaunched in the years 90, which aimed to provide\nbutane gas as an alternative energy source for rural,\nperi-urban and urban populations in order to\nreduce pressure in forests – the basis of Domestic\nenergy (firewood and coal).\nRiver Corubal (Saltinho) – Tombalí Region – Guiné-Bissau\nPhoto credit: José Valberto Teixeira Oliveira. 2009\n\n4. Project Vulgarization of biogas production\ntechniques and its durable use -was intended to\nensure regular, durable and less costly supply to the\nconsuming populations of biogas produced\n(domestic fuel). The project advocated the\nconstruction of 20 biodigesters, aiming on one side\nthe fight against deforestation and desertification\nand on the other hand, the rationalization of the\nconsumption of firewood and coal through the\nintroduction and vulgarization of the techniques of\nbiogas production for cooking, lighting and\nbiofertilizer for horticulture in the rural world and in\nthe peripheral and peri-urban areas, with key\n\n92 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 5: Information on domestic MRV of Domestically supported\nNAMAs\npopulations (basic associations, livestock breeders,\nNGOs, etc.).\n\nPhoto credit:\nJoana Benzinho & Marta Rosa. 2015\n\n5. Solar Regional Program-PRS2, funded by The\nEU, had as its main objective to fight for poverty\nreduction within the scope of DENARP, to improve\nthe living conditions of populations and to\nstrengthen the national private photovoltaic sector.\n\n6. Project Woodfuel Integrated Supply/Demand\nOverview Mapping (WISDOM) Methodology\n(WISDOM),\n started in December 2009 and developed by FAO\nand the government of Guinea-Bissau in order to\nenable Rational management of woody energy, to\nsupport the planning of it by integrating and\nanalysing\nthe\nexisting\nrelationship\nbetween\nproduction-consumption and providing useful\nelements for the formulation of new strategies for\nthe woody/domestic energy sector.\n\n7. Under the National Authority designated for the\nKyoto\nmechanisms\nthe\nECOPROFITABLETM\nLighting Africa program was endorsed. The\nobjective was to replace inefficient lighting in\nhouseholds in Africa (Algeria, Angola, Benin,\nBurkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast,\nEgypt, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial\nGuinea, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Mali, Malawi,\nMorocco,\nMauritania,\nMozambique,\nNamibia,\nNiger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Chad, Tunisia)\nunder a CDM project, through the distribution of\n200 million low light bulbs Consumption (CFLs), at\nthe same time reduces GHG emissions and will\nreduce the demand peak by 10,000 MW. It has as\nspecific objectives Promotion of low energy lamps\nfor residents of households in Africa, to reduce the\npeak of maximum demand for electricity.\n\n8 Training for the development of resilient low\ncarbon strategies - a project in the context of the\nPortuguese fast start in which will participate 4\nAfrican countries of Portuguese expression (Cape\nVerde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Sao Tome\nand Principe), with main objective of providing\nthese countries with the necessary skills to develop,\nimplement, measure, report and verify a strategy\nfor the development of low-emission Gases with\nGreenhouse effect (GHG) adapted to the impacts of\nclimate change and consistent with the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, in particular poverty reduction\nand the guarantee of environmental sustainability.\n\n9. SOLAR - a solar project carried out by the IBAS\nproject in 20 Tabancas of the country. In the\nframework of the energy facility of the EU 3 projects\nare underway:\n• Solar electrification project of the village of\nBambadinca with a potential of 412 KVA, which\nshould be carried out by the NGO TESE;\n• Solar electrification project of the city of Gabu\nthat is being carried out by the NGO FRES;\n• Solar electrification project of the city of Bissorã\nwhich is being held by ADPP NGO;\n• In the framework of the ECOWAS Regional\nCentre for Renewable Energies and energy\nefficiency (ECREE), the country has benefited from\nfinancing for the electrification of five (5) Tabancas\nwith the use of solar panels.\n\n10.

Wind - VERGNET - France - diagnostic study on\nthe wind potential in the islands of Bubaque and\nBolama (Bijagós Archipelago) with the aim of\ncreating a wind farm whose ultimate purpose is to\nable to provide Electricity to these two sites, from\nwind turbines and solar generators, to: (i) water\npumping and (ii) to ensure the illumination of public\ninfrastructures;\n\n5.6 MRV, NAMAs and LED - Supported received\nGiven the socio-economic situation of the country and the magnitude of the environmental problems that\nit faces, the Government of Guinea Bissau has frequently requested international and bilateral aid to\novercome some of the barriers that limit progress in the management of the countries’ resources and help\nto minimize the impacts of environmental problems. In this regard, Guinea Bissau has received a number\nof international aid over time, some of which are of assistance to the sectors involved in fight against the\nimpacts of climate change, of which the most significant are presented in Table 5.1. The Government of\nGuinea Bissau takes this opportunity to thank all partners who have long supported the Adaptation and\nMitigation of Climate Change in the country.\n\nTable 5.1 – Support received in the context of MRV, NAMAs and LED activities.\nProject/Programme\nAmount\nActivity\nSource\nCARBOVEG-GB\n(2007-2009)\n€470,000\nProject for Quantification of stored carbon and sink\ncapacity of Guinea-Bissau forest vegetation - - Monitoring\nand Reporting, funded by the Portuguese Environment\nAgency - APA), with the overall objective of contributing to\nthe support of Guinea-Bissau's forestry sector in the\nemerging carbon market, both under the Kyoto Protocol\nand under voluntary carbon markets.\n\nPortuguese\nEnvironment\nAgency - APA),\nThink Global and\nLocal Action Project\n(2007-2009)\n€37,000\nThe objective was the Quantification of Above-Ground\nLiving Biomass (BVAS), Stock Carbon (CO2) and Equivalent\nCarbon (CO2 equiv) in the Community Forest Reserve of\nDjalicunda and Madina Djalocunda (North and East of the\ncountry, respectivel\nMonitoring\nand\nReporting,\nfunded by the\nUniversity\nof\nTwente\n(Netherlands) for\nthrough\nthe\nUNFCCC\nFocal\nPoint\nUniversity\nof\nTwente\n(Netherlands)\nGuinea-Bissau Forest\nMonitoring System\n(SiMoFlor-GB) /\nPhase 2 of\nCARBOVEG-GB\n€938,063\nThis project aimed to equip and empower the country with\na knowledge base and an instrument of geographic\ninformation that supports the development in the agroforestry aspect of the national economy, framed in the\nlogic of adaptation and mitigation of climate change.

The pillars show the\nemergence in 2025 of a diversified economy alongside traditional domestic sectors (construction, trade\nand distribution), and competitiveness-critical support sectors (energy and e-governance) and the four\nmajor drivers of growth. Thus, solid and concrete intermediate targets for each of the drivers of growth\nhave been set for 2020: Rice self-sufficiency, double cashew revenues, tourism development in Bijagós\n(20,000 tourists in 2020), double revenues and value added of fishing and development of the phosphate\nbuilding and mining sector in Farim at one of the sites. In order to fully develop the engines of growth, five\n(5) Axis were defined: (i) peace and governance; (ii) biodiversity and natural capital; (iii) infrastructure and\nurban development; (iv) human development and (v) business environment.\nTraditional Bijago Fire Dance\nhttps://kwekudee-tripdownmemorylane.blogspot.com/2012/12/bijago-people-guinea-bissau-african.html\n\n101 | Guinea-Bissau First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\n6.2 Climate Change in the framework\nof National strategic development\nThe PRSP II proposal TERRA RANKA Strategic and\nOperational Plan (2015-2025) takes a firm stance\nwith regard to climate change by stating that:\n“Development strategies for different growth\nsectors should become low carbon and climateresilient development strategies to promote\nsustainable development”. One of the Guiding\nPrinciples is “promoting sustainable development\nthat is more resilient to climate change” and\npermeates the various axes of the strategy. In\nparticular, Axis 3 “Promoting sustainable economic\ndevelopment” and Axis 4 “Increasing the level of\nhuman capital development specify adaptive and\nmitigating actions to be undertaken”, while Axis I\ninclude the “prevention and risk management of\nnatural disasters”. The following components can\nbe listed as highlighted by DENARP II:\n• Integration of climate change issues into national\nand sub-national development policies, strategies\nand plans;\n• Adaptation of agricultural systems;\n• Durable land and water management;\n• Protection of coastal systems;\n• Protection of biodiversity;\n• Measures to reduce the risk of natural disasters\n(civil protection);\n•Spatial planning (land registry, forestry, agricultural\nand urban planning);\n•Energy\nefficiency\n(including\ndomestic,\ntransportation) and renewable energy;\n• Climate proofing of infrastructure.\n\nThe priority areas identified in the PRSP II result from the findings of the country's work on climate change\n(eg. First, Second and Third National Communications, National Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan\n(NAPA), among others).\n\nThe Presidential Palace in Bissau - official residence of The President of Guinea Bissau\n\n6.2.1 Key Sectors of the Strategic\ndevelopment\nIn the context of the TERRA RANKA Strategic\nDocument 2015-2025 the Biodiversity and Natural\nCapital axis aims to preserve and value the country's\nnatural resources in a sustainable way. This axis\ndefined the rules governing human activities to limit\nanthropogenic pressures on the environment and\nincrease the resilience of ecosystems to the threats\nof climate change. It revolves around two main\nfields of action: (i) institutional development, which\naims above all to establish a regulatory and\ninstitutional framework of reference and to provide\nGuinea-Bissau with a legal body, an innovative\ngovernance and financing model that gives a status\nof an Africa country at the forefront of sustainable\ndevelopment; and (ii) sustainable management of\necosystems where our ecosystems and biodiversity\nshould be better and better known with the\n\n102 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nfinances for improved safeguarding of vulnerable\nresources, implementing the National Protected\nAreas Strategy to enhance these 15% to 26%% of\nland, favouring the preservation of ecosystems\nacross the territory, ensuring respect for biological\nbalances and finally implementing a Climate Plan to\nincrease the resilience of national ecosystems to\nclimate change.\n\nThe Infrastructure and Urban Development Axis\nThis Axis aims to provide the country with the\nlogistics, energy, digital and urban infrastructures\nnecessary for its development. In order to achieve\nthe above, the following interventions will be\nneeded: (i) in the transport sector, blockages will be\neliminated (rehabilitation of Bissau port and urban\nroads, priority inland waterways and inland\nwaterways); (ii) in the energy and water sector, a\nmajor turnaround is needed by developing 90 MW\nby 2020 and significantly improving access to safe\ndrinking water and sewerage / sanitation facilities;\n(iii) in the digital system, the digital system needs to\nbe transformed into a true growth lever for the\neconomy as a whole; and (iv) in land management\nand urban development, it is necessary to renovate\nand build urban centers in order to provide them\nwith functional infrastructure and systems and\nestablish them as epicentres of economic activity.\nIn this context, the priorities are based on the\ndevelopment of the Bolama-Bijagós Archipelago\nand the five main urban centers.\n\nThe Human Development Axis\nThis Axis aims to enhance the potential of the\nGuinean population, to ensure that their basic\nneeds are met, to implement a social safety net and\nto\ndevelop\ntheir\nskills,\nproductivity\nand\nemployability. This requires investing in: (i)\neducation and employment; (ii) health; (iii) social\nprotection for large-scale poverty reduction\nthrough the creation of both a safety net and real\nempowerment opportunities for the poor; and (iv)\nculture, youth and sports that will be especially\nbearers of a major cultural renewal.\n\nThe Simplification of Business Sector and Private\nSector Development axis aims to implement an\nenabling environment for the private sector. It is\nabout creating favourable conditions for the\nflourishing of the private sector, which is essential\nfor the development of investments and the\npositioning of the engines of growth. Business\nscope\nsimplification\nrevolves\naround\nthree\nprograms: (i) development of a conducive and\ncoherent national legal framework; (ii) business\nscope reform; and (iii) implementation of integrated\neconomic platforms with the creation of a\nmultisectoral Special Economic Zone in Bissau.\n\n6.2.2 Climate Mitigation in the context of national sustainable development objectives\nand plans\nThe cost benefit of mitigation resulting from\nnational sustainable development objectives and\nplans has not yet been estimated. The country is\nworking on this. Even so it is expected that:\n― By increasing the percentage of protected areas\nfrom 15 to 26%, according to the National Protected\nAreas Strategy the capacity of carbon sinks will\nincrease and hence the national effort to tackle the\ndamaging impacts of climate change. It will\nstrengthen the country's existing capacity to\nparticipate in the REDD + mechanism in accordance\nwith the Cancun and Warsaw framework as a way\nof receiving funding for efforts to reduce\ndeforestation and forest degradation, forest\nconservation and management, and increase of\ncarbon stock.\n\n― In its most recent planning, the Government\nemerging from the last democratic elections of\nApril 2014, has proposed for the energy sector a\nprominent role in its ten-year strategic and\noperational plan “Vision Guinea-Bissau 2025-Terra\nRanka”. In essence, the Administration envisages\ninvestments for the reinforcement and extension of\nthe 90 MW power plant by 2020. These investments\nwould be combined with others, such as those for\nthe\nimplementation\nof\na\nnational\nenergy\ntransmission grid. On the other hand, as part of its\nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy, NPRSP II\n(2012), the country has programmed investments\nfor the power system to increase its installed\ncapacity by 60%. In both the first and the second\ncase, the planned investments did not specify the\ntypology of the energy sources to be used for the\n\n103 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nstrengthening of electricity production, and it is\ntherefore understood that such investments are\nmainly concerned with fossil fuel power generation,\nie diesel and fuel oil.\n\n6.2.3 Climate adaptation in the context of national sustainable development objectives\nand plans\nAs with mitigation, the cost-benefit of adaptation at\nnational level has not yet been estimated. Similarly,\nit is expected that by increasing the percentage of\nprotected areas from 15 to 26%, the capacity of\nnational ecosystems to adapt will certainly increase\nby enhancing soil protection against water and\nwind erosion and protecting the coast against sea\nlevel rise and other types of erosion. It should be\nnoted that Guinea-Bissau has a considerable\ncoastline (approximately 300 km) where the vast\nmajority of the population lives, and much of the\ninfrastructure, equipment and major economic\nactivities are in place and practiced in this coastal\narea.\nThe Project on resilience and adaptability of the\nagricultural sectors to climate change in GuineaBissau did the cost-benefit analysis of adaptation in\nthe Gabu region, (taking into account the\ndevelopment trend baseline) and it shows that the\ncapacity of the Guinea-Bissau to adapt to climate\nchange will be low. Any endeavours that may exist\nwill most likely be through international initiatives\nand NGO efforts, both with scarce funding and\ninadequate\nmanagement,\nwith\nlittle\ndeep\ngovernment commitment due to lack of low\nfinances and weak institutional capacity.\n\nAlternatively, the country may have the capacity at\nnational and local levels to plan and implement\nmeasures to increase resilience to climate change.\nThis will be carried out within the framework of a\nclimate change resilience program, integrated into\nmultisectoral rural development and based on upto-date and accurate data and forecasts.\n\nAt national level, government agencies should\nassume a coherent leadership role within a strong\nlegislative and policy framework. The national\ngovernment should effectively allocate human and\nfinancial resources to agricultural and water\nmanagement for climate resilience. The national\ngovernment should be able to use greater capacity\nto absorb and attract climate-related funding from\nthe international realm. National administrative and\ntechnical agencies, in partnership with civil society\norganizations, can provide timely and accurate\ntechnical support to local governments and\ncommunities. This will be based on a sufficient\nunderstanding of climate change, climate variability\nand its implications through a prioritization process.\n\nAt local level, communities should identify and\nprioritize measures and undertake programs and\nprojects that incorporate livelihoods activities that\nreduce their vulnerability, in particular with respect\nto climate change and climate variability. This will\ninclude developing infrastructures as well as\nprotective measures such as good agricultural and\nwater management practices, tree planting, ceasing\nenvironmentally harmful practices, and further\ndiversification of environmentally and socially\nsustainable\nlivelihood\nactivities.\nCommunities\nshould also use their increased knowledge of\nclimate change to clearly articulate their demands\nwith local and national government, and to secure\nadditional funding for appropriate and effective\nactivities.\n\nLessons learned can be disseminated at local,\nnational\nand\ninternational\nlevels\nso\nthat\ncommunities can share best practices with other\nlocal communities. National policy integration\nprocesses that have successfully incorporated\nclimate change will be recorded so that they can be\nreplicated in other sectoral policies when new\nfunding becomes available.\n\n6.2.4 Climate Mitigation in the context of existing strategies and policies\nGuinea-Bissau has acceded to the UNFCCC\nCopenhagen Agreement with several dozen other\ncountries. The agreement promotes measures by\ndeveloping countries and industrialized countries\nto limit emissions in the medium term and the\nfinancing organization to take the necessary\nactions.\nAs\nthe\nprocess\nprogresses,\nthe\ncommitments of all countries (developed and\ndeveloping) to lower emissions, as well as the\nfunding frameworks, are recognized. Guinea-Bissau\nis currently seeking funding to draw up its NAMA\nStrategy and REDD + Strategy.\n\n104 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nThus, the forest in Guinea-Bissau plays an important\nrole in both adapting and mitigating climate\nchange. However, the view that the forest is a\nbalancing factor for the earth's ecosystems and\nprocesses and not just a natural resource to be\nexploited is not yet understood by policy makers\nand the population. In 2010 a diagnosis was made\nto lay the foundations for a new forest policy, but\nthe process was halted. The vision is for sustainable\nmanagement of forest resources - namely through\nthe conservation and restoration of forest heritage\n- to foster a socio-economic balance of meeting the\nneeds of communities and their accountability.\nProposed guiding principles include: biodiversity\nconservation,\nsustainable\nland\nmanagement,\nresearch and research and forest teaching,\nvalorisation of forest and wildlife resources that\nfavour economic development and environmental\nimprovement, promotion of agro-forest-pastoral\nmanagement, participation and communities’\naccountability in the design, implementation,\nmonitoring and evaluation of forest activities\nthrough decentralized management. However,\nforests continue to be heavily pressurized either by\ntraditional thinning practices for agriculture, slash &\nburn practice, charcoal production or by the latest\nrampant exploitation of forest resources and their\nlarge-scale commercialization (after the 2012 coup\nd'état).\n\nCapacity building for the implementation of Trade\nLaw, Governance and Regulation (FLEGT) is urgent.\nThis involves the elaboration of the forest inventory\nand forest management instruments with reserve\nareas and exploration areas for various purposes, in\nanticipation of massive reforestation. It should be\nnoted that the new government that came out of\nthe 2014 elections introduced a 5-year moratorium\nthat prohibits logging and timber exports. This will\nreduce pressure on forests and consequently\nnatural regeneration and restoration of forest\nheritage.\n\n6.2.5 Climate Adaptation in the context of existing strategies and policies\nGovernance in Guinea Bissau is based on\narticulation between the Central Government and\nRegional Governments. Regional governments\nhave very limited means to meet their obligations.\nSome Ministries have delegations in different\nregions. Aware of the fragility of the ecosystems\nand vulnerabilities that characterize the country and\nas part of the UNFCCC implementation, the\nGovernment of Guinea-Bissau has developed basic\ninstruments to prepare the country for possible\nadaptation measures. Thus, the Initial National\nCommunication, the National Climate Change\nAdaptation Action Program (NAPA), the Second\nNational Communication and the Third National\nCommunication were prepared.\n\nAwareness of climate change has progressively\nincreased among policy makers and the wider\ncommunity. Thus, the country through the National\nPeople's Assembly (ANP) ratified the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity\n(CBD) and the United Nations Convention to\nCombat Desertification (UNCCD) on October 27,\n1995.\n\nPalácio Colinas de Boé – Assembleia Nacional Popular\n\nAs part of its obligations, the country approved the\nNational Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan\n(December 2006), the National Biodiversity Strategy\nand Action Plan (Decree 3/2004 of 19 May) and the\nNational Action Program to Combat Drought and\nDesertification (2006 and a new PAN / LCD in 2011).\nThe country ratified the Kyoto Protocol through\nResolution No. 14 / PL / ANP / 2005 of 2 March,\nmaking a commitment to develop, update, publish\nand participate in the Conferences of the Parties\n(COP) national inventories of GHG emissions and\nremovals. Greenhouse Effect (GHG). It has already\nprepared three National Communications on\nclimate change and is preparing its BUR1.\n\n105 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nThere is absence of legislation related to land use\nplanning and town planning, ie there is no urban\nplanning. In the case of the General Regulations on\nConstruction\nand\nUrban\nHousing,\nclimate\nsafeguards are not yet included. These gaps make\nclimate change adaptation planning and climate\nrisk management difficult, as many of the decisions\nthat impact on the ability of the territory and society\nto adapt to the effects of climate change can be\nmade in spatial planning.\nThe national (political, strategic, institutional and\nprogrammatic)\nframework\nfor\ndisaster\nrisk\nreduction is under development. A National Civil\nProtection Service has been set up and a draft legal\ndraft has been prepared for the creation of the\nNational Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction\n(PNRRC) and a “National Strategy for Disaster Risk\nReduction” - both are to be analysis of the Council\nof Ministers. The National Risk Reduction Strategy\nincludes food insecurity, epidemics, extreme\nweather events, coastal erosion, fires but will have\nto first study vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Coastal Zone Master Plan, prepared in 1993\nwith the support of IUCN, was an important\nmilestone in the sustainable development of the\ncountry. The plan was aimed at the development of\nthe coastal zone, but also the conservation of\nnatural\nresources,\ncoastal\necosystems\nand\nbiodiversity. Following this plan, important actions\nemerged, such as the creation of the Orango, João\nVieira and Poilão, Cacheu, Cufada and Cantanhez\nnature parks and the Bijagos Biosphere Reserve\nproject.\n\n6.3 Presentation of current climate change adaptation initiatives and\nperspectives\nThe country's first exercise to pursue initiatives to\npromote the fight against climate change and longterm climate variability was carried out under NAPA\n(2006). According to NAPA (2006) it was possible to\ngauge the level of exposure of the sectors to\nclimate risks based on the sensitivity matrix analysis\nwhich showed that the sector with the highest\nexposure was agriculture with 57%, followed by\nlivestock and health both with 54%, followed by the\nfisheries with 51% and infrastructure with 46%.\n\nAgain as a result of the NAPA exercise, the\nidentification of particularly vulnerable social\ngroups was made possible on the basis of available\nsocio-economic\nindicators,\nparticularly\nthose\nprovided by the Light Poverty Assessment Survey\n(ILAP) and indications of the impact of climate\nchange on the sectors of activity acknowledged in\nthe process of preparation. Subsistence small\nfarmers were found to be the 1st most vulnerable\ngroup (54%), followed by livestock farmers (49%),\nwaged workers living in large cities (46%) and\nfishermen (34%).\n\nShort-term objective\nThus, in the context of information of this BUR 1, the\nnational short-term objective, was to implement the\nfollowing actions with the financial, technological\nand\ncapacity-building\nsupport\nfrom\nthe\ninternational community:\n― The already achieved increase in the percentage\nof protected areas from 15% to 26% and beyond\nensuring their management,\n― The effective implementation of the Forest Law\nand the moratorium on banning logging and\nexportation over the next five years;\n― Conduct a national forest inventory;\n―Develop agro-ecological zoning and forest\nmanagement;\n― Strengthen the existing capacity in order to\nparticipate in the REDD + mechanism and thereby\nincrease the national effort to tackle the damaging\nimpacts of climate change.\n― Enhance the adaptability of national ecosystems\nby enhancing soil protection against water and\nwind erosion and protecting the coast from rising\nsea levels and other types of erosion.\n\nMedium- and long-term objective\nIn the medium- and long-term Guinea-Bissau is\nconditionally committed, depending on financial,\ntechnological and capacity building support from\nthe international community stemming from the\nnew Climate and Green Fund Agreements to:\n― Develop a national reforestation and sustainable\nmanagement program for forest and agroforestry\necosystems by 2025;\n― Develop scientific and technical research on\nadaptation of new productive varieties with broad\nspectrum tolerance to the harmful effect of climate\nby 2025;\n\n106 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\n― Reduce illegal and indiscriminate logging by\n2030;\n― Foster forestry / plantation of species resistant\nto drought and low rainfall by 2030;\n― Develop\nan\nIntegrated\nCoastal\nZone\nManagement Program by 2025;\n― Implement 80% of renewable energy in the\nnational energy matrix by 2030;\n― Increase energy efficiency – by reducing energy\nlosses up to 10% over time by 2030;\n― Promote 80% of universal access to electricity by\n2030;\n― While a SIDS Member state, develop a Country\nClimate Change Vulnerability & Resilience Profile.\n\nThe long-term objectives\nThe long-term objectives are the introduction of\nclimate proofing in business sectors through\nestablishments / introduction of:\n― Short cycle drought resistant seeds;\n― Hydro-agricultural planning;\n― Introduction of culture techniques resilient to\nthe effects of climate change;\n― Introduction of fast-growing fodder plants for\nanimal feed;\n― Preparation of contingency plans for the\nmanagement of climate risks and natural disasters;\n― Rainwater harvesting and storage (water\nretention basins and mini dams) for dry season\nwater management;\n― Construction of grain and seed banks;\n― Infrastructures (roads, bridges, houses, etc.).\n\nCurrently and still taking into account the results of\nNAPA, the country is making efforts to implement a\nseries of projects and initiatives some already\nunderway or foreseen to be implemented in the\nnear future on the theme of climate change\nadaptation. Some of these initiatives are presented\nbelow:\n\n(i) Climate Change and Coastline Adaptation\nProject: Response to Coastal Change and Its\nHuman Dimensions in West Africa under Integrated\nCoastal Zone Management (ACCC). Following\nstudies carried out in the years 2000-2003 on the\ncontinent of Africa, during the African Process for\nthe Development and Protection of the Coastal and\nMarine Environment, the ACCC project emerged.\nThis process has chosen three priorities: coastal\nerosion, the impacts of climate change on coastal\nzones and the application of integrated coastal\nzone management.\nThe ACCC Project aimed to strengthen the\nadaptability of local communities and the resilience\nof the coastal ecosystems of the five West African\ncountries (Mauritania, Cape Verde, Senegal,\nGambia and Guinea-Bissau) to climate change. It\nhad as components:\n1. Implementation of pilot activities to enhance the\nadaptability and resilience of coastal ecosystems in\nareas vulnerable to the harmful effects of Climate\nChange;\n2. Integration of climate change and adaptation\nissues into coastal zone management policies and\nprograms.\n\n(ii) Adaptation and resilience building project for\ncoastal areas and communities vulnerable to\nclimate change in Guinea-Bissau (portfolio)\nIn partnership with UNDP and submitted to the LDC\nFund, the project aims to strengthen the resilience\nand adaptability of communities and coastal\ninvestments to the impacts of climate change. The\nproject has three main components:\n\n1. Enhanced policies, regulations, institutions and\nindividuals mandated to manage coastal zones to\nreduce the risks of climate change;\n2. Vulnerability of coastal investments to reduced\nclimate risks through the design, construction and\nmaintenance of coastal protection measures;\n3. Rural livelihoods in the coastal zone reinforced\nand protected from climate change impacts\n\niii) Stepping up smart agriculture in eastern\nGuinea-Bissau\n-\nScaling\nup\nclimate-smart\nagriculture in East Guinea Bissau (in portfolio). In\npartnership with the West African Development\nBank (BOAD) and submitted to the Adaptation\nFund, the project aims to strengthen farmers'\ncapacities for smart agriculture while enhancing\nadaptation\nand\nclimate\nrisk\nplanning\nand\nmanagement capacities at all levels of governance\nThe project also aims to solidify and broaden the\nactions developed by the project \"Strengthening\nresilience and adaptability of the agrarian and water\nsectors to changes in Guinea-Bissau\", from the 14\nintervention villages in the Gabu region to 26 in the\n\n107 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nGabu regions. and Bafata, with a total beneficiary\npopulation of 37,000. The project will address\nvulnerability in agriculture and water management,\nas\nwell\nas\ncontributing\nto\nthe\nlong-term\ndevelopment of resilience needs of extremely\nvulnerable farmers, with a particular focus on\nextremely vulnerable groups: women, the elderly\nand children. The project has three specific\nobjectives:\n1. Develop the technical and institutional capacity of\ngovernment and civil society (private sector, local\ncommunities and NGOs) to address the growing\nclimate risks in climate change adaptation planning;\n2. Increase the resilience of existing agricultural\nproduction\nsystems\nand\ncontribute\nto\nthe\ndiversification of production, notably through the\nimplementation of climate resistant actions such as\nwater management to minimize the risks of severe\ndroughts and floods;\n3. Promote the dissemination of lessons learned on\nknowledge of smart agriculture and adaptation\nplanning in other regions of the country, other West\nAfrican countries, and international climate change\nnegotiations and fora, including those of the\nUNFCCC.\n\nMain square in Bafatá with Amílcar Cabral bust, Bafatá, GuineaBissau8.\n\niv) Guinea-Bissau Resilience Project to Climate Change and Increasing Food Security (in portfolio)\nIn partnership with UNDP and FAO, it aims to develop and operationalize a National Agro-Ecological\nZoning System (NAEZ) to support decision-making in land use management, increased agricultural\nproductivity and reduced vulnerability to climate change. It is based on the fact that Guinea-Bissau's\neconomy is largely dependent on land and climate productivity, and mainly on rainfall patterns, and given\nthe predictions of climate change it is critical to prepare the country for adaptations in its agriculture to\nensure the food security of the population and make farming increasingly profitable and sustainable.\n\nColonial old town of Bafatá, the capital of Bafatá Region9\nPhoto credit: jbdodane\n\nThe system to be operationalized is based on plant\nproductivity models, data and maps already\ndeveloped by FAO to a coarse scale, but its practical\napplication\nin\nGuinea-Bissau\nrequires:\ni)\nparameterization of the main suitable crops\n(including\nbiofuels);\nii)\nsmall\nsoftware\ndevelopments; iii) construction of fine resolution\nspatial\ndatabases\nincluding\nmeteorological\ninformation; iv) data collection and soil mapping; v)\ntraining of technicians; vi) awareness raising and\nownership of information by farmers and local\nassociations.\n\n108 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nAs main results, it is expected to set up a NAEZ\nsystem that produces high resolution maps for\nagricultural\nmanagement,\nproviding\ndecision\nsupport in the use of fertilizers and / or irrigation\nfor present climate and future climate forecasts. The\nsystem and the information it produces (including\nmaps) underlie field interventions by Agricultural\nExtension Services, local communities and other\nstakeholders. Interventions will be designed to\nincrease the resilience of local populations to\nincreases in rainfall variability and, at the same time,\nincrease productivity and return on agricultural\nproducts. This will reduce human pressure on\necosystems\nand\npromote\na\nreversal\nof\nenvironmental degradation phenomena.\n\n109 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\n6.4 References and Footnotes\n\n―\nAfrican Development Bank (2001a) Key issues in forestry sector to year 2020 in the West African\n―\nSustainable Agriculture in Guinea-Bissau Increasing Production. 2018. https://borgenproject.org/sustainableagriculture-in-guinea-bissau/\n―\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pu.html\n―\nProjecto de Dinamização dos Sistemas de Produção Pecuários nos Sectores de Pitche e Gabu BALAL\nGAINAKO (contrato DCI-NSAPVD 2010 / 257–105).
